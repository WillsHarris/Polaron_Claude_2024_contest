Minnesota flood has exposed the inequity,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/07/03/produce-farmers-lack-crop-insurance-minnesota-flood-has-exposed-the-inequity/,2024-07-03 18:26,2024-07-03 18:31,ARM,,"NORTHFIELD, Minnesota ‚Äî The tomatillos hang in small-green balls from the vine, water-logged. The chilis sprouting up in a mucky row are puny. The garbanzo: Finished.Floods killed these crops. But unlike the large corn and soybean spreads in south central Minnesota ‚Äî dotted with ponds after historic June flooding ‚Äî federal crop insurance covers none of these crops.‚ÄúLast year‚Äôs harvest would fill baskets,‚Äù said Erika Gomez of Tierra de Esperanza Farm, a quarter-acre operation on the grounds of Sharing Our Roots farm in rural Dakota County.Gomez said in Spanish through a translator that one day last year, she and her partner picked 600 pounds of produce to sell at local markets. But now, with a wave of her hand, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone.‚ÄùThe southern Minnesota floods last month drenched already soggy fields across the region. The federal government will reimburse most grain farmers under a risk-management system Congress wrote and U.S. Department of Agriculture carried forward. At a press conference last week in the St. Paul Air National Guard Armory, Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during a tour of flood impacted areas, locals kept telling her they were ‚Äúkeeping [their] receipts,‚Äù knowing help from Uncle Sam was on its way.But at the very same press conference, Minnesota Department of Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen noted, ‚ÄúSome of the vegetable farms that are drowned out ‚Ä¶ a lot of those folks don‚Äôt have crop insurance.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs because U.S. agriculture policy, historically, hasn‚Äôt protected this category of growers the same as row-crop farmers who feed animals and power biofuels.These farmers ‚Äî call them specialty crops growers, produce or food farmers ‚Äî raise the fresh fruits and vegetables Americans eat, from almonds to grapes to raisins. In Minnesota, these growers tend to strawberries, cucumbers and kohlrabi sold in church parking lots at farmer‚Äôs market or food stands on the highway. They cultivate using hand tools and pick by hand at harvest, often on marginal lands. Many are immigrants, Black, Latino or Asian. Many are women.And many don‚Äôt have a safety net. According to the Minnesota Farmers‚Äô Market Association‚Äôs (MFMA) review of federal data, of the 3,600-plus vegetable farmers, only eight of them had purchased so-called ‚Äúmicro farm‚Äù policies as of late June.This week at Sharing Our Roots, a non-profit, incubator farm on 163 acres of an old slough north of Northfield, growers are still coming to terms with a lost season. The farm‚Äôs administration said some growers have lost up to $40,000 this summer.‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get crop insurance for almost anything,‚Äù said Delanie Harrmann of So Below Apothecary, who grows botanicals for tea blends. Harmann is in only her third year of growing, and even federally subsidized ‚Äúmicro farm‚Äù policies require three years of farming for insurance eligibility. The water‚Äôs impact on her farm this season: ‚ÄúDevastating.‚ÄùThe fight to increase access to insurance for specialty crop growers has been a long struggle in agriculture.A 2023 report by a group of small farmer advocates in Minnesota, including the MFMA, suggested changes to a USDA insurance program for smaller farmers, including improving incentives for growers and insurers. Other groups are eyeing the still-stalled Farm Bill before Congress to give smaller vegetable farmers a leg-up.On Monday, the Biden Administration approved a 22-county disaster declaration for the area flooding impacted this summer, unlocking federal dollars to pay back towns for cleaning up damage and sending aid to farmers for lost crops. The MDA encouraged farmers to report losses to the county USDA office. State-backed loans with zero interest are also available to farmers who lost revenue.On Tuesday in Northfield, Moffat Odwere of Moffado Farm, stood in a field inspecting the tender green shoots, what remained of his cabbage. The Kenyan immigrant, farming on his own for the first time, lamented the loss of millet and managu, traditional African greens.‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to succeed,‚Äù Odwere said, shaking his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a kind of panic.‚ÄùAccording to the latest agricultural census, farmers of color make up a larger percentage of the state‚Äôs vegetable farms than the overall percentage of BIPOC farmers in the state. Many of those farmers are beginners or at least new to working land in the U.S. For them, the washed-away fields are a lifeline to next year.At the packing shed, a neighbor, Samuel Nyarige, cleaned zucchinis he‚Äôd picked that morning. He called the crop ‚Äúterrible.‚Äù The ground was soggy. Black mud caked to his boots. Still, he removed a hose and rinsed the crop. Any bounty helps now.‚ÄúWe looked at the next seven days, and it‚Äôs all rain,‚Äù Lucia Possehl, the farm‚Äôs commons cohort program manager, adding the farm launched a climate relief fund and issued $500 checks to everyone.As the morning wore on, more farmers arrived in trucks. Some brought garden hoes, others bags of new seeds to plant with hopes for sunshine.Erica Gomez works and assesses the damage to her crops at Sharing Our Roots due to recent and ongoing flooding in Northfield, Minnesota, on Tuesday, July 2, 2024.

djkMtbIN1knU46a,Seeking Alpha,bing,Qualcomm: Huawei And Samsung News And Current Outlook,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702352-qualcomm-huawei-and-samsung-news-and-current-outlook,2024-07-03 18:38,2024-07-03 18:53,INTC,,"JHVEPhoto Article Thesis QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) (""Qualcomm"") is a semiconductor player with appealing growth and AI tailwinds that trades at a valuation that is far from high. While shares have moved up nicely this year, Qualcomm remains an attractive long-term investment at current prices. Past Coverage I have covered Qualcomm Incorporated in the past here on Seeking Alpha, most recently in early May, where I took a look at the company's most recent quarterly earnings results. I gave QCOM a ""Buy"" rating back then, which has worked out well so far, as shares are up 14% since then. With Qualcomm receiving attention due to a couple of news items and with its next earnings results coming up this month (post-market July 31st), it is time to take another look at the semiconductor company. Qualcomm: Recent News Over the last couple of days, Qualcomm was in the news a couple of times: The first news item is related to sanctions against Chinese tech player Huawei. Several supplier or export licenses were revoked by the U.S. government, which had allowed companies such as Qualcomm to export their chips to Huawei, so the Chinese tech giant could use them to manufacture smartphones, notebooks, and so on. Among the affected companies with revoked licenses are Qualcomm and Intel Corporation (INTC). While Huawei's flagship phones use chips made by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (OTCQX:SIUIF), such as the Kirin 9000 series, Western semiconductor companies have still been supplying chips and technology to Huawei. The fact that a couple of export licenses have now been revoked is a negative, but far from a disaster for both QCOM and INTC. After all, Huawei is just one manufacturer of smartphones, notebooks, and so on among many others, and both companies have likely known for years that the revenues that could be generated via sales to Huawei were far from set in stone. After all, many export licenses had not been greenlighted in the past, either, and Western chip companies had more than enough time to adjust to this fact and to focus on Western (or Western-aligned) customers such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) or Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTCPK:SSNLF). I thus do not believe that recent changes in export licensing change the bullish thesis for Qualcomm. Another news item we recently got is that a newly introduced Samsung laptop, the Galaxy Book 4 Edge, was struggling with some software from Adobe Inc. (ADBE) and some popular games such as Fortnite. Since Qualcomm is the supplier of the CPUs used in the Galaxy Book 4 Edge, this news was tied to QCOM, and shares pulled back. But while it is an issue that Samsung's new notebook, branded as an AI notebook, is having trouble running some common software, I believe that it is highly likely that this isn't Qualcomm's fault. After all, problems with a couple of specific programs seem more like a compatibility problem stemming from the operating system, missing or incompatible drivers, and so on. Moreover, the Galaxy Book 4 Edge isn't a gaming device anyway, so potential customers will, I assume, not mind issues with a couple of specific games too much. For those interested in gaming, dedicated gaming devices are better suited than a power-efficient and slim notebook anyway. While Qualcomm got some negative news here, I believe that this isn't a long-term problem for the company. Its Snapdragon chips aren't really made for gaming (and aren't branded as gaming chips), and it seems likely to me that QCOM's chips aren't the issue when it comes to the notebook's problems in running some specific programs. The third news item related to Qualcomm is a report by Bank of America Corporation (BAC) about active managers increasing their exposure to the company, even though active managers reduced their exposure to the overall semiconductor industry. In other words, active managers have increased their exposure to QCOM relative to other chip companies -- which could be a positive indicator for Qualcomm, as these active managers wouldn't increase their exposure if they thought that Qualcomm was a bad pick. These active managers seem to believe that QCOM is more promising compared to the average chip company, which is a positive sign -- although these money allocators might be wrong, and thus outperformance isn't guaranteed, of course. Qualcomm: Earnings Outlook Later this month, Qualcomm will report its fiscal third-quarter earnings results. So far, the outlook is quite positive: Wall Street analysts are forecasting an increase of 9% when it comes to the company's revenues, with the top-line being expected at $9.2 billion. Over the last couple of months, we have seen many upward revisions, which means that analysts may increase their estimates further until the company's earnings results are announced. Over the last three years or twelve quarters, Qualcomm has beaten the consensus revenue estimate ten times. The company thus has a track record of outperforming expectations. Thus, I wouldn't be very surprised if QCOM managed to beat the consensus estimate once more with its upcoming report. A revenue increase of 10%+ thus seems possible for sure, although it is not set in stone. Revenue growth will be driven by contributing factors such as higher licensing revenue and growth in the automotive business -- the automotive business showed a revenue growth rate of 35% during the most recent quarter. When it comes to profits, Qualcomm is forecasted to see a steep 20% increase on a per-share basis. This growth will be driven by the expected revenue increase, operating leverage (operating costs are distributed over a larger revenue and gross profit base), and share repurchases, which give a nice little extra boost to QCOM's earnings per share number thanks to a declining share count number. When it comes to its past earnings per share performance, relative to expectations, Qualcomm again has a strong track record. It has beaten the analyst consensus in 10 out of the last 12 quarters, thus another earnings beat wouldn't be much of a surprise. But even if QCOM doesn't beat estimates this time, the expected 20% earnings per share increase would be a pretty strong result. QCOM: Significant Long-Term Potential When it comes to a stock's total return potential over the long run, several factors are important. Valuation plays a role, of course, due to potential total return tailwinds from multiple expansion and potential total return headwinds from multiple compression. Underlying earnings per share growth plays a role as well, and finally, dividends can have a major impact on the returns an investor sees over time. While Qualcomm is not a bargain at 20x forward net profits, it is far from expensive. Many other chip companies, including ones with weaker growth such as Intel, are trading at higher valuations. Other AI-exposed chip players such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) or Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) trade at much higher valuations compared to QCOM -- AMD is valued at 47x this year's earnings, while Broadcom trades at 35x this year's earnings. On a relative basis, QCOM thus could have some upside potential. The earnings growth outlook is positive as well, thanks to underlying market growth in areas such as handsets and the emerging automotive business. Add margin tailwinds from operating leverage and buybacks, and QCOM could grow its earnings per share at a nice pace over the coming years. Analysts are forecasting earnings per share growth of 18%, 14%, and 10% for the current year, next year, and the one after that. If those estimates are hit, QCOM will earn $12.50 in fiscal 2026 -- put a 22x earnings multiple on that, and QUALCOMM would trade at $275 a little more than two years from now, which would make for a nice share price return of 35% compared to the current share price of $204. When we include the dividend, the total return would be even better, at close to 40% over the next two years -- even if QCOM does not outperform earnings per share estimates going forward, while it has done so in the past. Even if Qualcomm were to trade at just 18x net earnings two years from now, investors would see their shares rise to $225, which would make for a return of 14% including dividends over the next two years -- not especially great, but still far from bad. QCOM could thus generate reasonable total returns even if its valuation were to decline by 10%, which means that we do not need bullish assumptions for QCOM to be a solid investment. Takeaway The reaction to the recent Samsung notebook news seems overblown to me, and since Qualcomm has an appealing growth outlook, a compelling shareholder return program, and an undemanding valuation, I remain bullish on this chip player. I am very happy with my position so far.  Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

PM3TDlCS7KPw2nl,Yahoo Finance,yahoo,Chevron Corporation (CVX): Why Are Analysts Bullish on This Dividend Aristocrat Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-corporation-cvx-why-analysts-225421919.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,2024-07-03 18:54,2024-07-03 19:03,CVX,,"We recently compiled a list of the Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against the other dividend aristocrats.Investors have always put income at the top of their list. And when it comes to raking in money, you can‚Äôt beat dividend stocks. Research by S&P Dow Jones Indices has demonstrated that over the long haul, dividend-paying companies have outperformed non-dividend companies and the broader market on a risk-adjusted basis. Though investing in high dividend yields is not advised by analysts, recent research indicates that dividend yield is a risk factor that pays off, historically earnings higher returns than a market-cap-weighted benchmark. When paired with other factors like volatility, quality, momentum, size, and value, dividend yield strategies can potentially tap into systematic sources of returns.Dividend yield and dividend growth have always been a hot topic among investors. But little did they realize that dividend yield is a key piece of the puzzle when it comes to dividend growth. When it comes to the Dividend Aristocrats Index, the knack for increasing dividends for 25 straight years doesn‚Äôt mean sacrificing yield. The index has consistently outshone its benchmark by delivering higher yields, typically between 2% and 2.9% over the past 26 years ending 2023. On average, the index‚Äôs yield was 2.5%, compared to the market‚Äôs 1.8%. To read more about high dividend stocks, have a look at Best Dividend Stocks Yielding at Least 7% According to Hedge Funds.In addition to offering solid yields, dividend aristocrats are also less volatile than other asset classes. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has outpaced the broader market over the long haul with less volatility, which is indicated by its higher risk-adjusted returns. The index‚Äôs ability to provide downside protection is evident in its upside and downside capture ratio. These stocks have outperformed the market in 69.34% of down months and 43.61% of up months. Moreover, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has experienced lower drawdowns compared to the benchmark index. The report further mentioned that the index delivered an average excess return of 1.05% during down months compared to the broad-based benchmark.Data from 2023 highlights how eager companies are to boost their dividends. This isn't just a knee-jerk move to lure investors; it's backed by robust corporate balance sheets, with companies raking in more cash flows than ever before. According to Janus Henderson, corporate cash flow remained strong in 2023 across most sectors, giving companies ample resources for dividends and share buybacks. As a result, global dividend growth saw a 5% increase for the year, aligning with the long-term trend. The firm also gave a positive outlook for dividends in 2024. It said that dividends appear solidly supported this year, although one-time special dividends are expected to decrease from the record levels observed over the past three years. The firm‚Äôs forecast predicts $1.72 trillion in dividends for 2024, marking a 3.9% increase on a headline basis, which translates to a 5% growth rate on a headline basis.Story continuesThere are many dividend aristocrats that offer solid yields to shareholders. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks with high yields.Our Methodology:For this list, we looked at a group of 67 dividend aristocrat companies, which are known for raising dividends for 25 years or more. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of June 25 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey‚Äôs database of 920 funds as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).An aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Dividend Yield as of June 25: 4.10%Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) ranks seventh on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks. The American energy company manufactures and sells fuels, additives, petrochemicals, and lubricants. Oil companies are consistently favorable for dividend investors because they are known for paying hefty dividends to shareholders. Even when low oil prices impact their cash flow, they often take on debt and leverage assets to maintain their payouts. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is also generous with its dividend payments, despite crude oil prices fluctuating within a narrow range over the past few months and remaining below their 2022 peak of $120. In the first quarter of 2024, the company reported $6.8 billion in operating cash flow and its cash flow for the quarter came in at $2.7 billion. During the quarter, it returned $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This was the company's eighth consecutive quarter of generating shareholder returns of over $5 billion.As an integrated oil and gas company, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) manages both upstream and downstream operations. This integrated model is effective because it balances the fluctuations in oil and gas prices. When prices rise, the company's upstream operations can see substantial gains. For example, it generated $30 billion in operating income in 2022 due to higher oil prices. The company utilized this windfall to boost stock buybacks, reduce debt, and pursue acquisitions.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list, has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 37 years. Moreover, it has paid regular dividends to shareholders since 1984. The company's quarterly dividend comes in at $1.63 per share for a dividend yield of 4.10%, as of June 25.Insider Monkey's database of Q1 2024 showed that 62 hedge funds owned stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), worth collectively over $23.2 billion. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company, valued at over $19.3 billion. The hedge fund started investing in the company during the third quarter of 2020. Since this, the stock has surged by over 104%.Overall CVX ranks 7th on our list of the best dividend aristocrats ranked by yield. You can visit Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10¬†to see the other dividend stocks that are on hedge funds‚Äô radar. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than CVX but that trades at less than 7 times its earnings and yields nearly 10%, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.READ NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion ""Opportunity"" for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.Disclosure: None.

wFWO63Pka6P64XD,CNN,google,Former Boeing inspector alleges ‚Äòscrap‚Äô parts ended up on assembly lines,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/03/business/former-boeing-inspector-scrap-parts-assembly-lines/index.html,2024-07-03 20:00,2024-07-03 20:07,BA,,"CNN        ¬†‚Äî¬†                A former Boeing quality-control manager alleges that for years workers at its 787 Dreamliner factory in Everett, Washington, routinely took parts that were deemed unsuitable to fly out of an internal scrap yard and put them back on factory assembly lines¬†.                In his first network TV interview, Merle Meyers, a 30-year veteran of Boeing, described to CNN what he says was an elaborate off-the-books practice that Boeing managers at the Everett factory used to meet production deadlines, including taking¬†damaged and improper parts from the company‚Äôs scrapyard, storehouses and loading docks.                A string of whistleblowers this year has raised allegations about Boeing factory lapses, including an official federal complaint¬†from a current employee¬†that Boeing hid potentially defective parts from Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, and that some of those parts likely ended up in planes.                This all comes in the wake of a series of highly public safety issues that have rocked the company.                Meyers‚Äô claims that lapses he witnessed¬†were intentional, organized efforts designed to thwart quality control processes in an effort to keep¬†up with demanding production schedules.                Beginning in the early 2000s, Meyers says that for more than a decade, he estimates that about 50,000 parts ‚Äúescaped‚Äù quality control¬†and were used to build aircraft. Those parts include everything from small items like screws to more complex assemblies like wing flaps. A single Boeing 787 Dreamliner, for example, has approximately 2.3 million parts.                Most of the parts that were meant to be scrapped were often painted red to signify they were unsuitable for assembly lines, Meyers said. Yet, in some cases, that didn‚Äôt stop them¬† from being put into planes being assembled, he said.                ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge problem,‚Äù Meyers told CNN. ‚ÄúA core requirement of a quality system is to keep bad parts and good parts apart.‚Äù                Airplanes are highly specified machines with much stricter safety standards than trains and cars. Their parts, materials and manufacturing processes are highly regulated.                Meyers, whose job was to find quality problems at Boeing, says he believes he was forced out last year and says he was given a severance package that he is unable to discuss due to a privacy agreement he signed with Boeing.                Based on conversations Meyers says he had with current Boeing workers in the time since he left the company, he believes that while employees no longer remove parts from the scrapyard, the practice of using other unapproved¬†parts in assembly lines continues.                ‚ÄúNow they‚Äôre back to taking parts of body sections ‚Äì everything ‚Äì right when it arrives at the Everett site, bypassing quality, going right to the airplane,‚Äù Meyers said.                Company emails going back years show that Meyers repeatedly flagged the issue to Boeing‚Äôs corporate investigations team, pointing out what he says were blatant violations of Boeing‚Äôs safety rules. But investigators¬†routinely failed to enforce those rules, Meyers says, even ignoring ‚Äúeye witness observations¬†and the hard work done to ensure the safety of future passengers and crew,‚Äù he wrote in an internal 2022 email provided to CNN.                Meyers has also described his concerns about Boeing‚Äôs quality issues to federal investigators, a Senate panel and the New York Times.                In a statement to CNN, Boeing did not dispute Meyers‚Äô allegations. The company said it investigates ‚Äúall allegations of improper behavior, such as unauthorized movement of parts or mishandling of documents,‚Äù and makes improvements when appropriate.        Swirl of controversy            Meyers‚Äô allegations come as Boeing faces a swirl of controversy over its safety culture, including a criminal investigation into whether it misled the FAA over its 2017 certification of the 737 Max. A total of 346 people were killed in two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. As CNN reported over the weekend, the Justice Department is nearing an agreement with Boeing which would resolve potential criminal liability.                In January, a door plug blew off of a 737 Max mid-flight, prompting a wave of intense scrutiny of the airplane manufacturer, including federal and congressional investigations. Boeing‚Äôs CEO Dave Calhoun has announced he will step down by the end of this year. To address its safety issues, Boeing recently agreed to purchase supplier Spirit AeroSystems.

A current Boeing quality investigator, Sam Mohawk, also filed an official complaint last month reporting ‚Äúa number of non-compliant parts making their way back to the airplanes for installation.‚Äù His complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was publicly released by a Senate subcommittee investigating Boeing.                Mohawk‚Äôs complaint said the issue of disappearing nonconforming parts continues.¬†‚ÄúBoeing is still losing parts to this day,‚Äù his official complaint reads.                A separate whistleblower, Richard Cuevas, last week made public his concerns that Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems used compromised parts and made changes to ‚Äúreduce bottlenecks in production and speed up production and delivery.‚Äù        Pulled from the scrapyard            The pressure from Boeing management to keep assembly lines moving is no secret.¬†The 245-page House investigative report after the 737 Max fatal crashes dedicates an entire chapter to ‚ÄúProduction Pressure.‚Äù¬†After the January 5 door plug blowout on a 737 Max, the FAA capped¬†Boeing‚Äôs production line speed.                Meyers describes a pressure-packed environment at the Everett factory, where assembly teams competed with each other to find the parts they needed.                Meyers alleges that after hours, workers would ask security guards to unlock doors and sneak parts out of supply rooms, or remove newly arrived components awaiting quality inspections by Meyers‚Äô team.¬†Similar parts destined for a different airplane model were ripe for the taking.                At some point in the early 2000s, Boeing employees began also pulling parts from the company‚Äôs scrapyard in Auburn, Washington, located about an hour south¬†of the nearly 100-acre factory building¬†where Dreamliners were assembled,¬†according to documentation¬†Meyers shared with CNN. Nonconforming parts end up in the reclamation yard, Meyers says, only after being¬†rejected by three departments:¬†Engineering, procurement, and quality.    Workers assemble Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner airplanes at the Boeing Everett Factory in Everett, Washington.Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images            Meyers claims that by around 2002, employees at the reclamation yard became concerned that they would be considered responsible when scrap parts were later found on an aircraft.¬†So, they asked employees to sign for the removals ‚Äì but their homemade form wasn‚Äôt an official Boeing document, which meant the removal was never recorded in the company‚Äôs quality management database.                ‚ÄúThese are bootleg forms that are not Boeing authorized,‚Äù Meyers said.¬†‚ÄúThe procurement organization would go down to our scrap reclamation yard and intimidate the employees there and say we need these parts bad.‚Äù        Lack of enforcement            Meyers says he repeatedly referred violations for investigation but found the company‚Äôs efforts to look into them lacking.                ‚ÄúTheir investigations are about analyzing excuses by process violators, and not taking action against those committing compliance violations,‚Äù Meyers wrote in a 2002 email to corporate HR at Boeing¬†.    Merle Meyers, right, speaks to CNN's Pete Muntean.CNN            In its statement, Boeing said the quality team Meyers worked on ‚Äúplays an important role in identifying issues, improving processes, and strengthening compliance in our factories.‚Äù                ‚ÄúWe appreciate employees who raise their voice and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously,‚Äù the statement said.                Meyers says his Boeing managers did not know how to handle employees who raised concerns, and said that after decades at the company he was ultimately given¬†a list of management grievances with his work, and offered a vague opportunity to improve ‚Äì or take a cash payout and leave.                ‚ÄúI was given a list of things to correct ‚Äì it was my behaviors and my practices as a manager,‚Äù he said.¬†‚ÄúSo it looked like a personal improvement program ‚Ä¶ but it had a financial incentive with it ‚Äì or you can take this money and quit.‚Äù                Meyers said he never intended to become a whistleblower but is now speaking with those who ask ‚Äì including a Senate subcommittee probing Boeing ‚Äì to generate momentum for change.                ‚ÄúHopefully we can get this company to heal and be what it was,‚Äù he said.

Despite some officials advocating for potential rate hikes, the Federal Open Market Committee ultimately decided to hold rates steady.Job growth slowsPrivate payroll growth slowed in June, with companies adding 150,000 jobs compared to May's 157,000, according to ADP. This was¬†below expectations and marked the weakest growth since January, potentially signaling a cooling labor market. ""Job growth has been solid, but not broad-based,""¬†said¬†ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson.

Mach's oil production was slightly below the midpoint of its guidance, with winter weather reducing oil production by close to 650 barrels per day. Mach's natural gas production exceeded expectations, and it also has seen some positive results around reducing its D&C costs and operating costs. I am now modeling Mach's 2024 free cash flow at approximately $3.19 per unit, with a mid-to-high single digits decline in production from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024. Stronger natural gas prices in 2025 should benefit Mach and allow it to generate a similar amount of free cash flow despite lower production levels. The progress Mach has made with operating costs and D&C costs improves its estimated value by $1 per unit compared to when I looked at it in April and I now estimate its value at $18.75 to $21.35 per unit. Q1 2024 Production Mach reported approximately 89,000 BOEPD in production during Q1 2024. This was within its guidance range of 85,100 to 90,200 BOEPD for the quarter, and around 1.5% above the midpoint of that guidance range. This was driven by strong natural gas production, as its natural gas production averaged around 291.8 MMcf per day in Q1 2024, above its guidance range of 271 to 287 MMcf per day. Mach's production of oil and NGLs was within their respective guidance ranges, but towards the lower end. Mach indicated that its oil production was affected by downtime related to a January winter storm. This reduced its oil production by close to 60,000 barrels, and without that impact its oil production would have been modestly above its guidance midpoint for the quarter. Mach's production is expected to decline throughout 2024, with its Q4 2024 production guidance around -7% compared to its initial Q1 2024 production guidance. Operating Cost Performance Mach's Q1 2024 lease operating expense of $5.03 per BOE was relatively low compared to its full-year guidance for $6.00 to $6.30 per BOE. Due to declining production levels, I'd expect Mach's per BOE operating expense to increase a bit as time goes on. However, in terms of total dollars its lease operating expense still looks better than expected. The $41 million in lease operating expense it reported in Q1 2024 is less than the $47 million quarterly average in its guidance. Mach indicated that its Paloma acquisition (which closed near the end of 2023 and accounts for around one-third of its current production) helped drive down its lease operating expenses, which were at $6.90 per BOE in Q3 2023. On the other hand, Mach's gathering and processing costs were relatively high at $3.94 per BOE compared to its full-year guidance for $3.20 to $3.40 per BOE, so that offsets much of the benefit of its low lease operating expenses. Reduced D&C Costs Mach noted that it has also been able to reduce its D&C costs. It mentioned that its Oswego wells cost under $2.63 million per well on average for Q1 2024. This is down from a bit over $3 million per well in Q1 2023 and Mach's modeling around a $2.70 million to $2.75 million current well cost. Mach also believes that it can do better than expectations with drilling on its Paloma assets too, bringing down well costs $0.75 million to $1 million lower than its model. Mach's capex was slightly higher than expected for Q1 2024 as it drilled more higher working interest Oswego wells, but its lower cost per well should allow it to keep within budget for the full year. Updated 2024 Outlook Mach reaffirmed its full-year 2024 guidance. Based on its Q1 2024 results, it should be on track to meet its guidance for oil and NGLs, especially if there are no further weather related disruptions. I am now modeling Mach's natural gas production near the high-end of its full-year guidance, though, due to its Q1 2024 natural gas production exceeding guidance and the potential for more ethane rejection. The current strip is around $81 WTI oil and $2.40 Henry Hub natural gas, and I project Mach's revenues at $1.031 billion in this scenario.        Type Barrels/Mcf $ Per Barrel/Mcf $ Million   Oil 7,610,250 $80.00 $609   NGLs 7,026,250 $26.75 $188   Gas 98,550,500 $2.15 $212   Midstream Operating Profit     $18   Hedge Value     $4   Total Revenues     $1,031   Click to enlarge I am now modeling Mach's lease operating expense at $5.50 per BOE in 2024, with the expectation that it will be lower than its initial guidance. On the other hand, gathering and processing is modeled at $3.75 per BOE, higher than initial guidance. Mach's capex was a bit higher than expected in Q1 2024 due to those higher working interest Oswego wells. With the progress it has made in reducing D&C costs, though, Mach's full-year capex should be in-line with its initial guidance.      $ Million   Lease Operating $171   Gathering and Processing $116   Taxes Other Than Income $56   Cash G&A $32   Cash Interest $90   Capex $263   Total $728   Click to enlarge Mach is now projected to generate $303 million in 2024 free cash flow at current strip, or $3.19 per unit. Notes On Valuation I previously estimated Mach's value at $17.75 to $20.35 per unit based on long-term $75 WTI oil and $3.75 Henry Hub natural gas. Mach's projected 2024 free cash flow has increased slightly (by $0.14 per unit) since I last looked at it. Mach has also made some strides in reducing its D&C costs, while its lease operating expense looks to be lower than previously expected. On the other hand, Mach's gathering and processing costs appear to be trending higher than previously expected. Overall, I believe these items add approximately $1 per unit to Mach's value and I now estimate its value at $18.75 to $21.35 per unit. With over 50% of Mach's production being natural gas, it should also benefit from improved 2025 strip prices (with 2025 natural gas strip over $1 higher than 2024 strip). Conclusion Mach Natural Resources has made progress in reducing its D&C costs, with its Oswego well costs coming in a few percent lower than its model. It also believes that it can do better than expected with the development of its acquired Paloma assets.  Mach's lease operating costs also appear to be trending better than expected, helped by lower costs with the Paloma assets. The reduced costs (both D&C and operating costs) increase my estimate of Mach's value to $18.75 to $21.35 per unit, which is a $1 increase from before.

3qix3LIuHdIsXtG,Seeking Alpha,bing,CDT Insider Sentiment June 2024: Keep Your Seatbelt Fastened,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702360-cdt-insider-sentiment-june-2024-keep-your-seatbelt-fastened,2024-07-03 22:30,2024-07-03 22:45,NVDA,,"kaarsten/iStock via Getty Images       First Half Update Closing out the first half of 2024, the S&P 500 Total Return Index (which includes dividend reinvestment) is up an incredible +15.3%. For context, since 1988, the average yearly return is +11.75% and the compound annual return is +10.75%, clearly the index is having a stellar six-month performance. Behind the scenes, AI isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt directing the show, it is the show. To underscore just how pervasive the AI movement is in the market today, let√¢¬Ä¬ôs start our commentary by zeroing in on Nvidia (NVDA), the AI poster child and market darling of the moment. According to Apollo asset management, Nvidia accounted for a record-breaking 34.5% of the total return in the S&P 500 as of the middle of June; an absolutely absurd statistic when you consider that there are, as the name suggests, 500 other companies in the index. Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs ascent from obscurity is historic, and the recent milestones of this once less-known name are remarkable. Year-to-date, the stock is up over +150%; this month, the company joined the exclusive $3 trillion market capitalization club; and a couple of weeks ago, the company even briefly stole the title of the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs most valuable company away from Microsoft (MSFT). The whole story is impressive, but even by financial market standards, the euphoria around the chipmaker is, for lack of a better word, unnatural. From a fundamental perspective, Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs earnings growth is equally as impressive as its stock performance (Q1-2025: +629% year-over-year), but the title of the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs most valuable company demands something more. To compete against the likes of Microsoft and Apple (AAPL) for the title, Nvidia has to prove the durability of its earnings, but also attain qualifications that can only come with time like an unquestioned level of maturity and pristine track record of execution. At 1.5x the size of the entire German stock market, the company has a lot to prove. For now, granting the chipmaker the title of world√¢¬Ä¬ôs most valuable company seems presumptuous. The situation is reminiscent of Michael Jordan being invited to play baseball for the White Sox - he was talented, but did he have what it takes to succeed in the big leagues? Let√¢¬Ä¬ôs talk about the rest of the market, and by √¢¬Ä¬úthe rest of the market,√¢¬Ä¬ù I mean Microsoft, Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (Facebook) (META), Alphabet (Google) (GOOG) (GOOGL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), Eli Lilly (LLY), Broadcom (AVGO) and JPMorgan (JPM). Why these names out of a 500-company index? Well, because collectively, they now represent over 35% of the index weighting - again, another eerie record broken. The market has never in history been more concentrated in just a handful of names. Ten years ago, the top 10, companies represented just 14% of the index, and for more context, if the S&P 500 was equal-weighted, then all ten companies would be just 2% of the index. We believe that there are two distinct dynamics at play driving this concentration to record-breaking levels. The first we talked about already, AI. The promise of structural growth in AI is driving speculative appetites for anything and all things related to the topic, hence the big jump in Nvidia shares as well as the other mega-cap tech names in the top ten like Apple. The second is a bit more nuanced. Today, we are likely in a recession or something that looks a heck of a lot like a recession. The indicators below are just a handful of data points that are down from their previous reading or missed analyst expectations.   The cyclical decline in the economy will impact the earnings of industries of all sizes, from Apple to your local barbershop. However, √¢¬Ä¬úmega-cap tech,√¢¬Ä¬ù which is well represented in the S&P 500 top 10 is often wrongly regarded as a defensive position in the face of economic slowdowns. Under the guise of √¢¬Ä¬úhigh-quality√¢¬Ä¬ù √¢¬Ä¬ì √¢¬Ä¬úhigh quality businesses√¢¬Ä¬ù √¢¬Ä¬ì √¢¬Ä¬úhigh quality balance sheets√¢¬Ä¬ù and perceptions of forever earnings growth, market pundits notoriously recommend tech as a safe haven from the business cycle, but almost never talk about price. We wholeheartedly disagree with the thought. First, all businesses are cyclical, and the only question is the level of sensitivity to the cycle. For reference, look no further than 2022. A modest ad market slowdown roiled the most beloved names during the 2020-2021 covid rally:     Then, as now, leading up to the beginning of 2022, pundits labeled these stocks as √¢¬Ä¬údefensive√¢¬Ä¬ù - they turned out to be anything but. No one doubts that these companies are wonderful businesses, but those who recommended them seemingly failed to consider the price paid for √¢¬Ä¬úhigh quality.√¢¬Ä¬ù In this instance, and in most instances for that matter, paying for high-quality growth at any price is like getting insurance for your home that covers just half its value; you better hope that the next hurricane misses your neighborhood! But in the meantime, as the market searches for save heavens, mega caps will provide a false sense of protection, which will fan valuations ever higher - that is until they don√¢¬Ä¬ôt. Today, according to our estimate of normal earnings growth, the market trades 1 standard deviation away from its average P/E and is getting more expensive by the day. At this valuation, this top-heavy market is not even considering the business cycle as a possibility of risk.     The real rest of the market, represented by the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), the Russell 2000 (IWM) and the equal-weighted S&P 500 (RSP) have fared far worse than their meg-cap tech-driven S&P 500 counterpart (^SP500TR). We feel that the relative underperformance of these indices is indicative of the rest of the market discounting the increasing likelihood of recession and the future impact on their respective earnings. Meanwhile, mega caps fueled by AI and 'high quality' rhetoric have not yet reflected these developments.     Quick Digression: In real-time, to underscore the dichotomy in the market between mega-cap names and their smaller counterparts, Tesla (TSLA) just reported sales production for Q2 and the numbers were down -5% on a year-over-year basis but were slightly better than analyst estimates. The result is the stock is up approximately +10% or roughly $73B in market capitalization terms. On what is ostensibly a net negative piece of information, the market capitalization of the stock in a single day increased by more than the entire market capitalization of its competitor, General Motors (GM) by a long shot, which is utterly irrational. As serendipity would have it, GM also reported sales volume numbers this morning that were also ahead of estimates and for added color, were the best numbers since 2020. As a result, the market has rewarded GM with a flat stock price. This story should highlight the degree of silliness that is currently gripping the market.     Emphasis: The one-day rate of change in Tesla stock price is more than the entire market capitalization of GM √¢¬Ä¬ì absurd! Disclosure: We currently hold a position in General Motors. Above the Clouds Okay, so let us take stock. The AI craze, particularly Nvidia, is in the driver seat of a highly concentrated and expensive stock market. Economic indicators have gone from healthy to deeply red. Gambling behavior is once again gripping the market, as evidenced by the TSLA digression we talked about earlier, but we also note that at the beginning of May, meme stocks mania made a comeback like it was 2021. It is time to raise cash. Individually, any one of these issues could be cause for a market sell off. The concentration story that played out in 2020-2021 led to dismal results in 2022 and prior to that, the last time the market was so narrowly held was the dotcom bubble. Further, according to RBC Capital Markets, the stock market has on average lost -32% peak-to-trough during drawdowns caused by recessions since 1937 and while, we are not in a recession today, the probability of one has certainly increased. Lastly, all manias without exception lead to a future hangover. As a hedge fund, underwriting risk is part of our DNA. Our quantitative framework is what we leverage to draw up our flight path as we traverse all market environments including this peculiar case. Today, we are approximately 10% reserved based on an elevated market valuation, a relatively high risk-free return on cash and a weakening labor market. For all the reasons we have already mentioned, we believe this shift from fully invested to more defensive is prudent. Our reserve would be higher if not for one unusual phenomenon, insider sentiment remains above normal trends. That may seem awkward given all the caution we have expressed in our note, but if you double-click on it, we believe it makes a lot of sense. First, let√¢¬Ä¬ôs talk about what we are not seeing, we are not seeing mega-cap tech insiders actively purchasing their shares. In fact, the opposite is true, we are frequently reading in the media that top executives at these companies are selling. While we do not believe that to be a reliable signal for gauging insider sentiment, it logically is at best a neutral indication and at worst, a warning. Additionally, given that AI is consuming all the air in the market, it makes sense that insiders from other parts of the market that have not yet received their fair share of attention are buying their respective equities on the back of stagnant or depressed valuations, which is elevating insider sentiment outside of mega caps. For us, as we have mentioned before and will reiterate again, where we do see activity is in three primary industries: utilities, healthcare, and banking. All three of which we would consider resilient cash flowing business models that are currently trading at very attractive valuations in relation to their respective secular growth trends. Below, we outlined our portfolio companies in each industry category and provided some quick-take bullet points on the prospects of each industry.     Together these companies represent approximately 3/4th of the net asset value of our stock portfolio. That is not to say that during the first half of 2024, we have not seen activity in other parts of the market, we have. Cybersecurity, enterprise SaaS, liquified natural gas and auto part retailers are just some of the areas of the market that we observed extraordinary activity and taken a position; that is if we did not have one already. While other companies with observed insider activity such as Zillow (Z), Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Nike (NKE) and Disney (DIS), to name a few, simply did not pass our definition of extraordinary insider activity or meet our fundamental criteria. We look forward to updating you again in August. How it Works Objective: Predictive model that measures the historical relationship between insider sentiment and the future probability of downside volatility (risk) Insider Trading Activity: Purchase activity of an insider√¢¬Ä¬ôs own stock filtered by proprietary parameters to scrub noisy data Insight: Executive-level insider sentiment is an indicator of near-term financial market risk - Low executive sentiment suggests a high level of risk - High executive sentiment suggests a low level of risk Scale: A ratio of current insider trading activity in relation to historical patterns - (0 to √¢¬à¬û) with a historical median measure of 1 - Below 1 implies an above normal level of risk - Above 1 implies a below normal level of risk Frequency: The measure is updated daily and has historically been subject swift and possibly extreme shifts *This webpage is updated monthly and provides just a snapshot of the most recent month-end Disclosures This presentation does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other AI stories.Are Growing Patents in AI from China a Threat to the US?China and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.The United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.OpenAI & Anthropic: A Comparative AnalysisWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.Story continuesOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.In another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.Anthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.Claude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.A lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Adobe, the creative giant, has been disrupting the generative AI industry. The company's AI tools allow users to add and remove images, generate high-quality images, create personalized content, and automate workflows. Some of the major products include Adobe Firefly, Adobe Express, Acrobat AI Assistant, and Adobe GenStudio.The company's roadmap to becoming an AI creative giant is fierce. On June 27, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) announced that its Adobe Content Hub is now generally available with the Adobe Experience Manager. The Adobe Experience Manager is a digital asset management system home to an entire database of images and videos, used by many Fortune 50 companies. The Adobe Content Hub, on the other hand, is transforming the content creation process and its usage, by providing users with every brand-approved asset at their fingertips. The hub is integrated with Adobe Express and Adobe Firefly, the company's leading all-in-one design and generative AI tools.Adobe's AI products are highly popular in the market. Adobe Firefly has been used to generate more than 9 billion images since March 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, the company's document cloud segment logged $782 million in revenue, up 19% year-over-year.¬† Overall, the company expects its generative AI tools and products to gain momentum in the third and fourth quarters of 2024.At the close of Q1 2024, 108 investors were bullish on the stock, with total stakes amounting to $9.03 billion. Of those, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $2.28 billion.On June 17, Bernstein maintained an outperform rating on the stock and raised its price target from $653 to $660. Overall, the stock has a median price forecast of $625 based on price targets of 45 analysts. This represents an upside of 10% from its current price of $570.15.Here are some comments about Adobe from Fred Alger Management's Q1 2024 investor letter:""Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a diversified software company that provides document and creative software to a wide audience, including creative professionals and enterprises. Its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Acrobat, and Creative Suite, set industry standards like PDF and Flash, supporting a broad range of Adobe applications. As such, we believe Adobe is a primary beneficiary of the digitization (i.e., converting analog information into digital format) spending theme. Recently, the company announced a generative Al (Gen Al) tool called Firefly which is a family of creative GenAl models which will be incorporated into Adobe‚Äôs product suite, which can be utilized by consumers and enterprises to potentially save time and effort by automating tasks like image and text generation. We believe Adobe has the potential to leverage Al by integrating software programs into its existing products and enhancing developer Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to facilitate Al-driven workflows. While the company delivered strong fiscal first quarter operating results, shares detracted from performance after management lowered their fiscal second quarter guidance with Al related growth acceleration being pushed out into the second half of 2024 due to difficult year-over-year pricing comparison. particularly within their creative vertical segment.""Overall ADBE ranks 9th on our list of the biggest AI stories right now.

South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.The United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.OpenAI & Anthropic: A Comparative AnalysisWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.Story continuesOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.In another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.Anthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.Claude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.A lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).A customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers.Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 154Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is a prominent AI story and a leading cloud provider, contributing to its ranking on our list. The cloud provider is on its way to becoming an AI powerhouse. The company's AI cloud platform can support any large language model and is built on the Einstein GPT Trust Layer. Key AI products by the company include Sales AI, Customer Service AI, Marketing AI, and Commerce AI. In a recent development, MuleSoft, Salesforce's software company that provides integration software to connect data and applications, launched AsyncAPI which is capable of building AI-powered customer experiences in real-time. The launch will facilitate the widespread adoption of event-driven architectures, allowing businesses to respond to real-time events faster.Overall, the company is now responsible for 250 petabytes of data for its customers, crucial to the AI transition. The company's Data Cloud is rapidly growing to become its next $1 billion cloud. Data Cloud streamlines AI insights and actions for its customers. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) claims that this is its first step to becoming an AI enterprise and is expecting a major tailwind in revenue due to AI adoption.Overall, at the close of Q1 2024, 154 investors were bullish on the stock, with total stakes amounting to $16.62 billion. Of those, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $3.27 billion.CRM is a Wall Street favorite. Its median price forecast represents an upside of 15% from current levels.Here are some comments about Salesforce from Harding Loevner's Q1 2024 investor letter:""Leading software companies have the advantage of high switching costs and the ability to incorporate new features into products customers already use. For example, Microsoft has added its Copilot chatbot functionality to everything from search (Bing Chat, recently renamed to just Copilot) to coding (GitHub Copilot) and workplace applications (Copilot for Microsoft 365). Software sold by Microsoft and other companies such as Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), SAP, and ServiceNow are also already deeply integrated into their customers‚Äô operations and workflow.As large enterprises search for the right balance, Salesforce‚Äôs Data Cloud, a flagship offering, is designed to address a critical issue for them so they can make better use of AI tools. After a hectic buildout over the last few years of ‚Äúdata warehouses‚Äù and ‚Äúdata lakes‚Äù‚Äîtwo types of repositories for storing and processing data‚Äîacross the various business units of large companies, many companies are left with what feels like islands of trapped data. Data Cloud solves this by creating a single platform to access and leverage all of an enterprise‚Äôs data, eliminating the need to constantly duplicate large amounts of information across different platforms. Users are then able to apply generative-AI technology, such as Salesforce‚Äôs Einstein tool, to a more comprehensive dataset, which enables them to better glean customers‚Äô intentions, personalize marketing messages, and automate the processing of customer-service requests. As users build these systems, Einstein‚Äôs copiloting functionality helps their programmers work more efficiently so that IT departments with limited budgets and manpower can still develop the necessary tools. Salesforce‚Äôs management projects that revenue and earnings will climb about 9% and 45%, respectively, in fiscal 2025, citing the company‚Äôs operating leverage and cost discipline. We think these figures are achievable given the renewed focus on profitable growth, and so we added to the stock during the quarter.""Overall CRM ranks 6th on our list of the biggest AI stories right now.

The company is pioneering AI software and hardware products. The company's Advanced AI platform for Enterprise improves productivity, streamlines AI workflows, and ensures faster deployment and processing of AI. Earlier this year, the company introduced its Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU), backed by six different technologies in data processing, design automation, drug design, quantum computing, and generative AI.Overall, the company logged $22.6 billion in data center revenue, up 23% from the previous quarter and 427% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU Computing platform. Compute revenue grew by 5x and networking revenue expanded by 3x compared to the previous year. The Hopper GPU is one of the world's first accelerated computing platforms, built with over 80 billion transistors. Nvidia's advancements in AI are accelerating at a rapid pace. On June 19, the company launched the NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, a set of microservices that enable the development of autonomous machines using AI.Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and Chief Analyst Patrick Moorhead, recently talked about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in an interview on Yahoo Finance. He positions Nvidia as the primary provider of AI infrastructure systems. He compares Nvidia's position to Cisco, the driver of infrastructure from the internet age in the early 2000s. Moorhead highlights that the company's dominant position is backed by sustained enterprise demand, and he sees nothing changing in the next six to nine months. However, he suggests that to maintain its dominance, Nvidia needs to emphasize growth in enterprise.At the close of Q1 2024, 186 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $48.3 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the highest stakeholder with a position of $18.74 billion.On July 1, Morgan Stanley maintained an overweight rating on the stock and raised its price target from $116 to $144.Here are some comments about Nvidia from the Meridian Funds Q1 2024 investor letter:""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system-on-a-chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. The company has experienced strong performance recently due to booming demand for its data center products, particularly those related to artificial intelligence. A major driver of Nvidia‚Äôs recent success has been the growing adoption of its GPU accelerators for AI training and inference across various end markets. The company‚Äôs GPUs have become an industry standard for training large language models (LLMs), and its networking solutions, such as NVLink and InfiniBand, are critical to maximizing the performance of AI systems. Nvidia‚Äôs latest Blackwell GPU platform is expected to further extend its lead in the AI accelerator market, with significant performance and total cost of ownership benefits over its predecessors. As the AI market continues to expand with growing adoption across enterprises and sovereign nations, we expect Nvidia to maintain its dominance and experience sustained growth in its data center business. Beyond data centers, Nvidia has also benefited from strong demand in its gaming business, which has recovered after a period of inventory digestion in 2022. The company‚Äôs gaming GPUs have been well-received, and its focus on the high-end market has supported growth in average selling prices. Looking ahead, we expect the gaming market to remain healthy with ongoing growth potential. Nvidia also sees opportunities to diversify its business and foray into new markets, such as automotive and robotics. We continued to hold our position in Nvidia.""Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the biggest AI stories right now.

As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.Anthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.Claude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.A lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter‚Äôs strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 246Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) moves in AI contribute to its ranking as the third biggest AI story on our list. Meta AI, built on Llama 3, is one of the most advanced AI models developed by the company. Meta AI is capable of complex reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding instructions. Like Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is also advancing its AI infrastructure capabilities. In April, the company introduced its next generation of custom chips to manage its AI workloads. The new chips will significantly enhance the company's recommendation ads model on Facebook and Instagram. 30% of posts on Facebook and 50% of content on Instagram are delivered by the company's AI recommendation system. The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) v1 is the company's first inference accelerator designed in-house, capable of handling high-complexity and low-complexity ranking and recommendation models. The company expects expenditure on AI to expand. As per a recent update, the company looks forward to increasing its capital expenditure from $35 billion to $40 billion, driven by large investments in AI, in 2024.Meta's growth in producing responsible AI models can be attributed to its strong research capabilities. On June 18, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) launched new AI research models to boost innovation at a much larger scale than before. The company released five new models including image-to-text and text-to-music generation models, a prediction model, and a model that detects AI-generated speech. Meta Chameleon is a family of mixed-modal models capable of understanding, processing, and delivering both text and words at the same time. The AI can take any input of text and words to output any combination of text and words required. To replace standard text and idea generation, the company proposed a multi-token prediction approach that would make large language models significantly more efficient. This approach trains models to predict a variety of future words instantly, replacing the common one-at-a-time approach.Justin Patterson, Keybanc's managing director, recently talked about Meta's position in the market in an interview on Yahoo Finance. He raised his price target from $475 to $540 amid Meta's strong advertising growth. Patterson pointed out that Meta's ad revenue is increasing every quarter which is a reflection of strong demand and he is optimistic about returns from the AI advertising cycle. Overall, Patterson has noticed stronger engagement across all of Meta's platforms due to AI investments and improvements in its ad models.META was held by 246 hedge funds at the close of Q1 2024, with total stakes amounting to $46.92 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the highest stakeholder with a position of $7.07 billion.On July 3, Loop Capital reiterated a buy rating on the stock and maintained its price target of $550. Based on price targets from 67 analysts, META's median price forecast of $530 represents an upside of almost 4% from its current price of $509.65.Overall META ranks 3rd¬†on our list of the biggest AI stories right now. You can visit 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week¬†to see the other AI stories that are on hedge funds‚Äô radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

They specialize in two main services: Backblaze Computer Backup, offering service to computer data backup for desktops and laptops, and Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage, which is an on-demand object storage solution for developers and businesses. BLZE's is considered to have large pricing advantage over its competitors, especially for its data storage service. BLZE's B2 costs $6 per TB/month. AWS costs $26 per TB/month, Microsoft Azure charges $20 per TB/month, and Google charges $23 per TB/month. While Dropbox, a larger player, offers a different service, their annual Dropbox Plus plan translates to $9.99/month compared to BLZE's annualized price of just $8.25/month. Despite its IPO in 2021, BLZE has yet to turn a profit, and its stock price has experienced a significant decline of over 80%. However, for brave investors, now maybe the time to dip a toe into BLZE. First, the surge in AI -induced investment is lifting data storage companies, including BLZE Nearly every cloud-based data storage company enjoyed a strong revenue growth in recent quarters. In the first quarter of 2024 ended in March 2024, Amazon's AWS achieved a 17% year-over-year revenue growth rate, Microsoft Azure experienced a 21% year-over-year revenue growth, and Google Cloud reported a 28% year-over-year revenue growth. BLZE's cloud storage revenue growth during the same period was 47%. The revenue growth in the second quarter in 2024 appears to be similarly strong. One of the top producers of computer memory and computer data storage, Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) just reported their earning results for the quarter ended in May 2024. Their year-to-year data center revenue growth was 50%, driven by the strong AI demand. As a side note, while MU's YTD stock price growth rate was around 60 percent, BLZE's YTD stock price growth was negative 17 percent. Second, BLZE Shows Signs of Progress on Profitability While still unprofitable, BLZE has worked hard in cost control, offering a glimmer of hope for future profitability. In 2022 and 2023, BLZE's operating expenses alone exceeded its gross revenue. In the first quarter of 2024, the ratio of operating expense to gross revenue finally fell below 100 percent. SEC filing BLZE's operating margin and net profit margin told a similar story. In 2022 and 2023, its operating margin and net profit margin declined to the negative 50%-60% range. In the first quarter of 2024, its operating margin and net profit margin recovered to the negative 30%-40% range. Although this is not a sharp turn-around, it demonstrates progress in cost control efforts. SEC filing During the last earning call, the management was asked about if BLZE was making investment on developing any AI-focused solution for customers. The management responded that BLZE served as a foundational data platform, but they did not make investments to develop any specific AI product. I considered this exchange as positive for BLZE since developing AI products is really expensive today when the cost of talents and chips are highly elevated. Not making such investments is actually a smart decision. Furthermore, BLZE's competitors such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are all big players with significant resources and large AI talent pool. If BLZE were to develop any new AI product, it probably could not come close to their competitors' offerings. Thus, BLZE focusing on its advantage: providing a cheap data storage solution is a better approach to grow their company. Third, valuation is relatively attractive Since Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are much more than a simple cloud storage provider, it is more appropriate to compare BLZE with a bigger cloud storage provider, Dropbox (DBX). DBX is profitable, but its revenue growth was much slower, which was 3.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024. Right now, DBX is price/sales (P/S) ratio is around 3.1, while BLZE's P/S ratio is around 2.1 with a much faster revenue growth rate. BLZE's P/S ratio is also near its historical lows, making it potentially attractive. Risk Factors The main risk is that BLZE fails to maintain cost control efforts, which is crucial for BLZE to achieve profitability. Another risk is that the AI demand for data storage is not sustainable and fades over time. Conclusion  AI demand for data storage will continue driving the strong revenue growth at BLZE. The cost control effort is likely to turn BLZE profitable in the near future.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of tiragolumab plus Tecentriq and chemotherapy showed reduced efficacy in both PFS and OS compared to the comparator arm in the intent-to-treat population, which includes the phase II and phase III cohorts. The overall safety profile remains consistent with the safety profile previously observed for the combination of tiragolumab plus Tecentriq and chemotherapy, and no new or unexpected findings were identified. Based on these results, patients and investigators will be unblinded and we intend to halt the study. A communication will be sent to the investigators and results will be shared with health authorities and subsequently presented at an upcoming medical meeting.‚ÄúThese results are disappointing as it was our hope that this combination might yield improved outcomes for people living with metastatic non-squamous lung cancer,‚Äù said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. ‚ÄúWe are thankful to all of the patients and healthcare professionals involved in the study, and we will leverage the learnings to inform our scientific understanding of the anti-TIGIT pathway and new avenues in cancer research.‚ÄùADVERTISEMENTOngoing phase III studies are investigating treatment settings and indications distinct from SKYSCRAPER-06. Based on today‚Äôs results, we will evaluate any relevant changes needed to the ongoing tiragolumab programme.About SKYSCRAPER-06 studySKYSCRAPER-06 is a global phase II/III, randomised, placebo-controlled and double-blinded study evaluating tiragolumab plus Tecentriq¬Æ (atezolizumab) and chemotherapy as an initial (first-line) treatment versus pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in 542 people with non-squamous non- small cell lung cancer. Primary endpoints are overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).About tiragolumabTiragolumab is an investigational novel immune checkpoint inhibitor with an intact Fc region. Tiragolumab selectively binds to TIGIT, a novel inhibitory immune checkpoint which suppresses the immune response to cancer. Based on preclinical research, tiragolumab is thought to work as an immune amplifier with other cancer immunotherapies such as Tecentriq¬Æ (atezolizumab). The TIGIT pathway is distinct but complementary to the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway. Dual blockade with tiragolumab and Tecentriq may help overcome immune suppression and restore the immune response.About Tecentriq¬Æ (atezolizumab)Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy approved for some of the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat forms of cancer. Tecentriq was the first cancer immunotherapy approved for the treatment of a certain type of early-stage (adjuvant) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tecentriq is also approved in countries around the world, either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and/or chemotherapies, for various forms of metastatic NSCLC, certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC), PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS).Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody designed to bind with a protein called programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, blocking its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. By inhibiting PD-L1, Tecentriq may enable the activation of T-cells. Tecentriq is a cancer immunotherapy that has the potential to be used as a foundational combination partner with other immunotherapies, targeted therapies and various chemotherapies across a broad range of cancers.In addition to intravenous infusion, Tecentriq has been approved as a subcutaneous formulation in over 40 countries. The approved indications for Tecentriq SC mirror those of Tecentriq IV.About Roche Founded in 1896 in Basel, Switzerland, as one of the first industrial manufacturers of branded medicines, Roche has grown into the world‚Äôs largest biotechnology company and the global leader in in-vitro diagnostics.

It comes after the company's stock market value hit a record high on Wednesday. In February, he announced that he would sell Amazon shares worth around $8.5bn. That marked the first time since 2021 that Mr Bezos had sold Amazon shares. The company's shares have risen by more than 30% this year on expectations that growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology will boost earnings at its cloud computing business. Last month, Amazon's stock market valuation topped the $2tn for the first time. However, that is still behind other major technology firms Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft, all of which have crossed the $3tn mark. Amazon reported robust quarterly earnings at the end of the April, that showed the company's bet on AI was paying off. Mr Bezos stepped down as the company's chief executive in 2021 and is currently its executive chair and remains its largest shareholder. He founded Amazon in 1994 in a garage in Bellevue, Washington, when the internet was still in its infancy. The company started out as an online bookseller, touting the world's largest collection of ebooks. Since then Amazon has become one of the world's leading online retail and cloud computing companies. He also founded the rocket company Blue Origin, which in May sent six customers to the edge of space. Mr Bezos is the world's second richest person, according to the Forbes Billionaires list, with an estimated net worth of around $214bn. Copyright 2024 BBC.

LPOqmZaJU2na7Dr,Seeking Alpha,google,Intel Stock: Between A Rock (NVIDIA) And A Hard Place (AMD) (NASDAQ:INTC),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702377-intel-between-a-rock-nvidia-and-a-hard-place-amd?source=section_asset:related-analysis%7Csection:right_rail%7Cfirst_level_url:article%7Cline:1%7Cpos:undefined,2024-07-04 01:50,2024-07-04 01:54,INTC,,"Gary Landry Jr/iStock via Getty Images Thesis Summary Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) continues to disappoint and underperform, while stubborn analysts (myself included) keep waiting for the Intel turnaround. Intel has had the misfortune of being outplayed by two different competitors in two distinct segments. I'm talking of course of NVIDIA (NVDA) in the GPU market, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in the CPU market. Trapped between a rock and a hard place, Intel has chosen to change the paradigm, by refocusing its efforts into chip manufacturing. In my last Intel article, I delved into its Foundry aspirations and compared it to TSMC. I concluded that given the growing geopolitical uncertainty, Intel could become a ""national champion"", which supported buying the stock. In today's article, I will discuss why Intel's price has not appreciated over the last 10 years, and what we can expect over the next 10, by quantifying and qualifying Intel's latest efforts in the fab and AI segments. We will estimate Intel's revenues as far out as 2030. I maintain a buy rating given the growth catalysts ahead and the reasonable margin of safety. The Lost Decade Intel is a huge company and a household name, but more than that is needed to actually deliver returns to investors. INTC Price (SA) Over the last 10 years, the stock has essentially not moved, although to be fair, Intel has paid out a pretty steady dividend over the last 10 years. The dethroning of Intel was made official last year, when NVIDIA actually surpassed the company in yearly revenues. Intel vs NVDA Revenues (X) NVIDIA finished its fiscal 2024 year (January 30th, 2023 to January 28th, 2024) with $60.9 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, Intel procured $54.2 billion in 2023. Intel's revenues actually fell 14% YoY, while NVIDIA's revenues more than doubled. How can this be when both companies are part of the semiconductor industry? Intel Gets Squeezed Intel has been in the chip business for quite some time and has a wide array of products. But, perhaps, it was this ""diversification"" that sealed its fate. While Intel does make GPUs and has accelerated their development in the last two years, the company has always had a stronger foothold on CPUs. However, the AI revolution has made GPUs, rather than CPUs a much more valuable component of the process. This allowed NVIDIA to step in with its A100, and then its H100 and take the market by storm. New data centers are much more GPU-heavy than their predecessors, and these chips are much more expensive than the CPUs, which means that most expenditure has gone towards GPUs in the last few years. In a world of GPUs Intel was still relying on its CPUs to obtain most of its data center revenue, and on this front, Intel was also losing the battle. 2023 was also the year when AMD's CPU market share reached a new high compared to Intel. The chip designer's CPU share grew a half point to 31.1 percent in 2023 while Intel's decreased as much to 68.9 percent when counting total CPU shipments between both companies last year, according to CPU-tracking firm Mercury Research. Source: CRN.com Intel has no doubt fallen behind, squeezed out of the market by two companies that were hungrier and just doing things better. So what's the road up ahead for Intel? Here are the main options:  Compete head-to-head with NVIDIA Specialize itself within the AI market Grow the Foundry business  Let's dive deeper into each of these, and try to quantify what Intel can do over the next 10 years. Fab Transition and AI Redemption Intel can try to compete with NVIDIA. Perhaps it won't be able to develop superior tech, but it could develop similarly efficient technology that is better priced. In this regard, Intel is planning to begin selling the Gaudi 3 as soon as they possibly can. These have been developed in great part thanks to the acquisition of Habana Labs in 2019. Intel has reported a $2 billion sales pipeline, but this is still a measly figure compared to what NVIDIA is pulling from data centers. However, it's a start, and it will be a first step in showing that NVIDIA is not the only option out there. In my opinion, Intel stands to challenge NVIDIA if it makes the right moves (acquisitions) and differentiates itself from NVIDIA, perhaps by offering lower-priced chips. Intel is also making a big bet on AI PCs, an area in which it does have some past experience. Intel's latest Core Ultra Processors will reportedly have a Neural Processing Unit, NPU, to complement the CPU and GPU part of the PC. But the company will again face stiff competition here from AMD, mainly, but also the likes of Qualcomm (QCOM), Apple (AAPL) and NVIDIA itself. Lastly, and perhaps most notably, Intel has decided to change the paradigm completely by making a big investment in its new Foundry business. By 2030, Intel expects it could become the second largest Foundry in the world While this move has been criticized by some, it makes a lot of sense in my opinion. The move allows Intel to:  Benefit from AI demand through a less crowded market. Achieve vertical integration. Set itself up as a ""national champion"", which I discuss in-depth in my last article.  So, with that said, let's put the theory into practice and crunch some numbers: Forecast and Valuation Let's begin by crunching some numbers. Data Center Market Share (10Qs) As of Q3 2023, Intel had around 19.1% market share in the Data Center Market, after losing significant ground to NVIDIA and also AMD. UD Data Center forecast (Grand View Research) The Data Center market is projected to grow at a 10.7% CAGR in the next 8 years, reaching close to a $440 billion market cap. Intel made $15.2 billion from Data Centers last year. Assuming it can grow these revenues at 10% over the next 7 years, until 2030, that would put Intel's Data Center revenues at just over $30 billion. This seems realistic, given the fact that Intel has already made big efforts to recover market share. Intel was caught off guard, but now it has a clear direction. Canalys is projecting AI PC shipments to rise at a 44% CAGR from 2024 to 2028, from an estimated 48 million PCs this year, before doubling to more than 100 million in 2025 and rising to over 205 million by 2028. Source: Forbes According to the research above, AI PCs shipments could grow at a 44% CAGR until 2028. To be safe, let's assume a 40% CAGR until 2030. Meanwhile, the overall PC market is projected to grow at around 9.10%. Intel's Client Computing, which is where PC revenues are included, generated $29.26 billion in 2023. Let's say Intel can actually become a strong presence in PCs, and achieve a growth of 15%. That would put revenues at $78 billion by 2030. And lastly, let's take Intel at face value, and say they can fulfill their $15 billion foundry revenue estimates. Intel Foundry revenue forecast (Investor slides) This adds up to $123 billion in revenues by 2030, implying that the company's revenues could be more than double, growing at a CAGR of 12%. Revenue estimates (SA) It's definitely on the optimistic side. Analysts would put Intel at around $90 billion by 2029. Maybe closer to $100 billion by 2030. Still, this is not very far off from estimates, and I don't think we have made outlandish claims given the forecasts for the different segments Intel's involved in. At today's PS of 2.3, that would mean Intel's market cap could be close to $260 billion, and the price would be at least double what it is today, not even accounting for multiple expansion. Final Thoughts  All in all, Intel has plenty of potential ahead, while most of the downside seems to have been realized. This may not deliver crazy returns, but it is a very solid value investment, pays a decent dividend and has numerous growth catalysts ahead.

aW0ZblSL80bes3x,Seeking Alpha,bing,TMFC: A Few Advantages Over QQQ Come With Burdensome Expenses,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702371-tmfc-a-few-advantages-over-qqq-come-with-burdensome-expenses,2024-07-04 02:00,2024-07-04 02:12,NVDA,,"lerbank/iStock via Getty Images After a pause in the coverage of the Motley Fool 100 Index ETF (BATS:TMFC) that I have taken since February 2023, today I would like to reassess this vehicle owing mostly to the fact that it has solidly surprised on the upside, welcoming a hypothesis that my skepticism on the name that all my articles since January 2022 were expressing should be abandoned.   Seeking Alpha What is TMFC? As described in the factsheet available on its website, the ETF oversees a portfolio ...of the 100 largest, most liquid U.S. companies that have been recommended by The Motley Fool, LLC√¢¬Ä¬ôs analysts√¢¬Ä¬îeither in the Fool Intel database or The Motley Fool√¢¬Ä¬ôs research publications. It is true that this Motley Fool ETF has been performing outstandingly, as its IT-focused portfolio with meaningful exposure to AI beneficiaries has been on a tear both in 2023 and 2024. However, this is not sufficient for a rating upgrade, as my concerns have not gone anywhere. The problem is that TMFC is a product capable of outcompeting the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) but not the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ) or a similar growth-centered play like the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG). Most importantly, QQQ is much cheaper, with an expense ratio of 20 bps compared to TMFC's 50 bps. SCHG has a wafer-thin expense ratio of 4 bps, and it bested TMFC by 12 bps in the annualized return over February 2018√¢¬Ä¬ìJune 2024. So today, I would like to once again thoroughly review strong and weak spots in TMFC's performance track record, as well as compare its factor mix to that of QQQ to explain why the Hold rating suits this vehicle best. TMFC strategy recap As described in the factsheet, TMFC is based on the Motley Fool 100 index.

TMFC performance: beats the market, lags QQQ TMFC has been on a tear this year, as the AI euphoria and the potential interest rate cuts investors have been pricing in have supercharged the rally. It has beaten QQQ (a task that was fairly complicated for it in the past) and IVV. Data by YCharts But what about its longer-term performance? As I would like to put it, TMFC is flourishing during bull markets and suffering during protracted sell-offs. The annualized return and the maximum drawdown reflect that.

The period is February 2018√¢¬Ä¬ìJune 2024 But at the end of the day, while capturing a lot of the market's downside (a bit less than QQQ though) and delivering a steep maximum drawdown, TMFC was incapable of outpacing QQQ or SCHG. And this is an issue, assuming both funds are more liquid and have much more comfortable expense ratios, which will be a tailwind for the total returns over the long term. Seeking Alpha TMFC vs. QQQ: a factor mix perspective As of July 2, TMFC had 100 equities in its portfolio, with the overlap with its version that I discussed in the February 2023 article being around 94.8%, which indicates that both additions and deletions were minor. For example, TMFC has added Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), which is now accounting for 3.7% of the portfolio, and deleted Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which had a 2.4% weight. Compared to QQQ, it is underweight in the GICS IT sector and consumer staples and overweight in financials and health care, among others. It ignores utilities entirely.   Created by the author using data from the funds I would argue that, from a factor standpoint, the current iteration of the TMFC portfolio has an edge over QQQ. With 68% of TMFC's net assets allocated to the constituents of the NASDAQ-100, as per my calculations, this vehicle's portfolio is slightly better valued (there are nuances worth addressing), with a bit larger growth factor exposure as well as a bit stronger quality. Let us start with the value factor. Value Both are very much about the trillion-dollar league, with QQQ having a 40.6% allocation to these companies and TMFC having 44.2%. However, the latter has managed to deliver a bit stronger weighted-average adjusted earnings yield (negative figures were removed), 2.91% vs. QQQ's 2.79%, as per my calculations. While P/E and, consequently, the EY are frequently used as essential valuation gauges, they are nevertheless certainly not the only and clearly not the most reliable metrics. A nice suggestion is to use EBITDA/Enterprise Value, which has an edge over the P/E ratio since it does not ignore debt. Here, TMFC is again marginally ahead, with the EBITDA/EV at 2.87% vs. QQQ's 2.7%, in part thanks to the contribution from 3M (MMM), which has that figure at 12.2%. MMM is absent in the QQQ portfolio. However, looking at the Price/Sales ratio, TMFC is more expensive this time, with that metric at 11.6x vs. 11x of QQQ, with the culprit being its larger allocation to NVIDIA (NVDA). NVDA has a P/S ratio of 38.4x.   ETF NVDA's weight   TMFC 8.6%   QQQ 7.9%   Click to enlarge Created using data from the ETFs as of July 1 Besides, QQQ has a bit larger exposure to companies with a B- Quant Valuation grade or higher, 4% vs. TMFC's 1.45%. Growth In my previous note, I highlighted the ""growth deceleration trend."" More specifically, I observed that the weighted average forward revenue growth rate had been falling consistently in 2022, declining to as low as 11.2% in February 2023. Thankfully, this is no longer an issue. At this juncture, on the growth front, TMFC is clearly ahead of the NASDAQ-100-tracking ETF, with three weighted average forward growth rates being stronger.

But what is not driven by this stock is TMFC's exposure to companies that are forecast to deliver lower revenues or EPS going forward. Here, it looks much better than QQQ.

ROE was adjusted for negative and triple-digit figures Final thoughts  The Motley Fool 100 Index ETF is a growth-heavy product with a tilt toward the IT and communication sectors. It has been a gross success this year as it outperformed IVV and QQQ. So it is clear that the ETF can do the right thing during the bull market, i.e., maintain large exposure to pricey and growthy bellwethers. At the same time, it is clearly incapable of rotating out the riskiest stocks during market downturns similar to the one we were watching in 2022, as it was down by 30.85% for that year. Besides, though it has a slight edge over QQQ regarding growth and quality (its value credentials are less certain), I am skeptical about the decision to choose it over simpler growth-centered vehicles, assuming expense ratio differences. All of this to say, I believe the Hold rating should be reiterated.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

eK6vBV4TzpFGbO2,Seeking Alpha,google,Boeing: How I'm Playing The Potential $4.7 Billion Buyout Deal For Spirit AeroSystems (BA),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702385-boeing-how-im-playing-the-potential-4-7-billion-buyout-deal-for-spirit-aerosystems?source=first_level_url:stock-ideas%7Ccontent_type:all%7Csection:content%7Cline:1,2024-07-04 02:36,2024-07-04 02:43,BA,,"John M. Chase/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images I last wrote about Boeing (NYSE:BA) back in March 2024. At that time, Boeing shares were trading at around $182, and the stock is trading at $185 now. My last article was bullish and I remain bullish. Even though the stock price is essentially right where it was in March, a lot has happened in the past few months and certain events have caused me to change my strategy with this stock. In this article, I want to cover some key developments and as a result, how my investment strategy is changing. The biggest new development is a potential deal for Boeing to buy Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), but there are also a lot of other new developments and updates to make since my last article, so let's get into all of this now: A Potential Buyout Of Spirit AeroSystems Just days ago, news came out about a potential deal for Boeing to Acquire Spirit AeroSystems, which used to be owned by Boeing many years ago. This deal appears to have been in the works for a long time since Boeing sees it as a potential solution to having more oversight and increased safety measures in terms of the structural components like fuselages that Spirit AeroSystems supplies for Boeing and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY). Spirit AeroSystems has been a major source of safety concerns for Boeing especially with the 737. The exact terms of a potential deal have not been announced, but sources suggest that Boeing would be paying about $4.7 billion for Spirit AeroSystems that could value it for $37.25 per share, which is 10% above the current share price. Boeing's potential offer is also said to be made as an all stock deal, so the amount paid could vary and be highly dependent on the final terms as well as the price of Boeing shares when and if any deal closes. With all things being equal, I believe buying shares in Spirit AeroSystems is currently more attractive from a risk/reward point of view than buying Boeing shares. I do think this potential deal has a strong chance of happening, and that it will also be approved by regulators (especially since Boeing owned this company before). So, if I have to choose between buying Boeing shares now for about $185, or buying Spirit AeroSystems, I would take on the risk of a deal failure (which I think is small), and buy Spirit AeroSystems if it is trading for about a 10% discount (or more) to the proposed buyout deal of $37.25. I believe that a discount around that level could continue until the deal gets much closer to closing. In theory, if this deal works out at $37.25, this will in essence give me a chance to buy Boeing shares for a 10% discount to the current share price of $185. A 10% discount in Boeing shares that appears to be potentially available by buying Spirit AeroSystems, is like buying Boeing for just around $166. For this reason, I am willing to accept some risk that comes with deal arbitrage, as it gives me a chance to buy Boeing for a solid discount to the current share price. At any rate, my main point is that there typically is some type of discount on the buyout price for any company until it is close to being finalized, and since I am confident this deal can go through, I think it makes more sense to add to my Boeing position by getting a potential discount on the shares by buying Spirit AeroSystems instead of Boeing directly. Recent Issues At Airbus Show Industry-Wide Challenges There has been some recent news from Airbus which I think is very noteworthy. Just days ago, Airbus announced that it was reducing production guidance for 2024. It now expects to deliver 770 planes instead of previous estimates of approximately 800. The reduced level of production is being caused by a number of factors, but mostly seems to be due to the inability to get supplies from outside sources for things like engines, cabin parts, and structural components. As a result, Airbus lowered its financial forecasts for 2024, and the stock plunged on this news by about 15%. Airbus is based in Toulouse, France and trades on the French stock exchange. As such, some of the recent selloff could be partially due to a correction in the French stock market due to concerns over the snap elections that were recently ordered by President Macron. Just before the snap elections were announced in early June, Airbus was trading for about $42, and it looks like Airbus shares dropped by about 10% (like many French stocks) on this news as it traded down to about $38, and then it rebounded to around $40 per share on June 25th. After the Airbus news on reduced production came out, the stock has dropped further and now trades for about $34, which is well off the 2024 highs of about $46 per share. The chart below shows the story: StockCharts.com With the recent double-whammy of Airbus shares getting knocked down by French election concerns and then the hit from reduced production for 2024, this stock is back down to levels not seen since last year. This significant recent decline in Airbus shares has prompted me to start buying this stock. As I don't want to be overly exposed to the aviation sector, and since this drop makes Airbus shares more compelling to me when compared to Boeing shares, this is changing my plans to keep buying Boeing shares at current levels. However, I do plan to buy Boeing shares if the stock falls from current levels, and I also plan to buy indirectly through the potential Spirit AeroSystems deal. One final point on this Airbus news is that if Airbus is running into previously unexpected and/or larger supply chain issues, I have to think that Boeing could also potentially have underestimated supply chain issues as well. If that is the case, we could see Boeing follow suit with a similar announcement. But there is one thing that might save Boeing, and that is that their own production has been far more curtailed by safety issues already as well as ongoing investigations. So, in this case, Boeing's much slower production might not be impacted in the same way as Airbus. Bad News Continues As Does The Search For A New CEO Another bit of major news has just come out on Boeing and that is a report stating that U.S. prosecutors plan to seek a guilty plea from Boeing over the 737 Max crashes. This could add to the volatility on Boeing shares in the coming days and weeks. A lot could depend on how Boeing plans to deal with this, but it is clear that this company is still not done putting all the bad news behind it. A bit of good news could come from Boeing if it makes a great choice in picking a CEO, since the current CEO has stated he will leave the company at the end of this year. Unfortunately, it seems like very good candidates have not been easy to find. Larry Culp, the CEO of General Electric (GE) has reportedly declined to take the CEO role at Boeing. Mr. Culp is well-regarded for having managed some difficult challenges that GE was facing and he has restored confidence in that company for a lot of investors. I think it is unfortunate that he did not accept the position and that the search for a CEO continues. There is still time for Boeing to bring in a new CEO and if the right candidate is chosen, I believe this will be a potential upside catalyst for the stock. The Chart As shown below, Boeing shares remain well below the highs of around $267 that it held last December. The 50-day moving average is $178.30 and the 200-day moving average is 199.23. This chart continues to show a bearish ""Death Cross"" formation, since the 50-day moving average is well below the 200-day moving average.   StockCharts.com Potential Downside Risks There are numerous potential downside risks when investing in this stock. Of course, there are macro risks for all stocks and that includes a potential recession, a stock market correction, geopolitical issues and more. Specifically to Boeing, I see the potential for new supply chain risks since Airbus seems to have just recently been caught off-guard by this and it could be an issue for Boeing as well. I also think Boeing could be impacted by trade tensions between China and the U.S. Boeing's credibility and continued production issues could be leading more airlines to buy planes from Airbus or seek other solutions. This could impact orders in the future and result in less of a backlog in the years ahead. Another concern I have is that Boeing's balance sheet has suffered in recent years and the company now has $47.94 billion in debt and only $7.53 billion in cash. This type of balance sheet can worry investors, especially if things don't improve soon. One reason I am starting to put more of my money into Airbus now is because that company appears to have fewer issues, and the stock has recently plunged. But I also really like Airbus because of the balance sheet which is much stronger than Boeing's. Airbus has around $14.76 billion in debt and about $17.58 billion in cash. A balance sheet with more cash than debt is the one I will always prefer. I also want to add that buying shares of Spirit AeroSystems has just about all the risks that Boeing has above, plus it has the risk that for some reason, this deal falls through. If that is the case, this stock would likely plunge. For that reason, I would not take a big position in Spirit AeroSystems because deals can fall through for many seemingly small reasons, and the downside could be big. In Summary I still see Boeing as a strong buy, as I expect it to resolve the problems it has sooner or (probably) later. However, this deal for Spirit AeroSystems has created a potential opportunity to do some deal arbitrage whereby it makes more sense for me to buy Spirit AeroSystems due to the discount and arbitrage opportunity that comes with most buyout offers. In addition, I have to say that Airbus shares are looking very attractive in terms of relative value thanks to a big recent drop in the share price. Also, the balance sheet at Airbus looks very attractive, so more of my investment dollars will be going into this company as well. The French elections could keep putting pressure on this stock so, again, I am going to buy in stages and keep my position at a conservative level. No guarantees or representations are made.

RfE4HcQrOM4OME6,Seeking Alpha,bing,VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF May Not Be The Optimal Bitcoin Fund To 'HODL',https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702388-vaneck-bitcoin-trust-etf-may-not-be-the-optimal-bitcoin-fund-to-hodl,2024-07-04 03:21,2024-07-04 03:22,BTC,,"Vitalij Sova VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF (BATS:HODL) is a passive portfolio strategy meant to track the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The portfolio offers retail investors the ability to add BTC holdings to their tax-exempt retirement accounts, which, I believe, has broadened the investor pool for the once decentralized currency. Given the dynamic shift in traders for the cryptocurrency, many of the investment benefits, such as uncorrelated returns, have diminished as a result of by whom and how the assets are held. Given that I am not a BTC trader and view this investment strategy more as an asset allocation, I cannot recommend a price target for trading purposes. Comparing liquidity and AUM with HODL√¢¬Ä¬ôs peer BTC ETF strategy managed by iShares, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), I cannot recommend HODL as a BUY. I recommend HODL with a HOLD rating with a recommended asset allocation of 3-5%. Be sure to review my coverage of IBIT as much of the information presented may overlap: IBIT Is A Great Vehicle For BTC Investing Should You HODL? HODL was one of the many BTC ETFs that entered the market after the much-anticipated SEC approval of bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024. This landmark approval allowed for fund managers to sell managed portfolios of spot BTC, in which the portfolios can buy and hold BTC directly. Approval of these ETFs led to a massive inflow of funds within the first few days of trading, resulting in a massive $4.6b inflow across the various BTC ETFs. Fund flows have since waned but still remain relatively positive, depending on the fund. Considering the chart below, there may have been repositioning into the ETFs as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced massive outflows post-SEC approval. I believe much of the shift was driven by GBTC√¢¬Ä¬ôs total expense ratio of 1.5% when compared to the low cost of competing ETFs. HODL√¢¬Ä¬ôs expense ratio is a mere 20bps, slightly higher than iShares√¢¬Ä¬ôs IBIT at 12bps. TheBlock Specific to HODL, the majority of the funds flowed in mid-March and have remained in relatively low volume transactions, suggesting the ETF is being bought and held as an alternative investment vehicle. TheBlock One of the hazards that came with the launch of these ETFs was the institutionalization of BTC in which BTC is now managed in tandem with other equity and debt instruments. What I mean by this is that BTC now has exposure to cash raises, portfolio rebalances, and other portfolio management strategies that may benefit or harm the direction of the core asset. Though this isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt necessarily a bad thing, this has led to BTC having more correlation with other investment assets that has changed the dynamic of BTC providing uncorrelated returns. Looking at the correlation coefficient with the NASDAQ (QQQ), BTC shows its highest levels of correlation with the index during times of distress. TradingView Comparing HODL to IBIT Given that IBIT and HODL are essentially managed in tandem, I believe comparing both of these ETFs will make do for an investment rationale, with the assumption that the investor is seeking to invest in BTC. At a high level, IBIT does have a higher expense ratio of 12bps compared to HODL√¢¬Ä¬ôs 20bps. This factor will make IBIT more appealing given the lower costs associated with holding the asset, net of returns. IBIT also has a much larger AUM of $18b, overshadowing HODL√¢¬Ä¬ôs AUM of $620mm. I believe liquidity should be a major factor when considering investing in a closed ETF, as shares are traded on the open market as opposed to being redeemed by the investment company. As a result of the AUM, IBIT holds 307k BTC within the portfolio; HODL holds 10k BTC. Net of asset value, IBIT appears to be a much more appealing investment opportunity given the lower expense ratio and higher liquidity. Considering that both ETFs trade in tandem with BTC spot, I believe IBIT should be favored over HODL given the factors listed above. TradingView As a result, I cannot recommend HODL as a BUY given the superior structure offered by IBIT. I recommend HODL with a HOLD recommendation in favor of IBIT. For more information on HODL & IBIT, please visit the VanEck & iShares sites. VanEck HODL iShares IBIT  Again, this is not a recommendation for holding BTC and should not be used for active trading purposes. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the ETF and should only be used for asset allocation purposes.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, I will update this and see where the company seems likely to go from here going forward. From a historical perspective, after being very heavily in Pharma and MedTech, I mostly sold out my positions at a profitable level following the downturn of COVID-19 back in 2022 and early 2023. At the time, this was a fairly controversial decision, and one I frankly wasn't 100% sure of at the time either how it would play out. It was probably one of the bigger moves I made in my portfolio without companies being strictly overvalued. I went from around 13% to around 4% where I am today. I'm happy to say that I believe this was the right choice, despite the upside potential in the segment. Let's look at what we have here. Merck KGaA and its upside First off, Merck is a bit confusing. There's the MRK ticker on NYSE, which is Merck, and there's MRK on the German market, which is Merck KGaA. These are two different companies. Note the different logos, which I made an effort to differentiate even in the article pictures for this piece (although I still believe this company's logo is truly ugly). So, one of the things you have with you when investing in Merck KGaA is that this is the oldest still-operating chemical and pharma company on the planet. It's older than most nations in their current configuration because their history goes back to 1668. It has global R&D facilities, and part of its history is the pioneering of morphine, and for a time holding a virtual global monopoly on Cocaine. Not as much today perhaps, but a strong history. The company was private for over 300 years before going public around 30 years ago and has returned a RoR of over 1,100%+ for shareholders that invested in the IPO. It's A-rated and has a low yield, but a great potential upside. The latest results for Merck KGaA were positive, despite the market trends during that time. Merck IR (Merck IR) Current guidance for the full year shows continued EBITDA growth, albeit moderating margins. The company is an M&A-heavy player and does so with leverage, but quickly as of merging, delivers the company within years of such moves. It has done so several times before, delivering down to below 0.3x, and is in the process of doing so again. Merck IR (Merck IR) For 1Q24, all of the company's business units contributed to a very attractive outlook, with sales currently at 51/41/8 for Science & Lab, Process Solutions, and Life Science services respectively. The quarter otherwise saw a slight amount of revenue decline, but two out of three sectors are showing a very strong 1Q24, with continued expectations for improvement. Healthcare was the top performer for the quarter - 10% organic sales growth driven by strong products in the portfolio, with Electronics being up 6% as well. Life Sciences as the smallest segment also showed the strongest decline - and this is mostly due to COVID-19 effects, which still have a negative/headwind effect on company results here. For 2024, Merck wants to revert to growth - and 1Q showed momentum in this overall direction. Guidance comes to net sales of √¢¬Ç¬¨20.5B or slightly above, with an EBITDA of √¢¬Ç¬¨6.3 at the top end, and a top-end EPS of around √¢¬Ç¬¨9.1. This would stand as a good result on a YoY basis given the environment, and this guidance, as of 1Q, is also confirmed here. A good way to describe the current trends for Merck is ""good performance in a fundamentally challenging market"" - and this seems to be a theme for many healthcare and pharma companies out there at this time. This is confirmed when we start to dig into the ratios for the company. I'm used to investing in businesses with a >1 Book-to-bill ratio - the company doesn't have this, it hovers around 1x and has done so for a long time. The next quarters are also likely to be mixed in their quality and results, given that healthcare 10% sales increase is likely to phase down, with an overall company guidance of 4-7% for the full year - so the positives from some segments are likely to be less positive in the next few quarters, and this quarter was actually one of the strong ones, despite how the market reacted to it. The company management in fact confirms this.    Yes. Thanks, Sachin, it's Matthias, for your question. No, I don't want to quantify at this point. I mean, we certainly see the positive momentum, right, both in terms of what intake sequentially year-over-year. We see also the absolute number, going absolutely in the right direction and steering us towards the guidance for the full year. So I think that's sending I think, a clear signal. (Source: Matthias Heinzel, Merck KGaA, 1Q24 call)  It's not wrong to categorize Merck KGaA as a company still in recovery for the most part. Here's the current guidance. Merck KGaA IR (Merck KGaA IR) This also includes assumptions for CaPex of around √¢¬Ç¬¨1.6-√¢¬Ç¬¨1-8B for PP&E, and certain hedging assumptions peaking at 1.11 for the EUR/USD - any change here could influence things either positively or negatively. Perhaps my biggest problem with Merck KGaA since I invested last is that there are many attractive healthcare/pharma companies available at extremely attractive prices. This means that we need to compare this one to others. And perhaps the one problem with Merck KGaA - because we certainly can't point to something like fundamentals as a negative, is the dividend yield. When we have this sort of environment, there isn't exactly a ""siren call"" to invest in something like a sub-1.5% yield at a 17.5x P/E, even if that is for a company with an A-rating and a debt/cap of less than 21% because it means we need to assume a high premium for a company that currently, truth be told, is expected to grow no more than 2% in 2024. In that context, other alternatives of companies with cheaper valuations and higher yields but equally solid fundamentals, suddenly look quite appealing. But if you're fine with this low yield, and are willing to play the very long term (as I am with this investment), you have quite the excellent investment potential here - because Merck KGaA is set to grow over the long term. Let me show you what I mean. Merck KGaA - bad for 2024, stronger potential for 2025-2027. I unfortunately cannot say that Merck KGaA is all that attractive here for this particular year. Even with the company's own assumptions, we're still talking about paying 17-18x P/E for a company when Bristol Myers (BMY) trades at less than 60% of that P/E with a yield of almost 6%, also A-graded (albeit at more elevated leverage. To be clear, my money is in both companies - but I'm saying it should depend on what you're looking for in terms of your investment choices. Merck KGaA has a great upside if you're willing to play for the long term. If you forecast it at a 5-year average, you're beating the market even investing today, with a 43% RoR In 3 years. The problem is that for what other companies with higher, safe yields offer, this isn't all that impressive unless you're specifically looking for this. As things stand, I say that Merck KGaA does warrant a continued ""BUY"" rating, but as a result of the state of the market and the state of this industry, I am actually lowering my price target here. I now believe, based on the 2024E uncertainty and low growth rate, that Merck KGaA is worth around √¢¬Ç¬¨175/share, coming to a 2025E P/E of 18.5x for the 5-year average, but not much above that specific level. (Source: Paywalled F.A.S.T graphs Link) In my previous article, I worked with both DCF estimates and PS value indications if we look at the broader sector where Merck ""plays"" implies minimum valuations of √¢¬Ç¬¨140-√¢¬Ç¬¨160/share - and I don't see any realistic scenario where this company is worth less than √¢¬Ç¬¨150/share in the long term - and the P/E for the long term of around 18.5x makes sense to me here given not only the history but the rock-solid fundamentals that even make players like BMY look ""over-leveraged"" by comparison. The company remains a clearly undervalued player in attractive healthcare, pharma, and electronics space - but this space has in my portfolio given way to investments in other areas and other weightings compared to how I had It previously. I'm not keen on immediately buying more of this company, but I am willing to give the company the following thesis and target/s here. Thesis  Merck KGaA is the world's largest still-operating pharma and healthcare company, with a 300+ year history. It has absolutely stellar fundamentals, and what risks do exist are well-covered by the company's long-term upside and expertise here. I say that at a good valuation, the company is almost a ""must-BUY"" for the long term. While it cannot be said here that Merck KGaA is ""cheap"" yet, because that would for me demand it drop below √¢¬Ç¬¨130/share, it's closing in on being cheap, and it's most definitely an attractive play here. I view Merck KGaA as being a ""BUY"" with a price target of at least √¢¬Ç¬¨175/share for the long term. This implies buying the company's German-listed ticker, which I do believe is the way to go here for the company. I've added shares and may add more.  Remember, I'm all about:  Buying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount, allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime. If the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation, I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks, repeating #1. If the company doesn't go into overvaluation but hovers within a fair value, or goes back down to undervaluation, I buy more as time allows. I reinvest proceeds from dividends, savings from work, or other cash inflows as specified in #1.  Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized).  This company is overall qualitative. This company is fundamentally safe/conservative & well-run. This company pays a well-covered dividend. This company is currently cheap. This company has a realistic upside that is high enough, based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.  I won't call the company ""cheap"" here any longer, but I will say that there is enough upside to interest me, even at my lower share price, and I will say ""BUY"" here.

awynv0OFr5astY3,Seeking Alpha,bing,Screening For The Best SaaS Companies,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702394-screening-for-the-best-saas-companies,2024-07-04 03:44,2024-07-04 03:56,PLTR,,"putilich Thesis SaaS (Software as a Service) companies are unique and cannot be analyzed in a traditional manner, such as looking at GAAP Price/Earnings ratios or Price/Book. This article seeks to find √¢¬Ä¬úbest-in-class√¢¬Ä¬ù SaaS companies using specialized quantitative and qualitative metrics. After discussing the industry√¢¬Ä¬ôs size & growth, I will screen and rank from a list of 84 companies. I note unique attributes of SaaS companies such as operating leverage, scalability and optionality. I will present the top companies as a starting point for readers who can continue to research should they choose to do so. Lastly, I discuss valuations and suggest a way of including SaaS companies into one√¢¬Ä¬ôs portfolio. Industry Size and Growth The broad SaaS industry including cloud infrastructure companies such as Google (GOOG) is huge at $333Bn in 2023 and growing 13.7% annually. Increased penetration of public cloud services (e.g., Amazon AWS) and CRM SaaS solutions have spurred growth, especially since Covid-19 (which increased demand for online education, e-commerce, online supply-chain management, office automation and electronic contracts.   Grand View Research Exponential Growth potential Despite today√¢¬Ä¬ôs focus on AI hardware companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Dell Technologies (DELL), I believe that software will continue eating the world as Marc Andreessen famously said. I believe that SaaS companies are the best positioned for this due to their:  Network effect Scalability Strong FCF potential Optionality (such as integrating AI) Consistency (due to their subscription models)  From None to Many Way back in 2007 when I first dug into the SaaS √¢¬Ä¬úrabbit hole√¢¬Ä¬ù there were few choices. Now thanks to the Fed√¢¬Ä¬ôs money-printing, there are thousands of companies - not all will be successful. I screened for the √¢¬Ä¬úbest√¢¬Ä¬ù SaaS companies based on several KPIs (see below). The data is sourced from S&P Compustat (paywall) Meritech Capital and Glassdoor. Key Operating Metrics It√¢¬Ä¬ôs easy to confuse operating metrics versus financial metrics. Operating Metrics tend to focus on marketing and customers. They measure things like customer behavior and efficiency. I included these:   Magic Number: This metric measures how much revenue growth a company attains versus what was spent on marketing the previous quarter. (Best company: Atlassian (TEAM) √¢¬Ä¬ì but note its high ranking is influenced by its √¢¬Ä¬úSelf-Service√¢¬Ä¬ù business model.)  Payback Period: the time it takes for a company to recover its investment in acquiring a customer. This investment typically includes costs related to marketing, sales, and customer onboarding. (Best: Atlassian)  Key Financial Metrics These metrics are more readily cited by SA contributors. They include:   Gross Profit Margins: While most readers are familiar with gross profitability, I stress that a particular SaaS company√¢¬Ä¬ôs GP margins may appear high when in fact they are significantly below average. For example, in a survey of 84 SaaS companies a 78% GPM would only be a middle of the road company as GPMs can breach 90% (Best: GitLab (GTLB): 91%).  NTF FCF: This is the next twelve month expectations for Free Cash Flow. Note that it includes Stock Based Compensation as a non-cash positive adjustment to cash flow.  Rule of 40: is typically the next FY√¢¬Ä¬ôs revenue growth plus the next FY√¢¬Ä¬ôs FCF margin. Rule of 40 is considered the most important attribute for successful SaaS companies. The tradeoff of Revenue growth and FCF margin change over time depending on a) whether the Fed is raising rates, b) stage in a company√¢¬Ä¬ôs life cycle and c) management or investors√¢¬Ä¬ô focus. For example, older companies (Adobe (ADBE)) tend to have slower revenue growth but higher FCF margins. (Best rated. Veeva (VEEV).  Rule of X: is a modification of the Rule of 40 but it weighs (by 2x) revenue growth in the calculation. According to Bessemer Venture Partners SaaS companies with high Rule of X, trade at 2x-3x higher valuations compared to peers (Chart). (Best Rated: Monday.com (MNDY), CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Snowflake (SNOW)).    Bessemer Venture Partners   ARR/FTE: Annual Recurring Revenue divided by the number of Full Time Employees. An ARR is pure subscription revenue so it excludes one-time payments and one-time discounts. While ARR is an important metric, I would caution readers from comparing them with other companies without first understanding their business models. For example, √¢¬Ä¬úself-service√¢¬Ä¬ù business models such as Dropbox would have significantly lower ARR (given lower price-points) and lower CAC (customer acquisition costs). (Best rated: Palantir (PLTR)).  Net Dollar Retention (NDR): measures recurring revenue from existing customers over a set period. It is affected by churn but doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt include new customers. I consider NDR the second-most important metric, hence I√¢¬Ä¬ôve written about Snowflake and CrowdStrike √¢¬Ä¬ì both have high NDR. Unfortunately, not all companies report NDR and some use different calculation methods.  Key Qualitative Metrics: It√¢¬Ä¬ôs important to determine each company√¢¬Ä¬ôs position within its addressable market and the durability of their growth. These metrics include:   Glassdoor Ratings: rates three criteria: overall Employee Satisfaction, CEO Approval and Recommend to a Friend. The table ranks CEO approval. Zoom (ZM), which was the highest-rated company in 2020 has seen its Glassdoor ratings deteriorate as its Covid-related growth stalled. (Best rated: Monday.com, ServiceNow (NOW)  Business Position: can be measured using the Forrester Wave or the Gartner Magic Quadrant (chart below is for CRM software). Every company included in the table is ranked highly (Leaders/Visionaries) in the Magic Quadrant. Note that leading companies in this table tend to be in multiple businesses, reflecting their broadening TAMs.  Net Promotor Score (NPS) is a metric based on existing customers√¢¬Ä¬ô likelihood to recommend a product or service. However, not all SaaS companies have NPS scores and I√¢¬Ä¬ôm not certain how reliable they are. Hence NPS was not included in the table for the time-being.    Gartner Table Ranking Discussion: According to studies on successful SaaS companies, there is a certain scale a SaaS company must achieve in order to become successful. Hence in the table below, I√¢¬Ä¬ôve screened for companies with an Enterprise Value greater than $10Bn. The table ranks 7 criteria (equally weighted) for those broad categories of metrics mentioned above. The best companies have the lowest values under the √¢¬Ä¬úOverall Score√¢¬Ä¬ù column. But again, all 10 are best-in-class. For the most part, these companies ranked in the top half for all criteria. I tend to focus on those companies that rank highly for Rule of 40, Net Dollar Retention and Glassdoor. Most of these companies rank above the Regression line. If you recall, that line is created when all of the SaaS companies√¢¬Ä¬ô EV/forward Revenues (Y-axis) are plotted against their Revenue Growth Rate (X-axis).   Author's creation It√¢¬Ä¬ôs not all √¢¬Ä¬úSunshine & Roses√¢¬Ä¬ù Of course, not all is positive. These business models are global and take many more years to develop compared to traditional companies, they also require significant funding in order to deal with the √¢¬Ä¬ú Cold Start Problem√¢¬Ä¬ù and are subject to the √¢¬Ä¬úFeast & Famine√¢¬Ä¬ù of the venture-capital (and liquidity) cycle. Hence, many companies are generating GAAP net losses. The SaaS model√¢¬Ä¬ôs consistent and predictable revenue stream offers, well, consistent & predictable stock prices, in theory. However, in practice, SaaS share prices have been particularly volatile. Even mega-cap Salesforce (CRM) witnessed a 19.4% stock decline after publishing 1Q√¢¬Ä¬ô25 earnings. Valuations There are great companies with bad stocks and vice versa. CrowdStrike (a great company) trades at the highest revenue multiple in the industry √¢¬Ä¬ì a bad stock ? Zoom Video trades at the lowest valuation (2.3x revenues) and has over $7Bn in net cash and a whopping 38% FCF margin. But for now, some say its shares are √¢¬Ä¬údead-money.√¢¬Ä¬ù   Y-Charts Portfolio diversification with SaaS As a former Risk Manager, I am very attuned to portfolio risk & diversification. Until recently, one could simply buy the S&P 500 INDEX (via an ETF) and call it a day. However, today√¢¬Ä¬ôs S&P 500 is significantly weighted to the Magnificent 7, hence I would recommend diversifying into value funds and a handful of those names above. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm not fond of SaaS/Cloud Computing ETFs (First Trust, Global X, WisdomTree√¢¬Ä¬¶) as they have unrelated names or few of my top 10 in their top holdings. Remember, the list above is the beginning of a research effort √¢¬Ä¬ì not the end all. Perhaps dollar-cost-averaging into individual names that have had a √¢¬Ä¬úbad quarter√¢¬Ä¬ù could be fruitful. I am constructive on all names with the exception of Palantir which is extremely overvalued and its CEO is admired by only 63% of employees. That√¢¬Ä¬ôs the worst percentage I√¢¬Ä¬ôve ever seen in a SaaS company and makes one wonder√¢¬Ä¬¶  Note: If you would like me to conduct a √¢¬Ä¬úDeep-Dive√¢¬Ä¬ù on any of these names, let me know in the comments.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

9bIGYLrtbxTxTRO,Yahoo Finance,google,The new peril facing Boeing if it pleads guilty to US criminal charge,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-new-peril-facing-boeing-if-it-pleads-guilty-to-us-criminal-charge-080038382.html,2024-07-04 04:00,2024-07-04 04:13,BA,,"Boeing faces new perils if federal prosecutors revive a criminal charge against the aviation giant by the end of this week, and the company decides to plead guilty.A plea deal could get rejected by a judge. Big fines will have to be paid. And perhaps the biggest danger is the effect that a conviction may have on Boeing‚Äôs already-battered bottom line.Criminal convictions can foreclose or suspend a company‚Äôs right to contract with the federal government and frustrate its ability to secure loans, according to Eddie Jauregui, a white collar defense attorney with Holland & Knight and former federal prosecutor.Those consequences have particular meaning for Boeing, which counts the federal government as its largest customer. It also happens to be the country‚Äôs largest exporter.A Boeing 737 Max jet, in 2020. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The matter could end up with an executive agency known as the Interagency Suspension and Debarment Committee (ISDC), which holds power to discuss government-wide suspensions and debarments that can end or disrupt a company‚Äôs business with the US government.""The considerations are many, and they are weighty,"" Jauregui said. ""I think the government contract work is probably an extremely important component for Boeing.""The question that will be resolved by Sunday is whether Boeing's actions leading up to a January door plug blowout aboard an Alaska Airlines (ALK) Boeing 737 Max 9 cause top DOJ officials to officially revoke legal protections extended to Boeing in a January 2021 deferred prosecution agreement.After investigations into two Max 737-8 crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, Boeing admitted that two of its former Max test pilots deceived the FAA about a flight control system called Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS.Prosecutors agreed to table a charge alleging that Boeing conspired to defraud the federal government so long as Boeing spent three years designing, implementing and enforcing a compliance and ethics program for safer manufacturing and oversight practices.But prosecutors told a judge in May that Boeing had violated that three-year agreement.It now appears, according to multiple reports, that the DOJ will in fact bring a new criminal charge against Boeing but give the company the chance to plead guilty in exchange for some conditions.If Boeing chooses not to plead guilty, the DOJ could take the company to trial, according to these reports.The Chicago law firm that represents families of people killed in the Boeing 737 Max crashes said the families ""would most certainly object"" to what it called a ""sweetheart plea deal"" described to them during a two-hour call last Sunday with DOJ officials.Story continuesThe deal included the imposition of a corporate monitor and a fine; the law firm said families would ask that a judge reject it.By law, the maximum penalty for a conviction on the DOJ‚Äôs conspiracy charge is $487 million. Boeing, however, would receive credit against additional penalties based on penalties it has already agreed to pay.The U.S. Justice Department seal, in Washington. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Boeing and the DOJ would in fact need court approval to enter a plea deal.If a deal were rejected, Boeing and the government could then go back to the drawing board to negotiate new terms, or the government could press forward with charges.Matthieu Goddeyne, a former federal prosecutor and white collar defense lawyer for Gunster, said a guilty plea from Boeing still leaves the Justice Department with the difficult task of enforcing the law while also trying to uphold victims‚Äô rights and encourage safe aircraft manufacturing.""I don't necessarily think that the government's job is to try and make Boeing fail, or try and put thousands of people out of work,"" Goddeyne said. ""I think that their job is to try to do justice, to do right by the victims, and try and effectuate some change within the company.""Boeing didn‚Äôt comment on whether it had been offered a plea deal. However, in May it said it believed it had complied with its obligations under the DOJ‚Äôs deferred prosecution agreement.In the end company leaders may be forced to accept one of two bad choices: admit the company committed a felony, or risk criminal trial.""It's never an easy decision for a company, especially one that is as tied with the United States government as Boeing, to make a decision to plead guilty,"" Jauregi said.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

435c4sgEOkFChFS,Yahoo Finance,yahoo,Apple's New Artificial Intelligence (AI) Features Could Push This Semiconductor Company to a $1...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-artificial-intelligence-ai-features-080800296.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,2024-07-04 04:08,2024-07-04 04:19,AAPL,,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) unveiled its new artificial intelligence features dubbed ""Apple Intelligence"" at its Worldwide Developers Conference a few weeks ago. The highlights include text generation and summarization across apps, advanced AI-assisted photo editing capabilities, and a much smarter and more powerful Siri. It also integrates third-party services like ChatGPT for more advanced prompts.What makes Apple Intelligence so compelling is the amount of AI processing it does on the device. Instead of taking your query, sending it to a server along with any relevant data, waiting for the server to process your request, and then downloading the results to your device, the entire process happens on your iPhone, Mac, or iPad. For more advanced queries requiring a larger foundation model, Apple uses its own servers and system called Private Cloud Compute, which protects users' privacy.Both of those developments could be a major win for one of Apple's biggest suppliers. Since all of these new features run on Apple-designed silicon, chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.¬†(NYSE: TSM) could see an increase in orders due to Apple Intelligence. What's more, as Apple leads the way in on-device AI processing, it could push other device makers to buy more advanced chips from TSMC as well.Image source: Getty Images.Pushing artificial intelligence to the edgeWith Apple Intelligence, Apple is ushering in the next phase of artificial intelligence known as edge AI (when data and algorithms are processed directly on the end device, in this case a smartphone, tablet, or personal computer).In order to process AI queries on device, though, the devices need to be capable. That means hardware that's even just a few years old might not be able to handle AI requests as well as newer devices can, if they can even handle them at all. Apple, for example, is limiting Apple Intelligence features to the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the forthcoming iPhone 16 devices. (Note the limiting factor here is the amount of short-term memory, or RAM, on the device, not the processors themselves.)As a result, Apple could see strong demand from users eager to upgrade their phones over the next few years as Apple Intelligence features roll out around the world. And more iPhone sales means more demand for TSMC's chips.But TSMC doesn't just supply chips for Apple. It manufactures the majority of chips in the world, accounting for over 60% of the market. That scale gives it a massive competitive advantage over smaller foundries, as it can invest more money in R&D to develop more advanced processes to print more powerful and energy-efficient chips. That ensures it keeps existing customers like Apple that are looking for leading-edge chips, and it attracts more of their business. It also helps TSMC draw in new customers as innovations like edge AI push companies to adopt new chip designs.Story continuesThe Apple cloud is just getting startedIn order to support third-party large language models (LLMs) and its own more advanced LLM, Apple created Private Cloud Compute (PCC). The system uses Apple servers that also deploy the tech titan's own chip designs.It's worth noting that Apple isn't using the platform to train AI models. It's using PCC to process data and algorithms that would require more compute power than what's available on consumer devices. The first implementation is sending prompts to ChatGPT.There's a lot of potential for Apple to grow its data center capacity as it partners with more businesses and developers looking to integrate their AI services with Apple's platform. When the company announced its partnership with OpenAI's ChatGPT, it said it's working to bring more partners to the platform later this year. If Apple pushes developers to use PCC, it could further increase Apple's demand for TSMC's services. It also offers another way for Apple to generate income from developers.There's a long runway for Apple to grow AI features through third-party integrations. Just consider the phenomenal growth of the App Store over the past 15 years. Similar growth would be a boon for both Apple and TSMC.Making a $1 trillion semiconductor companyTSMC already has a market cap of around $900 billion. Even so, shares look undervalued at today's price given the growth potential spurred by continued demand for AI chips.The stock trades for about 27x forward earnings estimates, which is a more than fair price to pay. It should be able to grow its earnings fast enough to justify that price as demand for more advanced chips supports its top-line growth and improves its operating margins. Analysts expect earnings will increase over 25% next year.A strong iPhone upgrade cycle over the next few years, incremental demand from Apple's new data centers, and the overall push toward edge computing all favor¬†TSMC's continued growth. Its competitive advantage in creating the most advanced, powerful, and energy-efficient chips will serve it well over the next few years. It's only a matter of time before the company tops a $1 trillion market cap.Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn‚Äôt one of them.

Here's How High the AI Stock Could Soar,...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-completed-10-1-stock-081200705.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,2024-07-04 04:12,2024-07-04 04:19,NVDA,,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have quite literally carried the stock market higher. Since January 2023, the stock has advanced 740% due to enthusiasm about artificial intelligence. The S&P 500¬†returned 44% during the same period. Put differently, Nvidia accounted for roughly one-fifth of the gains in the S&P 500 during the last 18 months.Nvidia reset its surging share price with a 10-for-1 stock split in June, its second split in three years. Shares have since traded sideways, but Wall Street remains bullish. Nvidia carries an average price target of $136 per share, implying 11% upside from its current price of $122 per share.The highest price target comes from Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt, who believes Nvidia will climb 64% to reach $200 per share by June 2025. The lowest price target comes from Gil Luria at D.A. Davidson, who believes Nvidia will decline 26% to reach $90 per share during the same period.Read on to learn more.Nvidia has an important competitive advantage in its ecosystem of supporting softwareNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) excel at accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI). The company consistently sets performance records at the MLPerf benchmarks and objective tests for AI technologies, and it holds a greater than 80% market share in AI chips. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it has reinforced its dominance in AI chips with an ever-expanding ecosystem of supporting software.Nvidia introduced the CUDA programming model in 2006, a software layer that allowed its GPUs (originally designed for computer graphics) to function as general purpose data center processors. ""Millions of lines of code have been written over the years for CUDA that have made developing new AI applications easier when using Nvidia's chips,"" according to The Wall Street Journal.More recently, Nvidia introduced AI Enterprise, a suite of pretrained models and software tools that streamline the development and deployment of AI applications across a broad number of use cases. For instance, the AI Enterprise suite includes frameworks for recommender systems, logistics route optimization, conversational assistants, cybersecurity threat detection, and autonomous robots.Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann sees that as an important competitive advantage. ""The real narrative lies in the software that complements all the hardware goodness,"" Mosesmann recently told clients. ""We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix.""Story continuesOn the flip side, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria is concerned that Nvidia derives most of its revenue from Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla. Those four companies are developing their own AI chips to displace Nvidia GPUs. Luria thinks that competition will be problematic, stating, ""Looking beyond the next four to six quarters, we believe a decline in demand for Nvidia compute is inevitable.""Both analysts make valid points, but the argument made by Mosesmann seems to trump the concerns raised by Luria. Competitors are indeed building custom AI chips, but history suggests they will need a comparable software ecosystem to truly displace Nvidia. For instance, Alphabet has been using custom AI chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for nearly a decade. But Nvidia GPUs remain the gold standard.Indeed, Toshiya Hari at Goldman Sachs is not concerned about the competition. ""We believe Nvidia will remain the de facto industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive advantage that spans hardware and software capabilities,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""Nvidia's annual introduction of new products and platforms sets a pace of innovation that keeps it at the forefront of the industry.""Wall Street has lofty expectations concerning Nvidia's revenue and earnings growthNvidia reported exceptional financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28, 2024). Revenue increased 262% to $26 billion and non-GAAP net income surged 462% to $15.2 billion. CEO Jensen Huang said growth was ""fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference"" solutions.What makes Nvidia's first-quarter performance particularly impressive is that it comes on top of triple-digit growth in the three preceding quarters, as shown in the chart below.Nvidia's revenue and non-GAAP net income have increased at a triple-digit pace for four consecutive quarters.Going forward, Wall Street analysts have high expectations for Nvidia. The chart below shows the consensus revenue and non-GAAP net income estimates over the next five quarters.Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow revenue and non-GAAP net income quickly over the next five quarters.Nvidia stock trades at a tolerable valuation compared to Wall Street's earnings estimatesI mentioned earlier that Nvidia shares have gained 740% since the beginning of January 2023. After that price appreciation, investors may assume Nvidia sports an exorbitant valuation. But the stock currently trades at 72 times earnings, a discount to the three-year average of 87 times earnings and the five-year average of 80 times earnings.Moreover, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share by 33% annually over the next three to five years. That makes the current valuation look tolerable. Investors should not kid themselves into thinking the stock is cheap. But Nvidia remains one of the best ways for patient investors to expose their portfolios to AI, a market forecast to grow by 36% annually through 2030.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Nvidia wasn‚Äôt one of them.

However, it's been playing second fiddle to Apple for years and only recently slid into first place since Apple has been under some pressure.Amazon (AMZN -1.21%) is only in fifth place on the list of U.S. companies with the highest market caps, also behind Alphabet. It has extraordinary growth opportunities in several of its businesses, and the second-highest sales of any U.S. company behind Walmart. Can it become the most valuable company in the world?What is market cap and why does it matter?Market cap is simply the price per share multiplied by the outstanding share count. In other words, it's the total dollar value of all of a company's stock. Amazon stock trades at $193 per share, and there are 10.4 billion shares outstanding, so the market cap is over $2 trillion. That makes it the fifth most-valuable company on the stock market.NVDA market cap data by YCharts.As you can see in the chart above, Apple had been the most valuable company until recently, when Microsoft took over and Nvidia briefly topped it.Market cap tells investors a few things. Highly valued companies are best in class, and they have proved that over time. Investors have piled in because these companies perform, quarter after quarter, and they're large businesses that drive the economy. In general, you can count on them to deliver, and they're low risk.But highly valued companies might offer less growth for investors, since they're already so valuable. For the top three stocks here to even double at this point, they would be worth more than $6 trillion.Is it possible? Yes. But that comes with its own risk, since they would need to sustain their high value. It's easier to see Amazon or Alphabet doubling from where they are today.In terms of valuation, none of these stocks are cheap. They all get a premium valuation for their reliable track records and incredible businesses. Nvidia tops them, trading at 73 times trailing-12-month earnings, and Amazon comes in second at 55.Why Amazon stock can reach the topAmazon struggled a bit, like many companies, when inflation started soaring in 2022. It rebounded already last year, but the stock only surpassed its previous highs a few weeks ago, and it could be in its best position in a long time.One reason is generative artificial intelligence (AI). It's today's hot topic, but it might have more staying power than other recent trends like cryptocurrency and the metaverse, and Amazon is a major player.It has launched a powerful set of AI tools for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients, and as the leading worldwide cloud computing company, it stands to benefit in a big way from adoption of these tools. According to consulting company McKinsey, as much as 30% of workplace hours could be automated through generative AI, and it could add $4.4 trillion to the economy.Amazon is at the forefront of these endeavors, and CEO Andy Jassy recently said, ""I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time.""But it's not just AI, with Jassy adding, ""We have a lot of growth in front of us, and that's before the generative AI opportunity."" He said that AWS is already a $100 billion run-rate business, and that 85% of global spending on information technology is still on-premises, meaning not in the cloud. That leaves a massive opportunity for further spending in AWS.And AWS isn't even its biggest business, which is still e-commerce. Amazon has an unbeatable lead in that category globally and accounts for nearly 38% of all U.S. e-commerce. It has made strides in improving logistics to get more deliveries out faster, and as it speeds up shipments, more shoppers rely on it for even more of their daily essentials, leading to a positive growth cycle.The company's fastest-growing business these days is advertising, which increased 24% year over year in the 2024 first quarter. It's a high-margin business, and with its new ad-supported streaming tier for Prime Video, Amazon is finding more ways to monetize its advertising capabilities.It has an edge in this business because when customers see advertisements on the company's platform, they're already looking to buy, and that can lead to incredible conversion rates.Amazon can certainly muscle its way to the top of the market-value chain, just as it's pushing ahead and getting closer to becoming the largest U.S. company by sales. Regardless, it has tremendous opportunities in many ways, and its stock is a no-brainer buy.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rivian Automotive (RIVN -1.61%) -- one of the most successful EV brands besides Tesla -- inked a $5 billion deal with Volkswagen to fund future growth and build a software/technology joint venture group. Rivian stock shot up over 30% on the news and is now up 27% in the past month.This deal is huge for Rivian. Burning a ton of cash and running out of money from its initial public offering (IPO), Rivian can utilize this funding to further scale its operations and hopefully reach positive cash flow.Here's the skinny on the deal and what comes next for the EV stock.Volkswagen deal: $5 billion capital cushionThe $5 billion deal with Volkswagen comes with multiple steps. There is an initial investment of $1 billion, and then $4 billion coming over the next two years. In addition, $2 billion of future investment will be in Rivian equity (i.e., common stock), while $2 billion from Volkswagen will contribute to the newly formed joint venture group. At the end of Q1, Rivian had a cash balance of $7.9 billion. While this seems like a lot, the company is burning $5.6 billion a year in free cash flow. This new funding extends Rivian's timeline for achieving profitability, which will likely take multiple years, given that the brand is still subscale (it only expects to produce 57,000 vehicles this year).The deal not only gives Rivian a cash cushion, but also a huge partner to deploy its advanced vehicle software and technology to. According to the announcement, Volkswagen is planning to deploy Rivian's electronic hardware and software systems for its future vehicles beginning in the second half of this decade. This will help Rivian further scale its operations and bring in more revenue over its fixed-cost investments, hopefully leading to operating leverage on the income statement.Can Rivian reach positive cash flow?Rivian is burning a ton of cash. It lost $5.6 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months on just $5 billion in sales. Clearly, it needs to scale its EV manufacturing in order to stem this burn and eventually reach positive cash flow. Otherwise, the stock will not be worth much.At its recent Investor Day, management stated that it can reach annual production of 150,000 vehicles on its current operations. Then, it plans to reach 215,000 with the addition of the new vehicle called the R2, and eventually another 400,000 more in capacity from future vehicles called the R3 and R3X. This would bring annual production from 57,000 today to over 600,000 within just a few years, a 10x in volume growth.If/when this happens, Rivian believes it can consistently bring down its unit costs. The plan is for a 20% cost reduction for the second generation of its first vehicle, called the R1, and then a further 45% cost reduction on the R2. With gross margins of -44% today, it is imperative for the company to achieve these cost cuts. Right now, its unit economics are unsustainable. RIVN Free Cash Flow data by YChartsWhat comes next?In the near term, there are two things Rivian investors need to watch: production volume and gross margins. Both are related for a car manufacturer, and will need to improve in the coming years in order to stem the current unsustainable cash burn.Over the coming three to five years, Rivian will need to increase its deliveries to hit its planned production capacity of 600,000 vehicles. More scale along with cost cuts on a per-unit basis can help gross margins move from -45% to 25%, management's stated long-term goal. Over the long term, investors need to be tracking whether Rivian hits its long-term target of a 10% free cash flow margin. If they hit this estimate while growing production volumes by 10x, the stock will likely do well for investors who buy today. If they keep burning cash forever, the stock will not be worth much, though.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
Xg0xtkpD9E83lxe,Seeking Alpha,google,NextEra Energy: Much Better Dividend Choices Available Amongst Utilities (NYSE:NEE),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702405-nextera-energy-much-better-dividend-choices-available-amongst-utilities,2024-07-04 04:36,2024-07-04 04:43,NEE,,"Florida Power and Light FPL Solar Powered trees in the park felixmizioznikov/iStock Editorial via Getty Images We turned bearish on NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) at the beginning of the year. A strong bounce off the lows was behind us, earnings estimates were optimistic and the valuation was aloft. The stock price had room to drop and the valuation would still remain in the unreasonable territory. Using historical data, metrics such as the EV to EBITDA and P/E ratio favored close to a 30% price decline from that point. The conclusion to that piece noted the crux of the matter. NEE was the ultimate posterchild of the ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) bubble. That unwinding will take a lot more time, and downside risks abound. Of course here, one key facet is that we believe interest rates are headed higher at the long end. Those that use the Fed Cuts to justify their stance should know that long end rates being 2% over the short end is about as normal as things get when examining the long-term history. So even if you embrace the 6 rate cuts, know that the average situation would call for 10 Year yields at 5.5% in that case. Source: NextEra Energy's Next Leg Down The price is higher by close to 16% and along with the dividends, the stock returned 17.5% to its investors since then. Seeking Alpha That of course feels awful. Nothing worse than missing out a bull run because you are bearish at the wrong time. We take the opportunity to tell you why we are sticking with our call and think that the stock will ultimately go much lower. Q1-2024 Q1-2024 was a disappointment for the NEE bull community. The giant moved its earnings guidance lower after beating the adjusted earnings number. While the company stuck to its earnings range for 2025 and 2026, they were off a slightly lower base. The consensus numbers were also at the very high end of the range NEE presented. The good news there was the company affirming its rapid dividend growth. NEE promised 10% increases in both 2025 and 2026. The Macro NEE trades at around 20X earnings. Seeking Alpha The growth rate should be hitting around 6% a year. NEE's range is for 6% to 8%, and we think the low end is more likely in the next 3 years. None of those numbers look bad in relation to where the stock traded as recently as 2021. In December 2021, the stock was near $95 per share and at a stunning 37.5X earnings (for 2021). It is fairly easy to declare that we are done now, and the stock can resume its long-term trajectory. We think there will be two hurdles here. The first being that capital markets tend to create excesses in one direction followed by excesses in the other. So that 37.5X multiple will likely be followed at some point by significant undervaluation. Some might argue that the 17X multiple we saw near its October 2023 level was good enough. We don't think so, as utilities as an asset class generally trade near the 12X-14X mark. This is definitely true when interest rates are not anchored to zero. So a 17X multiple is far from even fair valuation and definitely not a sign of undervaluation. The second aspect here is that the free flowing risk-on environment is very conducive to the overall multiple. We don't believe that will last forever and in the next recession, NEE's growth push and regulatory approvals will be challenged. Verdict Price matters and valuation matters. We even suggested a long side play on NEE near the 2023 bottom. We are flexible in our approach and if NEE starts looking like it has at least partially corrected the excesses, we would move to a more constructive stance. As things stand, NEE remains fairly expensive. This is something even the income investors will acknowledge. You can see how NEE stands against comparable high-quality utilities like Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ED), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW). Data by YCharts PNW is the best comparative here by far. It yields almost 2% more than NEE. It trades at a 16X multiple. We can expect similar growth rates for both. Seeking Alpha So why would you want to pay extra for NEE? We continue to rate this a Sell. NextEra Energy, Inc. UNIT 09/01/25 (NEE.PR.R) While no one will be chasing NEE for its dividend yield, they might run after NEE.PR.R. We can hear their thinking process. ""8.5% dividend yield from NEE, sign me up!"" Seeking Alpha If that seemed to lack any due diligence, then well, that is how the standard income investor functions. We saw this in the case of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp., (AQN) and its mandatory convertible units, which had the ticker AQNU. Both prices tracked each other fairly closely, and legions of analysts were surprised as they actually missed the first two words in our description. Mandatory convertible. While NEE does not use the term, it is obvious that you are going to have to do this exchange within 14 months: The stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase for $50 a variable number of shares of NextEra Energy, Inc. common stock no later than 9/1/2025 and pays a contract adjustment rate of 2.326% per annum. The stock purchase settlement rate will be 0.4500 shares per unit if the then current market price is equal to or greater than $111.10 and 0.5626 shares per unit if the market price is equal to or less than $88.88. For market prices between those values the settlement rate will be $50 divided by the market value. Prior to the IPO of this security, the last reported sale price of the common stock on 9/14/2022 was $88.88 per share. The stock purchase contract may be settled any time at the holder's option and the company will deliver 0.4500 shares of common stock for each purchase contract. Source: Quantum Online  So, in essence, you are getting common shares, but you have to adjust for the higher dividend in the interim. Using the 0.5626 shares of NEE, we get a fair value of around $40 for NEE. Of course, this disregards the higher payments until then. At the current price of $42.50, NEE.PR.R is slightly overvalued, even taking into account the hefty yield differential. Since we rate NEE a Sell, we will rate NEE.PR.R a Sell as well.

5xHSV3KW7JWPev2,The Motley Fool,google,This Metric Shows Why Costco Is the Best Retail Stock to Own,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/04/this-metric-shows-why-costco-is-the-best-retail-st/,2024-07-04 04:45,2024-07-04 04:49,HD,,"If you're looking for a top retail stock to own, it's hard to go wrong with Costco Wholesale (COST 0.38%). The company has consistently shown that it can do well in a variety of situations. You might assume that a retailer that has become synonymous with large, bulk purchases would struggle as consumers battle with rising costs and try to scale back on spending, but that hasn't been the case. The business is doing well, even with inflation remaining at elevated levels.Costco has proven time and time again that it can deliver value to shoppers. And that, in turn, has resulted in some solid results -- and great returns for investors. The company has set itself apart from other retailers, and that is evident through one impressive metric.Costco's same-store sales were up nearly 7% last quarterSame-store sales growth, which looks at stores open more than one year, is the metric retail investors should focus on when reviewing a company's financial results. That figure doesn't take into account store closures and new locations, which makes it a better indicator of how a business is doing. A company could simply open more locations and generate more revenue growth that way. But for same-store sales numbers to be rising, then existing locations would need to be growing. Costco posted its latest results in May, and for the period ending May 12, its same-store sales growth was 6.6%. That's impressive when you consider how it stacks up against other retailers. While the periods may be slightly different, here are how other retailers have done in their most recent quarters.CompanyMost Recent Same-Store Sales GrowthWalmart (U.S.)3.8%Nordstrom3.8%Ross Stores3%TJX3%Burlington2%Dollar Tree1%Home Depot(2.8%)Target(3.7%)Lowe's(4.1%)Best Buy(6.1%)Data source: Company filings.There's definitely a trend of discretionary spending being down recently, which is evidenced by the notable declines reported by home repair giants Lowe's and Home Depot. Similarly, Target depends on discretionary spending and it posted a big drop in sales recently. But even discount retailers and dollar stores haven't been able to keep up with Costco's impressive same-store growth.While this is just the most recent period of strong sales, it isn't unusual for Costco to outperform its peers.Investors are paying a big premium for Costco's stockAs a result of its resounding success and continued expansion, Costco has been a go-to option for many investors. Year to date, the retail stock is up 28%. And at 52 times earnings, investors are paying a big premium for it compared to other retailers.P/E ratio among major retailers data by YChartsThe danger with a high valuation is that there can be a long way for the stock to fall if future quarters don't remain strong. Costco has been able to do well but the risk is that if its same-store sales growth slows down, the shares could be vulnerable to a sizable sell-off.Should you buy Costco's stock today?Costco has definitely shown that its business is better and more adaptable to changing conditions than other retailers. And it's a great long-term investment to hold because Costco still has more markets it can penetrate in the future. That means a lot more opportunities for the company to get even bigger and more profitable.But given such an expensive valuation, it's clear investors are anticipating a lot of future growth. That means it's important to temper your expectations in the short term, because it could be a bumpy ride. As long as you're OK with that, this could be a stock you can safely buy and forget about.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Others are interested in moving internationally for reasons such as better quality of life, health care and more affordable retirement.¬†While many people are interested in moving to Mexico or Canada because of their proximity to the U.S., Harvey said Europe is actually the most in-demand among his clientele, particularly Spain and France. He attributes that to many Americans being comfortable with the Spanish language and also how fast the Spanish and French visa process can be, possibly just a month.¬†Learn more: Best travel insuranceHere‚Äôs what to know about moving to Canada, Mexico or Europe.¬†Thinking of working remotely?The top 5 safest, healthiest countries for female digital nomadsCan I move to Canada? Can I move to Mexico? Can I move to Europe?Yes, you can move to Canada, Mexico, or somewhere in Europe. It all depends on how you meet that country‚Äôs requirements and which visa is right for you.¬†‚ÄúWhat is the best way for them to enter the country and stay in the country?‚Äù Harvey said. ‚ÄúIt all depends on your profile, like age and qualifications.‚Äù For example, depending on your profession, you could open a business in Canada and move there relatively quickly to start the business and then do the visa process later on.¬†Another important factor to take into consideration is taxes, Harvey said. Many countries in Europe as well as Mexico and Canada have a double taxation agreement with the U.S. so you won‚Äôt be paying the same taxes twice.¬†Also, consider how easy it is to return home and see family and friends. For some places in Europe, there are many flights between the U.S. For Mexico and Canada, it could be a quick flight or an easy drive across the border.¬†How do I move to Canada as an American?The easiest way for an American to relocate to Canada is through the Express Entry system, aimed at three types of skilled immigrants who want to settle in Canada, according to the Government of Canada website. Depending on the program, applicants must submit proof of at least one to two years of work experience plus other documentation like education assessments and language tests. After completing the required documentation, applicants will get a score that will determine if they can apply for residency. Unfortunately, the process can be slow, possibly up to two years, Harvey said.You may be luckier if you have close relatives in Canada, like a child or parent, who can sponsor you. Applicants can also look for a work permit if their work falls into one of the professional categories, such as accounting, of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Work permits are usually issued for two to three years and can be renewed.¬†How do I move to Mexico as an American?One of the most straightfoward ways to move to Mexico is through its retirement program, Harvey said. To apply for permanent residency in Mexico, you must prove you have at least $292,858 in investments or your bank account during the previous 12 months, or at least $7,321.47 in monthly income from your job or pension after taxes.¬†Another way to move to Mexico is by purchasing property, which is technically illegal for non-Mexican citizens but can be done through an organization of record. In that case, you‚Äôd be using the name of an institution when purchasing.¬†How do I move to Europe as an American?There are two easy ways to move to Europe as an American, according to Harvey. The first method is if you have ancestral ties to the country. Dozens of countries ‚Äì such as Portugal, Spain and France ‚Äì offer citizenship through descent, but it depends on how many generations ago.¬†‚ÄúThere are a lot of programs out there based on ancestry; just the fact your great-grandfather is Spanish is enough to get a full citizenship in Spain,‚Äù he said.¬†Italy‚Äôs citizenship by descent ‚Äúis based on the principle of jure sanguinis (right of blood),‚Äù according to the Italian Consulate of London. You just have to prove you have an Italian ancestor who emigrated abroad and was born in Italy, even if it was over a century ago.France requires you to have one French grandparent and parent who will also apply for citizenship. French language speaking is not required.¬†Many European countries also offer digital nomad visas, which allow you to live abroad and work remotely for a company elsewhere, so long as you meet a few requirements. Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal are just a few of the countries that offer that type of visa.¬†For Spain‚Äôs digital nomad visa, you must show certification of working for at least three months, proof of residence in Spain and financial means of at least 200% of the monthly Spanish national minimum wage of ‚Ç¨1,134 (or about $1,217), according to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation. An applicant‚Äôs children and spouse can also apply for that visa.¬†Kathleen Wong is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Hawaii. You can reach her at kwong@usatoday.com.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

A bad score can cost you that much.Your credit score largely determines how much interest you pay on a car loan. And interest rates are running high.The average new car loan was $40,366 in 2023. But the total cost of the loan can range from $46,419 to $57,339, depending on the interest rate, according to an analysis by the personal finance site MarketWatch Guides.The average used car loan was $26,685. Factor in the interest, though, and the total cost of that loan ranges from $32,205 to $43,812.Interest rates on car loans are as high as they‚Äôve been in years. The average rate on a new car ranges from 5.4%, for those with the highest credit scores, to 15.6%, for those with the weakest credit, according to Experian.

A bigger down payment means a lower rate.Second, it means lower monthly payments, because you‚Äôre borrowing less money.Third, it means you pay less interest over the lifetime of the loan because, again, you‚Äôre borrowing less money.Work on your credit scoreIf you have some time before your car purchase, try to raise your credit score.According to the MarketWatch analysis, if you raise your score from 650 to 700, you could potentially lower your interest rate from 14% to under 10% on a used vehicle, saving you more than $3,000.Get a free copy of your credit report.

QdtHdv8P334kYaK,Seeking Alpha,bing,"Nvidia: Despite Red Flags, It's Going Much Higher",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702112-nvidia-despite-red-flags-its-going-much-higher,2024-07-04 05:26,2024-07-04 05:32,NVDA,,"Nvidia: Despite 4 Red Flags, It's Going MUCH Higher JHVEPhotoNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the dominant semiconductor leader, powering explosive megatrend growth in the great cloud migration and now artificial intelligence. And these truly massive megatrends are not coming to an end anytime soon. However, there are multiple glaring √¢¬Ä¬úred flags√¢¬Ä¬ù for Nvidia. In this report, we review the business, growth, market size, current valuation, moat and then four massive red flags investors need to consider. We conclude with our strong opinion on investing. Nvidia Overview: The Leader in GPUs Nvidia is the industry leader in graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs were originally used for video gaming (because of their superiority vs. traditional non-parallel processing computer processing units (CPUs)) but have proven invaluable in data centers now processing massive amounts of data from the cloud and recently accelerated dramatically by the compute demands of artificial intelligence (i.e., technological breakthroughs in large language models). When it comes to data centers and AI, Nvidia is the clear and dominant leader. Business Segments and Growth For perspective on Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs massive recent growth, here's a look at its revenue growth between fiscal year 2023 and 2024. And then compared to the continuing high growth so far in fiscal year 2025. Nvidia Investor PresentationNvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs high growth has been so impressive that the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs valuation (market cap) has exploded to more than $3 trillion, ranking it among the top three US companies (Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are the other two), and making Nvidia the single largest US company (depending on the day and stock price movements). Incredible, especially for a company that a lot of people on Main Street who have just recently learned about the company for the first time. And to add a little more perspective to Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs growth, you can see operating income per its main business segments, below. Nvidia Investor PresentationAs you can see above, it's Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs Data Center segment (i.e., √¢¬Ä¬úthe cloud√¢¬Ä¬ù) that's the largest and that has grown the most rapidly since the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. And perhaps most jaw dropping is Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs insane growth in free cash flow in the last two years (impressive). Nvidia Investor PresentationTotal Addressable Market (TAM): And if you're wondering whether or not Nvidia can keep growing (after its recent historic climb), the answer is a resounding long-term yes √¢¬Ä¬îas evidenced by the massive $1 trillion TAM opportunity (see table below). Nvidia Investor PresentationNvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs total revenue for fiscal year 2024 was a whopping $60.9 billion (see earlier chart), but that amount is exceeded by the opportunity that exists in gaming alone (see chart above), as well as Data Center Systems, Enterprise Cloud, Autonomous Machines and more (all separately, and collectively the potential is even more). Nvidia has the potential to keep growing rapidly for many years into the future.   market.usAnd as a side note, worth mentioning, Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs parallel processing has also expanded into crypto mining (an industry that could have continued high growth), not to mention the potential for yet-to-be discovered future initiatives and use cases for Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs chips. The market opportunity is massive, growing and not going away. Valuation Just because Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs stock price is up so much, that doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt mean the growth is over. To the contrary, Nvidia still trades at a very low valuation, depending on what multiples you look at and who you talk to. For example, as you can see in the table below, Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs forward PEG ratio (price/earnings to growth) is even lower (more attractive) than other top companies, like Apple, Amazon (AMZN) Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Microsoft. StockRover(MSFT) (AAPL) (TSLA) (AVGO) (QCOM) (MU) (SMCI) (MPWR) (PSTG) Some investors will argue Nvidia is simply too expensive on a traditional price-to-earnings multiple (72.1x P/E, 45.6x Fwd P/E), but Nvidia isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt exactly your granddad√¢¬Ä¬ôs blue-chip slow-growth dividend stock (we√¢¬Ä¬ôre not talking about some boring utility stock here). Nonetheless, Nvidia does have extraordinary financial health. For example, we saw the powerful free cash flow generation earlier, and the company held $31.4 billion in cash and investments as of last quarter (with only $9.7 billion in total debt, short and long term, combined). And its margins (see earlier chart) are astounding (i.e., a 43% net margins are extremely impressive). Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs financial strength will allow it to fund growth, potential acquisitions, and continuing shareholder cash returns (mainly through share repurchases, but the company does also maintain a very minimal dividend too). Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs Competitive Advantages (Moat): Superior GPUs: For starters, Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs competitive advantage stems from its superior GPUs. Others have attempted to compete on the GPU front (mainly AMD (AMD) as well as Intel (INTC)), but they have fallen short so far. Big tech companies have also attempted to create in-house chips, but have not yet had much success as compared to Nvidia GPUs. First-Mover Advantage: Nvidia also has a first mover advantage as developers are familiar with Nvidia, making it harder for new entrants to compete. There are also switching costs associated with alternative chips. Nvidia chips are the gold standard (and basically a necessity) for data centers and AI, and Nvidia chips remain in high demand from industry giants like Microsoft, Meta and Google (more on these customers later). Also, Tesla recently switched from its own internal chips to a massive cluster of Nvidia H100 AI chips for its autonomous-driving initiatives (in a sign of Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs strong competitive advantage). Cuda Software: Nvidia developed its Cuda software platform early on, which helps developers build with Nvidia chips. So even if AMD develops a competitive GPU, the switching costs (away from Cuda) for developers would be great and thereby widen Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs advantage (""moat"") over competitors. Jensen Huang: Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs founder/CEO, Jensen Huang, has driven the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs success. And he appears to have zero desire to step down (a good thing). According to a Business Insider article: At an age when some billionaire tech founders step away from the stress of leading big companies, the 58-year-old Jensen Huang (he is now 61), Nvidia's CEO, isn't thinking about retirement anytime soon. Bill Gates left the day-to-day operations at Microsoft at 52, and Jeff Bezos just retired from atop Amazon at 57. Jensen Huang is an absolute competitive advantage for Nvidia, but even if he were to step down, the company has already built such a lead and competitive advantages that the high long-term growth trajectory would be hard to disrupt, especially considering the cloud and AI megatrends have so much more room to run.  Red Flags (Big Risks): Despite all of the truly impressive things Nvidia has going on, there are red flags that investors should consider. Customer Concentration Have you ever wondered who is spending all the money behind Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs massive revenue growth? The answer is the only entities that are capable of spending that much√¢¬Ä¬îbig tech. Big tech is building cloud and AI infrastructure to support the needs of its public and private (government) customers. For example, a single customer made up 19% of its total revenue in fiscal year 2024. UBS says it√¢¬Ä¬ôs Microsoft. And according to the same article, Bloomberg data estimates that is followed by Meta Platforms (META) at 13% of revenue, Amazon at 6% of revenue, and Alphabet at about 6% of revenue too. Nvidia discloses in its annual report √¢¬Ä¬úrisk factors√¢¬Ä¬ù:    We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers√¢¬Ä¬¶  One indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, Compute and Networking segment.  If any large customers pullback significantly on chip spending, that can have a very negative impact on Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs business and share price. Cyclicality: A History of Big Declines Despite the market√¢¬Ä¬ôs current love affair with Nvidia, chip stocks have a history of big price declines. For example, since 2000, Nvidia shares have declined more than 50% four times. YChartsAnd this most recent upcycle has been driven by big tech customer spending. For example, Meta shares declined after its previous earnings announcement because the market was not pleased with CEO Mark Zuckerberg√¢¬Ä¬ôs enormous spending on Nvidia chips. Zuckerberg is trying to get ahead of demand, and it seems unreasonable to believe he will continue this massive level of spending (on Nvidia chips) quarter after quarter. And realistically, there aren√¢¬Ä¬ôt any other large customers that can step in and fill the future chip purchasing void when big tech takes a break to implement strategies using the Nvidia chips they√¢¬Ä¬ôve already purchased. Generally speaking, even 100 large cap companies (say $12 billion market cap each) can√¢¬Ä¬ôt make up for one Meta ($1.3 trillion market cap). According to the risk disclosures (emphasis ours) in Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs annual report: Failure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results. Tough Financial Comparisons and Growth Assumptions When Wall Street analysts determine share price targets for high-growth companies, the most impactful factor is their future growth assumptions. Even a small change to these assumptions can have a dramatic impact on their company valuations. According to Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs annual report: Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. In the quarters ahead, Nvidia will face extremely difficult historical revenue comparisons. As a business, Nvidia still has massive long-term growth, but to believe they can maintain the recent high revenue growth numbers consistently, quarter after quarter, is unrealistic. Wall Street analysts can be pretty smart and clever, but they don√¢¬Ä¬ôt have working crystal balls. And if Nvidia disappoints, even by just a small amount, as compared to recent historical comparison numbers and estimates, the shares can get very volatile (to the downside) fast. Macroeconomic Risks: Macroeconomic factors could have a significant negative impact on Nvidia. For example:  Third-Party Suppliers: Nvidia depends on third-party suppliers and manufacturers, and they cannot control their quantity, quality, and delivery schedules. In fact, most of Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs chip production is completed by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) at their Taiwan-based factories. Geopolitics: Nvidia chips are critically important to the functioning of the global economy (to the level that significant disruption poses a national security risk). And any geopolitical disruption (for example, tensions with China over Taiwan) could have a very negative impact on business. As another (smaller) example, recent export control measures blocked the passage of Nvidia products and services into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine.  AI Restrictions: According to Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs annual report: √¢¬Ä¬úThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.√¢¬Ä¬ù Potential AI restrictions pose a significant risk to Nvidia. Conclusion We believe Nvidia shares will be trading dramatically higher at some point in the future. Specifically, its leadership position is just too great, and the cloud and AI megatrends are just too powerful. Despite the risks, over the next decade, Nvidia shares are going much higher. In the near term, the shares are volatile. And depending on your personal situation, it could be in your best interest to stay the heck away. At the very least, now is a good time to consider rebalancing your portfolio, especially if Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs weight has ballooned. Yet for others, the best policy is to simply let your winners run.  At the end of the day, you need to do what is right for you, based on your own personal situation. Disciplined, goal-focused, long-term investing continues to be a winning strategy. -If you are looking for big-yield opportunities, consider our new July report: Top 10 Big-Yields: BDCs, CEFs, REITs, plus our 27-position Blue Harbinger High Income NOW portfolio (9.2% aggregate yield).You can access both at a discounted price as part of our 4th of July Sale.-Learn More, Get Instant Access.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

ysoKLPf7tR6uofG,The Motley Fool,bing,5 Low-Cost Vanguard ETFs for a Lifetime of Passive Income,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/04/5-low-cost-vanguard-etfs-lifetime-passive-income/,2024-07-04 05:25,2024-07-04 05:38,MSFT,,"Vanguard has over 85 exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but not all of them focus on equities. Many target bonds and risk-free assets like U.S. Treasuries.It's hard for an equity ETF to compete with a bond fund on yield alone. However, top ETFs reward investors with passive income and potential capital gains.Here's why the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV 0.07%), Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM 0.14%), Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG 0.11%), Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC -0.21%), and Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU 0.63%) are five excellent choices for generating a lifetime of passive income while getting diversified exposure to a variety of companies.Image source: Getty Images.1. Vanguard Value ETFWith a mere 0.04% expense ratio, 342 holdings, and a 2.3% dividend yield, the Vanguard Value ETF is perhaps one of the simplest and lowest-cost ways to generate passive income.The fund excludes top growth names like Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla¬†-- which are all holdings of the Vanguard Growth ETF.Since the start of 2023, the Vanguard Value ETF has been smoked by the S&P 500 and the Vanguard Growth ETF -- which is up a mind-numbing 77% in just 18 months as megacap growth stocks have carried the broader indexes to new heights. But long-term investors know that just about any trend can enamor markets over the medium term.VTV Total Return Level data by YChartsRisk-averse investors looking to limit volatility will appreciate the consistency of the Vanguard Value ETF. The fund's top holdings are Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, JPMorgan Chase, ExxonMobil, and UnitedHealth. Aside from Broadcom -- which has been on a tear along with most of the semiconductor industry -- these companies are unlikely to see their stock prices increase several-fold over the short term. However, many holdings in the fund pay stable and growing dividends or reward shareholders with stock buybacks -- which is Berkshire Hathaway's preferred method for returning capital to shareholders.Add it all up, and the ETF is a great way to invest in the broader market through a value lens. This may be a particularly effective strategy for investors who don't want to pay a premium price for growth stocks.2. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETFThe Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF has many holdings similar to the Value ETF. The key difference is that each holding must pay a dividend -- with a big emphasis on consistent dividend raises. So companies that are great value stocks but don't pay dividends (like Berkshire Hathaway) are excluded from the fund.With 556 holdings, the High Dividend Yield ETF has more holdings than the Value ETF. As expected, it has a higher yield at 2.8%. But still, a yield under 3% may come as a surprise for a fund labeled as ""high-yield.""However, it's worth understanding that outsized market gains typically lead to lower dividend yields. If a company's stock price increases at a faster rate than its dividend, the yield will go down. For example, Walmart announced a 9% dividend raise in February -- its largest increase in over a decade. But the stock is up a blistering 28.9% year to date -- making it the best-performing component in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- even better than growth stocks like Amazon and Microsoft. As a result, Walmart's dividend yield has gone down -- but investors would certainly trade a massive capital gain for a percentage point or two of yield.Plenty of stocks like Walmart in the High Dividend Yield ETF have undergone valuation expansions over the last few years -- benefiting investors with capital gains but lowering their dividend yields. So, the High Dividend Yield ETF doesn't yield as much as it used to -- but it is still an excellent source of passive income for investors looking for diversification and industry-leading companies.3. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETFThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF focuses on growth, income, and value stocks alike. Its objective is to find companies with a track record of increasing their payouts with less emphasis on valuation or yield.The top holdings in the fund are Apple and Microsoft, which are noticeably absent from the Value ETF and High Dividend Yield ETF. Despite both yielding less than 0.7%, Apple has raised its dividend every year since 2012¬†while Microsoft has increased its dividend at an average rate of over 10% per year for the last 10 years. That's a far faster pace of increase than ultra-safe dividend-paying stalwarts like Coca-Cola¬†or Procter & Gamble.The Dividend Appreciation ETF is a great choice for investors who care more about earnings growth and where a dividend is heading rather than where it has been or what a stock yields today.4. Vanguard Consumer Staples ETFThe Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF mirrors the performance of the consumer staples sector. Top holdings include Procter & Gamble, Costco Wholesale, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo. At 0.10%, the fund has a slightly higher expense ratio than some of Vanguard's other funds, but that's still just $1 for every $1,000 invested.One of the greatest benefits of investing in the consumer staples sector is its resilience during recessions and relatability. Consumer staples companies are less impacted by economic cycles than consumer discretionary companies that depend on consumers buying things they don't regularly need. During a recession, consumers are more likely to cut spending on an expensive vacation or high-priced item than toothpaste or paper towels.Even if you're new to investing, chances are you're familiar with many top consumer staples holdings. You may not know Coca-Cola owns Topo Chico, BodyArmor, and Simply juices and drinks. But chances are, you're generally aware of the business model.Consumer staples' easy-to-understand nature, paired with earnings consistency no matter the market cycle, makes it the perfect sector for risk-averse investors looking to generate income from familiar companies.5. Vanguard Utilities ETFLike consumer staples, utility companies tend to be relatively recession-resistant compared to other sectors. In terms of budgeting, cutting electricity or water consumption is likely further down the list than reducing discretionary purchases.Utilities benefit from growing consumption and population growth. The higher the demand for commodities like electricity, gas, and water, the greater the need for infrastructure expansions to boost supply.In this vein, utilities may be a better option than a bond or risk-free rate. Many top holdings in the Vanguard Utilities ETF work with agencies and regulators to set prices and pass along profits to shareholders. A single utility may be vulnerable to a certain geographic market. But a portfolio of utilities is a great way to earn a stable yield while still being invested in the market.The Vanguard Utilities ETF has a 3% yield -- which is higher than the High Dividend Yield ETF. While the fund is unlikely to outperform the major indexes during a bull market, it does stand a good chance to be less volatile if there is a major sell-off or correction.A hands-off approach to generating passive incomeThere are many different ways to target passive income in the stock market. Some investors prefer companies with limited growth prospects that use dividends as the primary way to pass along profits to shareholders. Others may look for companies that have increased their payouts every year for several decades.These five ETFs provide worthy starting points for investors looking to generate passive income with a focus on diversification.One of the best ways to invest in ETFs is to pair them with individual stock holdings. If you already have a lot of exposure to top value names, the Dividend Appreciation ETF could be a good way to tap into some growth stocks while still focusing on companies that are growing their dividends. A sector ETF in consumer staples or utilities could be a good choice if you don't already own top companies in these sectors.Ultimately, the best decision will depend on what's in your portfolio, your risk tolerance, and your investment objectives. No matter which ETF you choose (if any), you can rest easy knowing these Vanguard funds charge ultra-low fees.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

A mere 18 months later, it's now worth $3.1 trillion, making it the world's third-largest company behind Microsoft and Apple.Nvidia designs the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which developers use to build, train, and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) models. In the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), those chips sent the company's data center revenue skyrocketing 427% year over year to a record $22.6 billion.Nvidia is now spreading some of that wealth by investing in smaller AI companies, a strategy that supports the industry's growth and could lead to a nice return for its own shareholders if the bets pay off.Nvidia headquarters. Image source: Nvidia.The four stocks Nvidia ownsAccording to Nvidia's latest form 13F, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, the chipmaker holds a stake in the following AI companies:Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM), which built the architecture most semiconductor companies use to design their chips.SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), which develops voice recognition and conversational AI software.Nano-X Imaging, which uses AI to produce better results from medical imaging.Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which uses AI to aid in drug discovery.It invested in each company at the end of 2023. Arm Holdings received the largest investment at around $147 million, which is more than Nvidia deployed into the other three stocks combined. Today, that Arm position is worth $311 million thanks to a 130% gain in the stock in 2024 already.Nvidia invested around $3.7 million in SoundHound AI, and its stock has climbed 87% year to date, which now places that value at $6.7 million.Arm and SoundHound are the standout performers, and here's why that could continue.Arm HoldingsNvidia tried to buy Arm for $40 billion in 2020, but it was forced to abandon the deal because regulators said it was anticompetitive. It's no surprise, because Arm built the architecture that many leading semiconductor makers use to design their chips -- including Nvidia and one of its closest competitors, Advanced Micro Devices.Arm specializes in central processing units (CPUs), which are used in personal computers (PCs), smartphones, and even some of the GPUs designed by Nvidia to increase efficiency. Its upcoming GB200, for example, is configured with a combination of two GPUs and two Arm-based CPUs, and it's capable of inferencing AI models at five times the speed of its flagship H100, which currently dominates the data center market. This will drive costs down for developers, who often pay for computing capacity on a by-the-minute basis.Story continuesAn estimated 99% of smartphone CPUs also use Arm's architecture, so the company is overwhelmingly dominant in that segment. Plus, Microsoft is integrating AI into the Windows operating system, which is triggering a new wave of demand for next-generation chips from computer manufacturers. Arm CEO Rene Haas believes his company can capture a 50% share of the Windows PC market within five years.The company likely has a bright future, but investors should be wary of its lofty valuation before they rush to buy the stock. It generated $3.2 billion in revenue during fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), and based on its market capitalization of $169.8 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 53.That makes it even more expensive than Nvidia stock, with its P/S ratio of 38.7. Keep in mind, Nvidia is expected to nearly double its revenue in its current fiscal 2025, whereas Arm is projected to grow its revenue by just 23%. It doesn't make much sense to pay a higher valuation for Arm relative to Nvidia, when Arm is growing at a much slower pace.Nvidia bought Arm stock at a much cheaper price than where it trades today, so it might be best for investors to wait for a pullback before joining the party.SoundHound AISoundHound AI developed a suite of conversational AI software tools that have been deployed by businesses in the hospitality, restaurant, and automotive industries. They can hold entire spoken conversations with a user, making them extremely useful in high-pressure settings where fast answers are required to serve customers.The restaurant industry is using SoundHound's new Employee Assist tool to give workers a helpful virtual assistant they can call upon at any time. It understands store policies, and it can even offer employees guidance when making menu items. The technology is also used to take customer orders in a drive-thru lane, over the phone, and in a store.White Castle, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Krispy Kreme are just some of the chains using it. With help from its acquisition of restaurant AI company SYNQ3, SoundHound is now in 10,000 locations with 100,000 more in the pipeline, and management says its addressable market includes 1 million restaurants and 30 million other businesses across North America. So the company has barely scratched the surface of an opportunity that could be worth $100 billion.SoundHound's in-car voice assistant is used by leading automotive brands like Honda, Hyundai, and Stellantis (which owns Jeep, Dodge, and Chrysler). And the company recently partnered with Nvidia's Drive platform to refine the voice assistant by delivering it on the edge, which means users won't need network connectivity to access it. That improves privacy and enables it to work even in geographic areas with no network service.SoundHound generated $11.6 million in revenue during the recent fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended March 31), representing 73% growth from the year-ago period. Its order backlog also soared 80% to a record $682 million, so there is plenty of demand in the pipeline. Considering its stock trades at a P/S of 19.5, it looks like a much better value than Arm.However, SoundHound lost $33 million during the first quarter.

vg3gwFgfpri6v4D,CNBC,google,SoftBank stock hits its first record high in 24 years ‚Äî Arm and AI helped it get there,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/softbank-shares-hit-record-high-after-24-years-on-arm-and-ai-boost.html,2024-07-04 05:31,2024-07-04 05:46,ARM,,"SoftBank shares closed at a record high of 11,190.00 Japanese yen on Thursday, eclipsing the previous intraday high of 11,000 yen reached on Feb. 15, 2000.The Japanese giant has been given a boost by the public market success of British chip designer Arm, in which it has a majority stake.SoftBank 's massive tech investment arm, the Vision Fund, has posted better financial results amid a broader recovery in tech stocks. SoftBank Group shares hit a record high on Thursday, just as the company's massive tech investment arm shows signs of recovery and its outspoken founder Masayoshi Son emerged back into the public spotlight to align the Japanese giant to a future in artificial intelligence.The firm has also been helped by the public market success of British chip designer Arm, in which Softbank has a majority stake.Shares of the Japanese giant closed at a record high of 11,190.00 Japanese yen on Thursday ‚Äî a far cry from the dotcom crash of the early 2000s and a more recent downturn for the company during the tech market troubles of 2021 and 2022. Son founded SoftBank in 1981, back when the company distributed software. It went public in Japan in 1994, and, amid the internet boom, made a $2 million investment in Yahoo in the middle of that decade. That started off the company's tech investments.The rise of the internet and of Yahoo pushed SoftBank's stock to a peak closing price of 10,111.1 yen on Feb. 18, 2000. Three days prior, the firm's shares had hit an intraday high of 11,000 yen.As internet stocks came crashing down, so too did SoftBank's share price, which at one point sank more than 90% below its dotcom peak.It wasn't until nearly 21 years later, on Feb. 16, 2021, that SoftBank exceeded its previous record-high close. The recent rise to a share price peak has been volatile since Son positioned SoftBank as a visionary pioneer with the 2017 launch of a massive technology investment arm ‚Äî the Vision Fund.SoftBank made dozens of bets on tech companies across the world, some of which turned sour. Office sharing startup WeWork was perhaps among the highest-profile names. But some of SoftBank's investments in Chinese firms also took a hit after Beijing kicked off its crackdown on the domestic tech sector at the end of 2020.After lingering near then-record highs in March 2021, SoftBank's stock fell sharply, alongside other global tech stocks. The Vision Fund posted then-record¬†financial losses in 2022. Son said that SoftBank would go into ""defense"" mode and be more conservative with its investments. He changed tack shortly after the¬†Vision Fund posted a record $32 billion loss in 2023, saying that the company would now shift into ""offense,"" because he was excited about the investment opportunities in AI. SoftBank's share price began a recovery from around May 2023, and the Japanese titan's Vision Fund more recently posted better financials amid broader tech stock recoveries.""Softbank Vision Fund had to write down various investments due to a combination of equity values declining and a tougher private financing environment. It looks like the write down cycle is mostly done, and there is a good chance that the IPO market will be more constructive going forward, especially for AI related investments,"" Oliver Matthew, head of Asian consumer research at CLSA, told CNBC by email. Several analysts attributed SoftBank's recent share price bump of around 78% in the year to date to the IPO success of Arm, which it acquired in 2016.SoftBank owns roughly 90% of Arm even after the listing. Arm shares are up nearly 124% alone this year, as of the close on July 3.""SoftBank Group's investment strategy and focus has long included the development of an AI ecosystem portfolio, long before the LLM (large language model)-driven bull cycle in AI-related names over the last 18 months or so,"" Paul Golding, senior U.S. lifestyle and payments analyst at Macquarie U.S. equity research, told CNBC by email.""This vision, in our view, likely drove some of the investment decision in 2016 to acquire Arm, giving SoftBank Group direct exposure to semiconductor market dynamics and ownership of intellectual property around semiconductor design well ahead of broader progress in AI use-cases and platforms.""SoftBank shares ""have been benefitting from this vis-√†-vis well-publicized"" uses for Arm intellectual property, such as in the automotive industry or cloud data center, Golding added. Over the years, investors have focused on whether SoftBank Group's valuation fairly reflects the assets it is invested in or holds.For example, SoftBank's valuation is around $101.5 billion. Arm's market capitalization is around $176 billion ‚Äî meaning that SoftBank's 90% stake is equivalent to about $158 billion of that figure. That alone is significantly above SoftBank Group's overall valuation, without taking into account the company's other holdings and businesses, such as its telecommunications arm.Analysts cite this as a reason why SoftBank's share price does not reflect its fair value.Dan Baker, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said a lot of SoftBank's price appreciation comes down to Arm.""I'm not sure that investors are convinced by the SoftBank story again,"" Baker told CNBC by email, adding that this year's share gain is ""primarily"" because Arm stock has risen, while the Japanese yen has weakened. Baker said it is worth looking at the so-called sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation, which ascribes value to the various parts of SoftBank's holdings to figure what the company is worth. Baker said the SOTP valuation remains just under 50% this year, meaning SoftBank's stock does not truly reflect the value of its various businesses and investments.""So I'm not sure that investors are 'buying the SoftBank story' but investors are certainly buying the ARM story,"" Baker said.Investors have also cheered the fact that SoftBank has sold practically all of its shares in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that Son backed in 2000.SoftBank has also likely been helped by a recent broader rise in Japanese stocks, with the Nikkei 225 Index up 22% this year alone as of Thursday. But can Son's focus on AI boost SoftBank's value further and close the discount to its basket of assets?The SoftBank founder, who has been out of the public spotlight in the last year, recently spoke about his excitement over the future of AI and how SoftBank can be at the center of this technology with its investment in companies like Arm.Son last month laid out his vision for a world featuring what he dubbed as artificial super intelligence, or ASI, which would be 10,000 times smarter than humans.It comes at a time when investors are feverishly looking at how to play the AI boom, with the parabolic rise of Nvidia's stock price underscoring the excitement around the technology. CLSA's Matthew said SoftBank's discount could reduce, going forward, thanks to some of the company's early AI investments.""Softbank has been absolutely consistent about its investment direction; they were among the earliest investors behind the AI theme, and in some ways too early so many investors thought they were overpaying, or buying into certain companies where it wasn't clear how AI was related,"" Matthew said.""As a result, Softbank Group shares trade at a surprisingly wide discount to its fair value, and we believe this discount will narrow in the future.""",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

The executive made slight adjustments after companies identified minor calculation errors in the initial disclosure.ADVERTISEMENTBeijing said then it would take ""all necessary measures"" to safeguard China's interests.These could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of products such as cognac or pork.The EU anti-subsidy investigation has nearly four more months to run.At the end of it, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, could propose ""definite duties"", typically applying for five years, on which EU members would vote.China's commerce ministry said on Thursday both sides have so far held several rounds of technical talks over tariffs on the issue.""There is still a four-month window before arbitration, and we hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,"" He Yadong, a ministry spokesperson, said.BYD will face duties of 17.4%, Geely 19.9% and SAIC 37.6%, the EU said on Thursday. These are on top of the EU's standard 10% duty on car imports.Companies deemed by the EU to have cooperated with the anti-subsidy investigation, including western carmakers Tesla and BMW, will be subject to 20.8% tariffs and those that did not cooperate a rate of 37.6%.Story continuesThe Commission has estimated Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8% from below 1% in 2019 and could reach 15% in 2025. It says prices are typically 20% below those of EU-made models.European policymakers are keen to avoid a repeat of what happened with solar panels a decade ago, when the EU took only limited action to curb Chinese imports and many European manufacturers collapsed. The EU launched its anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs last October.The Chinese Passenger Car Association has said the tariffs will have only a modest impact on the majority of Chinese firms.The rates are far lower than the 100% tariff Washington plans to apply to Chinese EV imports from August.(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop, Charlotte Van Campenhout; Editing by Catherine Evans and Barbara Lewis)",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
EWzuKWcXeibBVxo,The Motley Fool,google,Billionaire Bill Ackman's Best-Performing Stocks of 2024 So Far: Are They Still Buys?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/04/billionaire-bill-ackman-best-stocks-2024-buys/,2024-07-04 05:46,2024-07-04 05:49,GOOGL,,"Andrew Carnegie is credited as saying, ""The way to become rich is to put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket.""Bill Ackman has amassed a net worth of over $9 billion by following a modified version of the strategy. All his Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund's assets are currently invested in only eight stocks -- two of which are different classes of shares for the same company.Despite having a small number of holdings, Ackman has several big winners this year. Here are the billionaire hedge fund manager's best-performing stocks of 2024 so far.1. Chipotle Mexican GrillChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 0.29%) ranks as Ackman's top stock of the year. Shares of the restaurant chain operator are up nearly 34% year to date after soaring 65% in 2023.Ackman reduced Pershing Square's position in Chipotle by 9.8% in the first quarter. However, it remained the hedge fund's largest single holding at the end of the quarter, making up over 20% of Pershing Square's total portfolio.One key factor behind Chipotle's strong performance so far in 2024 is the company's solid growth. The company reported Q1 revenue jumped 14% year over year to $2.7 billion, and its adjusted earnings per share soared 27% to $13.37.Chipotle also generated excitement in March when it announced a 50-for-1 stock split. The company conducted this big split after the market close on June 25, 2024.2. AlphabetGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOG 0.42%) (GOOGL 0.31%) trails slightly behind Chipotle as Ackman's second-best performer so far in 2024. The tech giant's shares have vaulted 31% higher this year.Pershing Square owns both Alphabet's class A and class C shares. At the end of Q1, they made up 6.1% and 13.3%, respectively, of the hedge fund's total portfolio.The generative AI boom has provided a nice tailwind for Alphabet's Google Cloud business. In Q1, the unit's revenue increased more than 28% to $9.6 billion.Most of Alphabet's revenue, though, is generated from its other operations -- primarily Google Search and YouTube. These businesses also continue to perform well, with total Google Services revenue rising nearly 14% year over year in Q1 to $70.4 billion.3. Hilton Worldwide HoldingsAckman's No. 3 stock of 2024, with less than six months remaining in the year, might be surprising. Shares of hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT 0.24%) are up 18% year to date.Technically, Hilton was Pershing Square's second-largest holding at the end of Q1. However, with the class A and class C shares of Alphabet combined, it would have been the hedge fund's third-largest position.Hilton's revenue increased 12% year over year in Q1 to $2.3 billion. Its earnings jumped nearly 29% higher to $265 million, or $1.04 per diluted share.Are they still buys?I'd be leery of buying Chipotle after the stock's impressive run. The Mexican restaurant chain's shares trade at a sky-high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 56.8. That lofty level is hard to justify with Chipotle's growth.Hilton Worldwide Holdings also appears to be a bit pricey. Its forward earnings multiple is 30.3. Again, I don't think Hilton's growth prospects warrant this valuation.That leaves Alphabet. It isn't cheap, either, with shares trading at 24.3 times forward earnings. Some investors could be worried that artificial intelligence (AI) presents an existential threat to the company's search business.However, Ackman said last year that Alphabet ""will be a dominant player in AI for the very, very long term."" I agree with his take. I like the opportunities for Google Cloud and the Waymo self-driving car technology business. Of Ackman's three biggest winners of 2024 so far, Alphabet is the best pick for long-term investors, in my view.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
k77oy4PhH3jVAQX,The Motley Fool,bing,3 Incredible FAANG Stocks You'll Want to Consider Adding to Your Portfolio in July,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/04/incredible-faang-stocks-add-to-portfolio-july/,2024-07-04 05:45,2024-07-04 05:54,AAPL,,"It's been a while since the term ""FAANG stocks"" captured investors' attention, mostly because these stocks aren't the red-hot names they used to be. The so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" tickers have taken their place as the market's hot-button grouping.The thing is, all five FAANG stocks are still incredible investments, and three of them are standout prospects you'll want to consider adding to your portfolio sooner rather than later.¬†1. AmazonMost investors know Amazon (AMZN -1.21%) has (literally) been the market's most rewarding stock over the past three decades; shares are up more than 260,000% since their 1997 initial public offering. Most investors also understand, however, that the e-commerce giant's highest-growth days are in the past. It's simply too big now to continue growing at its historical pace.That doesn't mean its future isn't bright, however. It's just different in a handful of compelling ways.One of these ways is a relatively new, intense focus on profitability. Although the company has historically been more interested in expanding its footprint than turning a profit, for the past couple of years it's been closing and canceling warehouses that couldn't operate as cost-effectively as needed. It's streamlining all of its operations to cull costs.And it's working! While its first-quarter top line improved 13% year over year, operating income more than tripled. Notably, its international e-commerce operation swung from a regular loss to an operating profit of $900 million. That's the best this arm's done since early 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing.Data source: Amazon Chart by author. Figures are in billions.Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, is also firing on all cylinders, bouncing back from soaring operating expenses seen in late 2022 and 2023. Its first-quarter operating income of $9.4 billion is record-breaking and continues to improve. Look for more of the same, too. Mordor Intelligence believes the cloud market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of more than 16% through 2029.Amazon's newest business is on a roll as well. That's advertising. Amazon.com's third-party sellers forked over $11.8 billion to more prominently feature their products at the website, up 24% year over year.Amazon shares are already up more than 130% since early last year, reaching new records just last week. Given the profit growth in the near-term and long-term cards though, there's more upside ahead for this FAANG stock.2. NetflixIt would be easy to assume the worst for streaming powerhouse Netflix (NFLX 0.43%). Suspiciously, after a clear slowdown in its customer growth, beginning next year the company will no longer disclose its subscriber numbers. The streaming market itself is also running into a saturation headwind, forcing its leading companies to partner up with peers and competitors to create more marketable bundles. Cable giant Comcast recently unveiled a cable TV package that included Netflix and Apple TV, for example, while Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are pairing up Disney+, Max, and Hulu in a bundle that will be priced at a discount and launched sometime this summer.Just because the crowded industry's maturing, however, doesn't mean Netflix is doomed. It's got a couple of key things working in its favor that could -- and should -- keep the stock's current rally going. One of them is the company's position within the streaming market.See, it's not just the original name in the business that gave rise to all the others. It's also still the most popular and ""stickiest"" streaming platform. Nearly 270 million households pay for access to its content ... far more than any of its rivals. Meanwhile, streaming market research house Antenna reports Netflix's customer churn rate stands at only 2%, versus more than 4% for Disney+ and over 6% for Max, for perspective. For most U.S. households that pay for multiple streaming services, a ""Netflix-first and then the others"" kind of mindset still prevails. Habits are powerful.The other matter working in Netflix's favor is the rise of ad-supported streaming services. While only about 40 million of its 270 million subscribers (roughly 15%) are paying a lower monthly price in exchange for watching the occasional television commercial, it's an option that will keep its service far more marketable for far longer than it might otherwise have been. Market research outfit Global Market Insight believes the ad-supported streaming market is set to grow at an annualized rate of more than 8% through 2032.3. AppleLast but not least, add Apple (AAPL 0.58%) to your list of FAANG stocks to consider buying before the end of July.It's not necessarily an easy name to get excited about owning right now. Although the stock was a must-have for years following 2007's debut of the iPhone, slowing iPhone sales -- which account for about half of Apple's revenue -- have prompted worries regarding its future growth.There's a huge new growth catalyst already at work though. That's artificial intelligence.While there's no denying the company was late to the party, it's catching up quickly. Last month Apple unveiled several different AI features for its smartphones, tablets, and computers that will make its wares even more powerful technology (particularly as it pertains to generative artificial intelligence). As Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang writes, ""Apple's introduction of Apple Intelligence will position the company as the leader in the consumer AI experience.""It's not just Apple's consumer-facing artificial intelligence apps that hold so much promise, however. The company's also working on tech that most consumers will never actually see in action firsthand. For instance, it's working on the development of its own chips for use in AI data centers. Although Nvidia's dominance of this market isn't in any immediate danger, The Wall Street Journal reports that these chips could be based on a completely different sort of artificial intelligence called inference rather than the training-oriented architecture that's common right now.It remains to be seen exactly what Apple's AI future looks like. But, Apple's got a long history of success. Given Precedence Research's prediction that the worldwide AI market is set to grow an average of 19% through 2032 there's little doubt the company will win at least its fair share of the market's expansion.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
L1jKMxfCqZBMKfc,The Motley Fool,google,Forget Eli Lilly: 3 Biotech Stocks to Buy Instead,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/04/forget-eli-lilly-3-biotech-stocks-to-buy-instead/,2024-07-04 05:50,2024-07-04 05:55,AMGN,,"A few years ago, Eli Lilly (LLY -0.95%) was far from the hottest stock in the biopharmaceutical world. But times have changed. Today, Lilly ranks as the biggest healthcare company in the world. It still has tremendous growth prospects with its diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease drugs.So is Lilly the top stock for healthcare investors right now? Nope. Forget Eli Lilly. Here are three biotech stocks to buy instead.1. AmgenYou might be surprised to see Amgen (AMGN -0.45%) on a list of better biotech stocks to buy than Eli Lilly. While Lilly's shares have soared more than 50% year to date, Amgen is up by only a high single-digit percentage. Amgen also posted a net loss in the first quarter of 2024 based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).However, Amgen blows Lilly away on one important front -- valuation. Its shares trade at less than 16.2 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, Lilly's forward earnings multiple is a sky-high 66.7.Sure, Lilly should have stronger growth prospects, thanks especially to soaring sales for Mounjaro and Zepbound. This puts the drugmaker's lofty valuation in perspective. But Amgen has pretty good growth opportunities as well: Ten of the company's products generated double-digit volume growth in the first quarter. The company also has a loaded pipeline, with 25 late-stage programs. Amgen trounces Lilly when it comes to dividends, too. Lilly's forward dividend yield is 0.6%, only a fraction of Amgen's yield of 2.9%.2. Vertex PharmaceuticalsMuch of Eli Lilly's anticipated growth is already baked into its share price, but I don't think that's the case for Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -0.74%). Granted, Vertex's forward earnings multiple of 29 is relatively high. However, its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a low 0.6, reflecting an attractive valuation.Some of Vertex's growth will come from its core cystic fibrosis (CF) market. The company enjoys a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of the rare genetic disease. It could soon expand that monopoly with the pending U.S. and European approvals of a triple-drug CF combo featuring vanzacaftor.Most of Vertex's growth, though, is likely to come from non-CF drugs. It's ramping up the commercial launch of Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The big biotech innovator could also win U.S. approval of suzetrigine in treating acute pain in the first half of 2025. Vertex is evaluating inaxaplin in a phase 3 study targeting APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD). There are no approved therapies that treat the underlying cause of AMKD, and it affects more patients than CF does. Vertex's pending acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences will give it another late-stage candidate, povetacicept, which targets the rare kidney disease IgA nephropathy. 3. Viking TherapeuticsUnlike Lilly, Amgen, and Vertex, Viking Therapeutics (VKTX -2.08%) doesn't have any approved products on the market yet. And Viking still isn't profitable. However, with a market cap of under $6 billion and a promising pipeline, this biotech stock could have the most room to run.Earlier this year, Viking announced spectacular results from a phase 2 study of its experimental obesity drug VK2735. The dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist achieved greater weight loss after 13 weeks of treatment than Lilly's tirzepatide (marked as Mounjaro and Zepbound) and Novo Nordisk's semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic and Wegovy) did in clinical trials. If VK2735 is successful in phase 3 testing and goes on to win regulatory approvals, Viking will almost certainly be worth much more than it is today. And this drug isn't the only potential huge winner in the company's pipeline. Viking's VK2809 is in phase 2 testing as a treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Some analysts predict that the NASH therapy market could top $100 billion, rivaling the obesity drug market.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

To some, this company appears to be significantly overvalued, with a price-earnings ratio of 568-times and a high PEG ratio of 6.9. Its intrinsic value estimates also vary, though it should be noted the run ARM stock has been on is indicative of improved growth expectations in the chip sector.The company‚Äôs focus is on providing unique IP to the semiconductor segment. Those looking to manufacture chips often need to go through Arm in one way or another. Thus, the company‚Äôs growth prospects really do align with the market giants in this space. With the run Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its peers have been on, this is clearly an even more meta picks-and-shovels play in the chip space many bulls are looking at.Here are the arguments for and against this megacap chip stock right now.The Nasdaq 100 and ARM StockOn June 24, Arm surged on news that this stock has been included in the Nasdaq 100 index. Arm replaced Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) across several Nasdaq 100 indexes.Nine months after Arm Holdings debuted on the market with the largest U.S. IPO since 2021, its American depositary receipts have continued to rocket higher. The company‚Äôs share price has surged from its $51 per share offer price to more than $163 per share at the time of writing. That‚Äôs a nice triple-up for investors in less than a year, and certainly warrants this inclusion in my view.Excellent Growth ProgressArm Holdings wasn‚Äôt cheap at its September IPO, trading flat until February. Positive catalysts since then drove its valuation sky-high. The company currently trades at around 554-times trailing 12 months GAAP earnings, 185-times GAAP forward earnings, and 103-times non-GAAP forward earnings. This starkly contrasts with sector norms, suggesting it may be overvalued for now.That said, on a sector-wide basis, this stock doesn‚Äôt look overly expensive. Analysts have remained bullish on this stock, in part because of the strong growth prospects seen in the data center, PC, IoT, and automotive sectors. Its market dominance in mobile and IoT, coupled with AI-driven opportunities, underscores its potential as a global computing leader with strong revenue growth and high margins (95.2% gross profit margin).Arm Holdings stock surged over 40% in February on optimism about AI, driven by quarterly results exceeding Wall Street expectations. If this AI surge continues, ARM stock could clearly be a key beneficiary. Also Invested in AIARM stock surged over 6% following reports that the company, known for designing chips for various applications including AI, outlined plans to develop its own AI chip division. The division aimed to create its first prototype by 2025. It remains unclear whether this initiative will result in a new stand-alone entity or be integrated within Arm under its parent company, SoftBank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY). Arm, seen as SoftBank‚Äôs key asset, also has plans to enter data center construction by 2026, focusing on renewable energy and leveraging its own chip technology.Arm‚Äôs recent AI advancements promise improved performance in AI, computing, and graphics. CEO Rene Haas projected 100 billion AI-ready Arm devices by 2025, boosting investor confidence.ARM Stock Looks Like a BuyRight now, I have to side with analysts on Arm Holdings. ARM stock does certainly look expensive, and there‚Äôs no getting around that. From a momentum perspective and in terms of robust long-term growth catalysts, there are few companies out there with the sort of tailwinds Arm has.I view this stock as an overarching way to play growth in the chips sector. For those looking to do so, I think the company‚Äôs recent addition to the Nasdaq 100 and other key AI-related catalysts could propel strong performance over the next year at least.

0fmnmUQ6Lo7tAhc,Investorplace,google,3 Crypto Stocks to Buy for 100% Returns as Bitcoin Consolidates,https://investorplace.com/2024/07/3-crypto-stocks-to-buy-for-100-returns-as-bitcoin-consolidates/,2024-07-04 06:03,2024-07-04 06:09,BTC,,"Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been in a consolidation zone after a big rally in the last 12 months. I expect some more consolidation between $60,000 and $70,000 before a fresh rally. It‚Äôs therefore a good time to look at some of the best crypto stocks to buy.It‚Äôs worth noting that the fed is likely to cut interest rates multiple times in the next 12 to 18 months. Expansionary policies would imply easy money and that‚Äôs the first catalyst for Bitcoin trending higher. Of course, with limited supply, the blue-chip crypto will trend higher on wider adoption of digital assets.Further, the current bull market for cryptocurrencies is far from being over. Peter Brandt is a well-known technical analyst and believes that Bitcoin‚Äôs ongoing bull market will peak at $200,000. This is likely to translate into multi-bagger returns for some of the best crypto stocks.Let‚Äôs therefore discuss three crypto stocks to buy that can surge by 100% in the next 12 months.Coinbase Global (COIN)Source: Primakov / Shutterstock.comThe trend in Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock for year-to-date is similar to that of Bitcoin. The crypto trading platform stock has remained sideways in the recent past as Bitcoin consolidates. I see this as a good accumulation opportunity and a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31x is attractive.In the last bull market, the peak euphoria was associated with a surge in trading and speculative activity. That‚Äôs still to come and will benefit Coinbase, which is among the largest centralized exchanges in the world.A key difference between the last bull market and now is the company‚Äôs geographical presence. Earlier, Coinbase was exclusively focused on the U.S. markets. However, with aggressive international expansion, the crypto exchange is present in 38 countries. Therefore, the revenue potential is significantly higher coupled with a bright free cash flow outlook.I must add here that Coinbase Prime, the company‚Äôs institutional trading platform, hit all-time highs in trading volume and the number of active clients in Q1 2024. This is another segment that‚Äôs likely to drive growth as the bull market rages in the coming quarters.Riot Platforms (RIOT)Source:  rafapress / Shutterstock.comAmong Bitcoin mining stocks, Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) seems massively undervalued. After a correction of 25% in the last 12 months, RIOT stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 13.4x. Considering the growth outlook, the valuation gap is significant.The first point to note is that Riot has strong fundamentals. The Bitcoin miner has a zero-debt balance sheet. Further, as of Q1 2024, the company reported a cash buffer (including Bitcoin holdings) of $1.3 billion. This positions Riot to pursue aggressive expansion.A big expansion is already underway. Riot reported a hash rate capacity of 12.5EH/s as of Q1 2024. The company is targeting to increase capacity to 31.5EH/s by the end of the year. As a low-cost Bitcoin miner, this expansion is likely to translate into robust revenue and EBITDA upside.Further, Riot has plans to increase capacity to 100EH/s by 2027. If the execution is good, RIOT stock will likely deliver multi-bagger returns from current levels. For now, I expect a sharp rally as new capacity boosts growth.Block (SQ)Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.comAmong fintech stocks to buy, Block (NYSE:SQ) looks attractive. After a big correction, SQ stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. I believe that a breakout on the upside is impending after this phase of consolidation. My view is underscored by the point that SQ stock trades at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 19x.One reason for investors ignoring Block is the impression that the company is significantly focused on Bitcoin and crypto. In the recent shareholder letter, Block clarified that only ‚Äú3% of company resources are dedicated to bitcoin-related projects.‚Äù As the adoption of Bitcoin increases and as blockchain technology is used across industries, it‚Äôs likely that Block will scale up investments towards crypto projects.It‚Äôs also worth noting that Block has been investing 10% of the gross profit from Bitcoin products each month into buying the cryptocurrency. As the value of Bitcoin increases, Block will benefit in the form of higher financial flexibility.The company‚Äôs Cash App has been a success with over 21 million active users buying, selling, or holding Bitcoin. As crypto is increasingly accepted as a payment method, the use of Cash App for Bitcoin transactions will increase and create value.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

gOeqgdJXOrLNtXf,The Motley Fool,google,Forget Chevron? Buffett Is Buying Up This Energy Stock Instead,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/04/forget-chevron-this-billionaire-buy-energy-stock/,2024-07-04 06:10,2024-07-04 06:12,CVX,,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.12%) (BRK.B -0.33%) has a massive portfolio of stocks, but two companies on the list that have made headlines lately are Chevron (CVX -0.03%) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY -0.06%). In the conglomerate's latest 13F filing on May 15, Buffett revealed that in the first quarter, he sold around 3.1 million shares of Chevron shares and added about 4.3 million shares to his Oxy position.Should you follow Buffett's lead? Buffett still owns a lot of ChevronBuffett didn't exit his position in Chevron (at the time of the filing he still owned more than $19 billion worth of Chevron's shares), so it isn't exactly like he dumped the stock so he could buy Oxy. But he did sell a material amount of Chevron and notably up his stake in Oxy (which was worth about $16 billion at the time of the filling). So it looks like he used the cash raised from the Chevron sale to fund the purchase of additional shares of Oxy. That said, investors in Chevron shouldn't dump it from their portfolios based on this shift.Image source: Motley Fool.In fact, particularly if you are a conservative income investor, you'll probably want to keep Chevron around. It has a rock-solid balance sheet and a broadly diversified business -- both geographically and within the energy sector. It has proven time and again that it knows how to survive every phase of the economic cycle in the highly volatile energy sector, where oil and natural gas prices can make dramatic and swift price moves. The clearest proof of that point is that Chevron has increased its dividend every year for 37 consecutive years.Equally important for those considering a new purchase now, Chevron's dividend yield is currently an attractive 4.1%. By contrast, at recent share prices, Occidental Petroleum's yield is just 1.4%. Clearly, if you are looking to maximize the income your portfolio generates, you won't want to make the change that Buffett just made. But if income isn't your top concern, the Oracle of Omaha's portfolio shift is worth considering.Buffett bought more Occidental PetroleumWarren Buffett's really big move with Occidental Petroleum came back in 2019 when he invested $10 billion in it directly to help provide financing for its purchase of Anadarko Petroleum. Somewhat ironically in retrospect, Oxy needed that extra cash so it could outbid Chevron. Things went south shortly thereafter for Occidental, since the economic shutdowns that nations around the world engaged in to slow the spread of the coronavirus in 2020 resulted in a steep drop in the price of oil. Occidental was forced to cut its dividend and redouble its efforts to strengthen its finances.It muddled through that difficult period and is now back on the growth track. Management is regularly raising the dividend again and the company has even gotten back into the acquisition game -- its $12 billion purchase of CrownRock is expected to close this quarter. Here's the really interesting comparison: Energy industry giant Chevron has a market cap of $280 billion while Occidental Petroleum's market cap is ""just"" $55 billion.Sure, neither company is exactly small, but Oxy will likely have an easier time expanding its business meaningfully than Chevron will. And Occidental is clearly attempting to act as an industry consolidator in an attempt to gain the scale it requires to compete with its larger peers. In this way, it is more of a growth story, and it looks like Buffett approves of the company's prospects. In fact, in June he went back for more, adding nearly 3 million more shares. If you are looking for an energy stock to add to your portfolio and you don't really care about income, then maybe you'll want to consider Buffett's recent decisions to favor Oxy over Chevron.You don't need to make a moveJust because a famous investor does something does not mean you should follow their lead. You have to make the calls that are best for you and your portfolio. If you are a conservative income investor, switching from Chevron to Occidental is probably a bad choice. But if you have more of a growth bent, or are seeking to build a portfolio that delivers a mix of growth and income, Buffett's shift highlights a key difference between giant Chevron and up-and-comer Oxy.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
xrNQ47ULJ5eEOdT,BBC,bing,EU hits Chinese electric cars with steep tariffs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy99z53qypko,2024-07-04 06:04,2024-07-04 06:15,TSLA,,"The European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, as Brussels takes action to protect the bloc's motor industry. The new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 17.4% to 37.6%, which is on top of a 10% duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from China. This could raise the price of EVs across the EU, making them less affordable for European consumers. The move is also a major blow for Beijing, which is already in a trade war with Washington. The EU is the largest overseas market for China‚Äôs EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy. EU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by ""unfair subsidisation"", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc. China has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports. The new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. So who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute? It is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels. By imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU‚Äôs decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU. The number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E). Patryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: ""I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46."" T&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027. But not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs. They were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely. SAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4. ""The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,"" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. For Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: ""I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty."" For China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU.  That is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will ""give the automaker an advantage in the European market"". Lu√≠s Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car. But, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because ""other brands would also be affected"". Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%. According to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will ""still export to the EU profitably"" but ""its profits will be significantly reduced."" Other firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU. Those deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%. US-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked  for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation. Still, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs.  Last year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y. Mr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen. ""Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,"" Mr Koopmann says.  ""If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision."" While some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe. The hardest hit ""will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,"" Rhodium says. ""The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault."" In other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers. There is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties. Work on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year. Chinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona. And, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe. ""It‚Äôs a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,"" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility. ""The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.""  The Chinese government placed its bet on EVs early on. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, between 2009 and 2023 more than $230bn (¬£181bn) of state support was pumped into the industry. As a result its EV industry has become world leading. The International Energy Agency says China accounted for more than 60% of the world's new electric car sales last year. While the vast majority of EVs produced in China are sold domestically, overseas markets, and particularly Europe, have become increasingly important. ""Exports are the profitable segment,"" said Rhodium's senior analyst, Gregor Sebastian. ""The EU tariffs will hurt China‚Äôs EV industry because these exports help recover losses from China's domestic price war."" Meanwhile, the world's second largest economy is struggling to shake off an economic slowdown in the wake of the pandemic and an ongoing property crisis. Faced with lower domestic consumption and investment levels, China is trying to ""export its way out"" of the slump, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis. And Beijing is placing yet another large bet on EVs by making the industry one of its ‚ÄúNew Three‚Äù growth drivers - a government blueprint for reviving the economy that also relies on exports of batteries and renewable energy. However, with major markets like the US, the EU and others imposing tariffs and other barriers, it looks like China's latest gamble could deepen trade tensions with some of its largest trading partners.

UntoRVg2XWTMqc7,The Motley Fool,google,Nvidia Stock Exploded in 2024: How to Protect Your Portfolio From a Reversal for the Rest of the Year,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/04/nvidia-stock-exploded-in-2024-how-to-protect-your/,2024-07-04 06:16,2024-07-04 06:18,NVDA,,"The onset of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) applications across many industries has vaulted Nvidia (NVDA 4.57%) into the spotlight among investors. That has led shares of the chipmaker to soar 150% in the first half of 2024. And that includes a retracement of nearly 10% in the final two weeks of June.The stock's upward trajectory began last year as Nvidia's data center sales soared. Shares have exploded in response, with a gain of 745% since the start of 2023. That raises the question of how much growth is built into the stock, and whether shares have run too far, too fast.Is it time to sell Nvidia?No stock goes up forever, as Nvidia's recent correction from its record high price reinforced. With even a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 45, any slowdown in earnings and sales growth will likely clobber the stock price.But the company is not just selling the most in-demand hardware for data center AI computing power. It is also integrating its CUDA computing platform and programming model software on its graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture. That's giving customers a more integrated solution and puts Nvidia another step ahead of any competition.The incredible demand for all the potential uses of AI has provided a long runway for the company to continue growing. But competition will inevitably increase, and either its sales growth or profit margins will peak.However, investors don't need to try to time that peak and sell shares to reap short-term gains. After all, Nvidia's long-term outlook remains bright, even if there is a plateau or drop in the stock in the back half of this year. Instead, investors can bolster other areas of a portfolio to protect against a nerve-racking drop.Balance your equity portfolioOne direction investors should go is to add a healthy dose of dividend-paying stocks to holdings. That steady income can provide needed ballast against a high-flying, volatile stock like Nvidia should it begin a free fall. It's also helpful to look outside of the tech sector to add diversity.Dividends have been a meaningful part of market returns over the years. In fact, since the 1940's, a decade-by-decade look shows that dividend income has contributed an average of 34% to the total return of the S&P 500 index.*Total return for the S&P 500 index in the 2000s was negative. Data sources: Morningstar and Hartford Funds. Image source: Hartford Funds.3 dividend stocks to buy nowWhen looking for dividends, one of the first sectors that comes to mind is real estate investment trusts (REITs). That's because REITs are required to return at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends in exchange for special tax advantages.One of the largest and best-known REITs is Realty Income (O 0.04%).¬†Calling itself The Monthly Dividend Company¬†for its payout schedule, the REIT has been diversifying its real estate holdings and geographies. Its share price was recently trading near a three-year low, even as its funds from operations were close to a high.O data by YCharts.One reason the share price lags right now is the competitive yield available from ultra-safe Treasury bills. But the REIT's 5.8% dividend yield will look more enticing if and when the Federal Reserve begins lowering interest rates. That is expected to begin as early as this year, making now a good time to buy into Realty Income.Another beneficiary of lower rates will be Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE: BIP) and its corporate-structured variant Brookfield Infrastructure Corp. (BIPC 0.50%). Brookfield is a proven allocator of capital but also relies on debt to grow its lucrative investment portfolio. Brookfield recently recycled some assets and used proceeds to acquire Triton International, the largest owner and lessor of intermodal containers. With prices for sea containers spiking, that purchase should provide more returns than originally anticipated.Other assets include a globally diversified mix of transportation infrastructure, utilities, energy transmission and storage, data centers, and cell towers. Brookfield also has a high dividend yield as its stock price has drifted lower in the current interest rate environment.BIP data by YCharts.Garmin (GRMN -0.21%) is a third stock to consider for added diversification. Its dividend pays a modest 1.8%, but the seller of GPS-enabled devices for outdoor enthusiasts provides exposure to the consumer products segment.It also has a history of steady dividend increases and a balance sheet flush with $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents. The company has no debt and a significant cash flow stream.That cash -- and cash flow -- provide a cushion that should help keep Garmin's dividend increasing in the future. The company has steadily increased its payout over the past decade, with the dividend rising by more than 50% over that time. And after it reported 20% sales growth in the first quarter, investors can likely expect management to boost full-year guidance if it has another solid report from the second quarterThe bottom line is that Nvidia might be overvalued right now, but trying to time selling at a short-term peak is a fool's errand. Its prospects warrant holding the stock for the long term with a long runway for its AI products as well as its other segments like technology for self-driving vehicles.Instead, investors should look at adding less-volatile dividend stocks that also have promising outlooks for the back half of 2024. In the end, that can help a stock portfolio grow without creating undo stress for investors.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Alarming Signs Investors Can't Ignore.,https://investorplace.com/market360/2024/07/is-intel-the-next-dow-dropout-the-alarming-signs-investors-cant-ignore/?utm_source=barchart&utm_medium=allother,2024-07-04 06:08,2024-07-04 06:19,INTC,,"Is Intel¬†(NASDAQ:INTC) underappreciated, or just underwhelming? Investors should be cautious when a stock fails to rally after positive news. Get the full story on troubled Intel stock before jumping in. We‚Äôre giving Intel a ‚ÄúD‚Äù grade and a vote of no-confidence.Ask yourself a few questions before we dive into the details. Do you believe in cutting losses and letting profits grow? Would you classify Intel as a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù or ‚Äúloser‚Äù in this case? Consider Intel as an investable business for H2 2024.Putting Your Chips on the Wrong ChipmakerOn a year-to-date basis, it seems like practically every large-cap chipmaker stock is in the green except for Intel¬†stock. This is the case despite what should have been a major catalyst for Intel.Think about how excited Intel‚Äôs struggling shareholders must have been when, earlier this year, the U.S. government¬†promised to give the company as much as $8.5 billion in grants. This will reportedly come from funding earmarked in 2022‚Äôs CHIPS and Science Act.Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger didn‚Äôt hesitate to gloat and promote:‚ÄúGo drive by the Ohio site ‚Ä¶ There are a whole lot of cranes and concrete job trucks that are building what we believe will become the premier manufacturing location, at scale, particularly for AI chips in America.‚ÄùGelsinger‚Äôs braggadocio was premature. Since the funding announcement, Intel stock has declined from $42 to $31. Furthermore, the tech-trade war between the U.S. and China has intensified.Also, let‚Äôs not forget that Intel¬†delayed its Ohio chip-factory project earlier this year. In addition, the company is reportedly halting its plan to establish a chipmaking factory in Israel.Will Intel Get Booted From the Dow?We could go on and on about Intel‚Äôs problems in 2024. Among the most worrisome issues are the fierce competition from Intel‚Äôs rivals in the chipmaker industry, as well as the high cost of establishing a chip-foundry business.It could take years for Intel to achieve a good return on its foundry-business investment. As InvestorPlace contributor Tyrik Torres pointed out, Intel‚Äôs foundry manufacturing unit ‚Äúgenerated¬†$18.9 billion in revenue (a 30% decrease from 2022)‚Äù and ‚Äúreported $7 billion worth of operating losses in 2023, which had expanded upon the $5.2 billion loss figure of 2022.‚ÄùAll of this begs a question that Intel stock optimists probably don‚Äôt want to ask: Will Intel be removed from the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average? We invite you to look through the current list of Dow companies. Can you think of some companies ‚Äî including a chipmaker or two ‚Äî that might replace Intel?If so, then you can certainly see the writing on the wall. It would be a harsh blow, psychologically speaking, to Intel‚Äôs loyal investors if the company gets kicked off the Dow. Moreover, Intel stock would be removed from Dow-tracking index funds. What a shame that would be, since Intel was once a highly revered and seemingly untouchable tech titan.Intel Stock: Not an Underdog, but Just an UnderachieverThis year so far, Intel‚Äôs shareholders are falling behind the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Undoubtedly, this is frustrating as the CHIPS Act news seemed like a game-changing catalyst for Intel.Thus, we return to the principle that, when an apparently positive catalyst doesn‚Äôt help a stock, that‚Äôs a sign of trouble. We‚Äôve pointed out Intel‚Äôs red flags, but now it‚Äôs up to you to decide what to do with Intel stock. At least, we can say that you‚Äôve been warned as we‚Äôre giving the stock a ‚ÄúD‚Äù grade and currently aren‚Äôt recommending an investment in Intel.On the date of publication, neither Louis¬†Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Semiconductor",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Planning to have a barbecue on the Fourth of July this year? Prepare to shell out more money than in years past.¬† A new analysis published by the American Farm Bureau (AFB) found that a typical Independence Day cookout with all the fixings this year will cost about $71.22 for a group of 10 people, up 5% from last year and a 30% spike when compared to 2019. It marks the most expensive level on record, and is the first time ever that prices have topped more than $7 per person.Driving the increase are a number of barbecue staples, including ground beef, pork chops, hamburger buns, cheese slices, strawberries, potato chips, ice cream and lemonade. HIGH INFLATION IS CHANGING THE WAY AMERICANS RETIRE ""Your grocery bill may be a shock, but it is in line with the inflation that has roiled the economy ‚Äì including the farm economy ‚Äì over the last several years,"" the report said.     A family hosts a barbecue in the backyard of their home. (iStock / iStock)Meat is the most expensive line item for a barbecue. This year, 2 pounds of ground beef will cost an average of $12.77, up more than $1, or 11%, from one year ago. The increase in beef prices is likely because cattle inventory in the U.S. is the smallest that it has been in 73 years, and beef in cold storage is setting record lows for recent years.¬†Pork chop prices have also ticked higher, climbing about 8% nationally to an average of $15.49.¬†However, Americans can expect to pay less for chicken than they did one year ago. The average cost of 2 pounds of chicken breast is about $7.83, a 4% drop from 2023 and down more than 13% from the record-high in 2022. More poultry farmers implemented biosecurity measures to stop the spread of the avian flu and to help their flocks recover. Farmers have also increased hatching and bird weights to offset losses and ""keep prices affordable,"" the AFB said.¬†RAISING A CHILD IN THE US IS GETTING EVEN MORE EXPENSIVEHowever, inflation has hit many other items that you can expect to find at a cookout.¬†The cost of homemade lemonade ‚Äì made using 1 pound of sugar and 1.5 pounds of lemons ‚Äì is about $4.19 total, a 12% jump from last year.¬†Pork and beans, potato chips, chocolate chip cookies and strawberries are also more expensive than they were last year, although they are not at record highs.

""General inflation has been highly disruptive to the whole economy, leaving behind many whose incomes haven‚Äôt kept pace.""While inflation has fallen considerably from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, it remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% goal. On top of that, inflation is up a stunning 19.4% when compared to January 2021, shortly before the inflation crisis began.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREHigh inflation has created severe financial pressures for most U.S. households, which are forced to pay more for everyday necessities like food and rent. Grocery prices are up more than 21% from the start of 2021, while shelter costs are up 18.37%, according to FOX Business calculations. Energy prices, meanwhile, are up 38.4.%.Price hikes are particularly devastating for lower-income Americans because they tend to spend more of their already-stretched paycheck on necessities and have less flexibility to save money.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, MicroStrategy chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor holds a highly skeptical view of the greenback.During an episode of the PBD Podcast hosted by Patrick Bet-David, Saylor compared the U.S. dollar to the Argentine peso.Don't missCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years ‚Äî but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or KrogerCost-of-living in America is still out of control ‚Äî use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or saysThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 ‚Äî and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how‚ÄúThe only difference [between] the U.S. dollar and the [Argentine] peso is, whereas it takes 20 years to lose your family's fortune in the peso, it takes about 90 years to lose your family's fortune in the dollar,‚Äù Saylor stated.He underscored this point with an example involving his own home.‚ÄúMy house in Miami Beach was $100,000 in 1930. It was appraised at $46 million a few years ago,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDo the calculation. It's on a path to be worth $100 million, which means that the U.S. dollar will have lost 99.9% of its value over 100 years. Warren Buffett knows this. Charlie Munger knows this.‚ÄùMicroStrategy (MSTR), a publicly-traded analytics and business intelligence company, began hoarding bitcoin in 2020 and owns 226,331 bitcoins as of June 20. This is slightly more than 1% of all bitcoin that will ever exist.Money in the bankInflation can lead to a decline in a currency's value. However, it's worth noting that the U.S. is in a far better position than Argentina in this regard.In May 2024, Argentina‚Äôs yearly inflation was a whopping 276.4%. In the U.S., the consumer price index recorded an annual increase of 3.3%.Due to the erosive effects of inflation on purchasing power, Saylor questions the wisdom of keeping dollars in the bank.‚ÄúBasically, the bottom line there is, your money in the bank isn't money. Okay, so the answer is, you shouldn't have any money in a bank,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou're basically losing 7% of all your wealth every year in a good year, if it's the dollar; you're losing 15% of your wealth in a not good year, if it's the dollar.‚ÄùOver extended periods, inflation can significantly diminish Americans' purchasing power.Story continuesFor perspective, according to the inflation calculator from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, $1 in 2023 has the same buying power as about $0.05 in 1930, indicating that the dollar has depreciated by 95% since then.Read more: Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year ‚Äî but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free)‚ÄòStrongest money‚ÄôWhile the U.S. dollar is recognized globally for its strength, Saylor believes there‚Äôs a superior alternative.‚ÄúThe strongest money in the world is bitcoin, because bitcoin is absolutely capped at 21 million,‚Äù he said.Saylor was referring to bitcoin‚Äôs supply limit, which is set at 21 million coins. This contrasts with fiat currencies, which central banks can issue in unlimited quantities. Bitcoin's fixed supply limits its vulnerability to inflation.‚ÄúIt is global money. You could take a billion dollars of bitcoin across the border, you can transfer it to a counterparty, and no government can interdict that, and nobody can inflate that,‚Äù Saylor added.As the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been volatile as of late ‚Äî yet its growth remains remarkable. Its price has surged 37% in 2024 and 94% over the last 12 months when measured in U.S. dollars.It‚Äôs important to note that while Saylor mentioned Buffett during the conversation, the Oracle of Omaha does not share his enthusiasm for bitcoin. Buffett famously stated at the 2022 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting, ‚ÄúIf you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn‚Äôt take it because what would I do with it? I‚Äôd have to sell it back to you one way or another.‚ÄùBuffett has also expressed strong confidence in the dollar‚Äôs global status. In 2015, he remarked, ‚ÄúI think the dollar will be the world's reserve currency 50 years from now, and I think the probabilities of that are very high.‚ÄùFinally, Saylor‚Äôs experience with his house on Miami beach underscores another investment insight: real estate can serve as an effective hedge against inflation. While a multi-million dollar mansion like Saylor's may be out of reach for many, real estate investment has become more accessible through real estate investment trusts (REITs) and crowdfunding platforms.What to read nextRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market ‚Äî and are betting on these assets instead.

(SOPA Images via Getty Images)Bitcoin's value fell below $59,000 (¬£46,286) on Thursday as multiple factors exacerbated selling pressure on the digital asset. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) traded down 3.9% over the 24 hours, changing hands for $58,770, as of the time of writing.Other cryptocurrencies, ether (ETH-USD) and solana (SOL-USD) have fallen further, decreasing by 4.6% and 7.3% respectively. The global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.28tn, a decrease of 4.1% over the past day, according to Coingecko data.Bitcoin liquidations spikeThe recent bitcoin price drop has been exacerbated by a spike in long liquidations. Futures traders betting that the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will increase in value have lost over $240m in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.ADVERTISEMENTBitcoin futures saw more than $61m in long liquidations, while the cryptocurrency market as a whole recorded over $247m (¬£193.66m) in long liquidations. A long liquidation occurs when an investor who holds a long position in a financial instrument, such as bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, is forced to sell that position. This typically happens in leveraged trading, where the investor has borrowed funds to increase their position size and they can't meet margin requirements, resulting in the closure of the position to prevent further losses.Read more: What are bitcoin rune etchings?Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader‚Äôs leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader‚Äôs initial margin. This happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, lacking sufficient funds to keep the trade open.Bitcoin is beset by multiple sell-pressure factorsSeveral factors have emerged over the past week to increase selling pressure on bitcoin. Notably, the Mt. Gox trustee's announcement that creditors of the defunct exchange will begin receiving repayments totalling approximately 142,000 bitcoin, starting this month.Story continuesRead more: What are bitcoin ETNs?Investors remain cautious about the possibility that Mt. Gox creditors could start dumping their redistributed bitcoin onto exchanges after waiting over a decade to receive them. Over $9.4bn in bitcoin is owed to roughly 127,000 Mt. Gox creditors. Many investors fear this could lead to many creditors cashing out after a decade of untouched profits.According to data from Lookonchain, an unidentified whale transferred 1,723 bitcoin, worth over $168m, to Binance in the past 24 hours. This transfer to the largest crypto exchange could suggest that this entity is looking to sell and secure profits.Read more: Bitcoin price dips ahead of FTX and Mt Gox bankruptcy payoutsNevertheless, the $9bn from Mt. Gox could be offset by institutional inflows to US-based spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to Dune analytics, these ETFs have accumulated over $52.5bn in bitcoin since their launch in January of this year.Spot bitcoin ETFs see net outflowsHowever, the eleven spot bitcoin ETFs in the US experienced a total daily net outflow of $20.45m on Wednesday. Only two funds recorded net inflows, while the remaining nine showed zero flows.Read more: What are bitcoin rune etchings?Grayscale's GBTC reported daily net outflows of $26.99m, partially offset by $6.55m in net inflows to Fidelity's FBTC, according to SoSoValue data. The other nine ETFs, including BlackRock's IBIT, had zero net flows.On Wednesday, the eleven Bitcoin funds had a trading volume of approximately $800m, down from $995m on Tuesday. This recent trading volume is significantly lower compared to March, when daily volumes ranged between $8bn and $10bn. Since their inception in January, these ETFs have accumulated a total net inflow of $14.62bn.German government transferring seized bitcoin to crypto exchangesMeanwhile, an analysis by Arkham Intelligence showed that the German government recently transferred $24m in seized bitcoin to the Kraken and Coinbase cryptocurrency exchanges.These bitcoin transfers originated from a wallet connected to the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and could be linked to the BKA's 2013 seizure of nearly 50,000 bitcoin from a film piracy website.Read more: What are bitcoin ETNs?Arkham Intelligence data indicates that these transfers follow previous movements of $195m in bitcoin to exchanges last week.

Their consistently rising prices have led industry leaders like Nvidia to enact stock splits, looking to make their shares more liquid and available to regular investors. But Nvidia isn't the only way to bet on this exciting new opportunity. Let's explore why Broadcom (AVGO 4.33%) is another soaring AI stock split that belongs on your investment radar.Is Broadcom the next Nvidia?Formed by the 2015 merger between Broadcom Corporation and Avago Technologies, Broadcom is a diversified semiconductor company that designs and manufactures an array of information technology hardware. Unlike Nvidia, Broadcom isn't a big player in the market for high-end, general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) used to train and run generative AI algorithms. Instead, it gains exposure to the industry through custom chips tailored to each client's specific use case.For data centers, opting for a Broadcom-designed custom chip probably has more up-front costs and commitments than buying off-the-shelf solutions like Nvidia's H100. But the trade-off comes with cost and power advantages, which can pay off over the long term. Broadcom boasts big-name clients like Alphabet (which contracts with Broadcom to design its Google TPU chips) and Chinese social media giant Bytedance, which reportedly aims to use Broadcom services to help ensure a supply of powerful processors amid rising tensions with the U.S. government. Opting for Broadcom's custom chips can help the Chinese company fit within tightening export controls that effectively block many of Nvidia's most advanced GPUs.Non-AI-related growth driversIt's never a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket -- especially if that basket is a hyped-up tech megatrend. While AI technology might transform the global economy, we don't know when that will happen, or if the current demand for AI chips is sustainable. Previous hype cycles like the internet ended badly for companies that overexposed themselves too early.¬†Image source: Getty Images.The good news is that Broadcom's business is diversified. The company provides semiconductor services for industries ranging from smartphones to enterprise networking. And while these are mainly mature businesses, they help stabilize Broadcom's operations. But the company also has an exciting non-AI-related growth driver, VMware. Completed in 2023, the $69 billion deal was one of the biggest in tech history. It gave Broadcom more exposure to the infrastructure software business and helped send overall company revenue up 43% year over year to $12.49 billion in the second quarter.Is Broadcom stock a buy?Despite shares jumping almost 470% over the last five years, many smaller investors are finally taking notice of Broadcom after management announced a 10-for-1 stock split that could bring its quadruple-digit stock price back down to earth when it goes live on July 15. Remember that this move doesn't change the company's market cap (the value of all shares outstanding) or its valuation relative to earnings. The good news is that with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of just 28, Broadcom's valuation is in line with the Nasdaq average of 31 and cheap compared to AI-related alternatives like Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices, which boast forward P/Es of 36 and 54, respectively.

We are trying to improve efficiency to mitigate that, but it will have an impact on demand.‚ÄùTargets set by Brussels indicate that European airlines must use at least 6pc sustainable fuel by 2030, with this rising to 10pc for carriers operating in the UK.This is part of a push to achieve net zero carbon emissions across the industry by 2050.Mr Gallego‚Äôs comments come after British Airways rival Lufthansa last month announced a surcharge on tickets to fund decarbonisation.The German airline said the levy will add between ‚Ç¨1 and ‚Ç¨72 (85p-¬£61) per ticket from next year.Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic chief executive, says introduction of sustainable aviation fuel could increase cost of a return trip to New York by ¬£40 - Luke MacGregor/BloombergShai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic chief executive, told the Telegraph in May that the introduction of SAF will mean the cost of a return trip to New York will rise by ¬£40 based on current prices.Mr Gallego said that the mandatory targets in Europe risk putting carriers in the region at a competitive disadvantage compared with those in other parts of the world.He told the Financial Times: ‚ÄúWe need to do it in a consistent way worldwide not to jeopardise European aviation. The reality is we do not have enough SAF, and the SAF we have is very expensive.‚ÄùLess than 1pc of total aviation fuel consumption came from sustainable sources last year, prompting airlines such as British Airways to demand Government intervention to help increase the supply of SAF.The fuel, made from used cooking oil and animal fat, is viewed as the most practical route towards reducing aviation‚Äôs net CO2 emission before new technologies, such as hydrogen propulsion, become available in the future.IAG said decisions on pricing are a matter for its individual airlines, which also include Spain‚Äôs Iberia and Aer Lingus of Ireland, but that there are no immediate plans to impose decarbonisation-related surcharges.Mr Gallego said a decision by Brussels on Wednesday to clear Lufthansa‚Äôs purchase of a 41pc stake in ITA, the Italian flag carrier and successor to bankrupt Alitalia, was ‚Äúpositive news‚Äù.IAG shares rose following the announcement amid hopes Brussels will soon also clear its own bid for Spanish leisures carrier Air Europa.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

However the rally has fizzled, with bitcoin losing more than 21% since then.A politically charged backdrop, with ongoing elections in France and Britain, is resulting in some risk reduction, analysts said, alongside the changing odds in the U.S. election campaign.Analysts also pointed to reports that Mt. Gox, the world's leading exchange for cryptocurrencies before it went defunct in 2014, is repaying its creditors, which could be dragging bitcoin lower if those creditors offload their tokens.""There is an anticipation that some of those original buyers of bitcoin will start to sell on the market, which is a fairly big chunk,"" Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG, said.Sycamore added however that while this was a period of consolidation for the cryptocurrency after strong gains earlier this year, it could retest the March highs and probably push up towards $80,000.Ether, another major cryptocurrency, was trading more than 1% lower at $3,213.0, and is down more than 22% from its mid-March highs.(Reporting by Sameer Manekar in Singapore; Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore; Editing by Vidya Ranganathan and Jan Harvey)View comments",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most top-tier blue-chip and long-term investment opportunities, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), are already well-known and heavily purchased.However, as concerns grow about the concentration of investments in a few mega-cap stocks, demand for breakout stocks is increasing. These breakout stocks may not remain so for long and will instead likely turn into the next big media story of runaway growth and strong upward momentum.Despite the current economic uncertainty, some promising breakout stocks offer a blend of growth, stability, and income. These stocks span various market caps and sectors and could provide significant returns and diversify your portfolio. While no investment comes without risk, these under-the-radar breakout stocks have strong potential to become standout performers in the years ahead.Atlanta Braves Holdings¬†(BATRA)Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comYou don‚Äôt need to be a billionaire to own a stake in a sports team. By investing in breakout stock Atlanta Braves Holdings (NASDAQ:BATRA), you can claim a slice of this iconic Georgian sports franchise. Listed in July 2023, this stock provides investors access to the Braves‚Äô sales revenue and income from the associated real estate assets within the Braves ecosystem.If you‚Äôre looking for high-profile endorsements, just look at some of the company‚Äôs major shareholders. Among the backers of Atlanta Braves Holdings is Warren Buffett, who holds a position in this firm as part of his broader investment in SiriusXM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI). The Braves‚Äô former owner, Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LSXMA), is currently in a high-profile merger with SiriusXM. Buffett‚Äôs interest in this unique investment ecosystem is a strong endorsement. Additionally, legendary value investor Mario Gabelli is a fan of the stock, predicting that shares could reach $55 in the coming years.Despite overall market challenges, Atlanta Braves Holdings stands out as a potential home run for investors seeking unique opportunities in the sports and entertainment sectors.Rocket Lab USA (RKLB)Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands out as more than just a unique breakout stock ‚Äî it represents a gateway into the burgeoning trillion-dollar space industry. Last year, Rocket Lab gained significant attention with a record-setting number of launches. This year, the company continues to impress with a substantial government contract worth over $500 million and a strong earnings report.Rocket Lab‚Äôs current launch and contract backlog exceeds $1 billion, providing a promising forecast for potential revenue, even though clients may cancel. With first-quarter revenue hitting $92.7 million, this backlog indicates considerable growth opportunities.Further cementing its position in the global space sector, Rocket Lab recently secured a deal with Japanese company Synspective for 10 Electron launches through 2027. This partnership highlights Synspective‚Äôs trust in Rocket Lab‚Äôs capabilities as a space-based operator and delivery system for its satellites. While the financial terms were not disclosed, the agreement underscores Rocket Lab‚Äôs growing role in the space industry, making it a breakout stock with substantial future potential.Getty Images¬†(GETY)Source: shutterstock.com/360bGetty Images (NYSE:GETY) is an often overlooked breakout stock with significant potential, especially given its unique position in the artificial intelligence sector. Known for its extensive library of stock photos and journalism photography, Getty serves many clients, including creatives, media companies and corporate marketing teams. However, what truly sets Getty apart is its innovative collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA),  making it an intriguing AI stock to watch.Earlier this year, Getty introduced a generative AI image creator powered by Nvidia. This tool simplifies creating customized images for professionals and amateurs, offering a more user-friendly experience than other platforms like Midjourney‚Äôs Discord-based service. More importantly to publishers, Getty‚Äôs tool also includes robust legal protections for users, addressing growing concerns about copyright issues in AI, as evidenced by ongoing legal battles involving companies like OpenAI.Despite a slight decline in sales and income in its latest earnings report, Getty saw a significant rise in subscription rates, which now make up 55.4% of its net revenue. This growing subscription base will expand further as Getty‚Äôs AI-driven services become more widely adopted. This positions Getty Images as an undervalued stock with promising AI potential, making it a strong candidate among low-priced stocks with upside.Parsons (PSN)Source: Bumble Dee / Shutterstock.comParsons (NYSE:PSN) is a defense technology company with a diverse portfolio that positions it as one of the more under-the-radar breakout AI stocks. Unlike companies focusing primarily on software, Parsons integrates AI into hardware-centric technological developments, setting it apart in the industry.Parsons has achieved notable milestones in ballistic missile site development, rocketry hardware, nuclear site management, and large-scale infrastructure projects. These operations demand sophisticated technical data management and oversight, allowing Parsons to lead with AI solutions that enhance its hardware capabilities. This makes Parsons a key player in AI-enabled defense technologies, an area likely to gain more attention as political campaigns bring defense issues to the forefront.Additionally, Parsons is expanding its use of AI with innovative drone solutions for infrastructure inspection. These AI-driven tools transform how bridges, roadways, and water treatment facilities are evaluated, making the process more efficient and thorough. As the U.S. faces growing infrastructure challenges, Parsons‚Äô ability to deploy AI to address complex and hazardous environments makes it an essential player in the field, offering significant potential for growth and innovation.Photronics (PLAB)Source: Mentor57 / ShutterstockPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) is a small but powerful player in the tech sector with significant growth potential. Unlike typical semiconductor stocks, Photronics focuses on semiconductor photomasks, an advanced technology with substantial future implications.Photronics‚Äô photomasks are vital for precision in microchip manufacturing, enabling the development of artificial intelligence and quantum computing through increasingly complex and precise circuitry. These photomasks are essential for shrinking transistors and components, driving Moore‚Äôs Law‚Äôs progress. This strategic positioning at the intersection of precision and cost-effectiveness places Photronics at the forefront of current and emerging technologies, making it a compelling pick among under-the-radar tech stocks.Valued at just 12x earnings, Photronics offers an attractive entry point for investors. Its steady income stream reflects solid financial health, and despite being relatively young in the semiconductor industry, the company is poised to benefit significantly from the expanding use of semiconductors across various sectors.PSQ Holdings (PSQH)Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comFor those interested in fairly speculative investments, PSQ Holdings (NYSE:PSQH) is a unique breakout penny stock trading around $3.50 per share with a market cap of approximately $110 million. Despite its small size, this company is positioned at the cutting edge of emerging e-commerce trends that could significantly impact the market in the coming years.PSQ Holdings‚Äô flagship platform is the digital marketplace PublicSquare, which emphasizes helping consumers ‚Äúshop their values‚Äù by aligning purchases with personal beliefs and ethics. While the company‚Äôs conservative ethos might initially stand out, the broader concept behind PublicSquare transcends political affiliations. The platform taps into a growing desire among consumers to support businesses that reflect their values and principles.In today‚Äôs fragmented social media landscape, people often find themselves within like-minded networks or echo chambers. This trend extends to shopping habits, with a rising preference for e-commerce platforms that align with personal values. PublicSquare meets this demand by offering American-made goods, starkly contrasting the declining quality of many overseas products found on giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Nintendo (NTDOY)Source: ESOlex / Shutterstock.comNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) consistently makes my list of breakout stocks, and for good reason. The Japanese company exemplifies a business model that stands apart from many American public companies. Instead of focusing on short-term gains, Nintendo takes a long-term approach, prioritizing sustainable growth over immediate profits. This strategy, perhaps, is why Nintendo has been a resilient player in the market since its founding in 1889 as a playing card company.A look at Nintendo‚Äôs balance sheet underscores its commitment to long-term stability. The company maintains a robust cash reserve and carries no debt, providing a solid financial foundation to navigate economic fluctuations and seize new opportunities. This financial strength is so compelling that Microsoft considered acquiring Nintendo in 2020, recognizing its value as a prime low-priced stock with significant potential. Although the acquisition didn‚Äôt materialize, Microsoft‚Äôs interest highlights Nintendo‚Äôs enduring appeal in the market.Recently, Nintendo has also capitalized on its extensive intellectual property, opening new revenue streams that further enhance its position as a smart investment. The company‚Äôs prudent financial management and innovative approach ensure it remains a standout in the gaming industry, making it a compelling choice for investors seeking both value and growth.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

While investors should always distinguish share price from market capitalization, there are cheap stocks that could be potential gold mines.¬†Growth stocks are typically characterized by companies that can expand their revenue and earnings per share faster than the broader market. Historically, some of the most successful companies in the world started as small enterprises with share prices under $50. For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were once considered risky bets with low share prices. Yet early investors have seen remarkable returns in the long term.While not all growth stocks have the ability to grow to trillion-dollar titans, many of them still hold the potential to outperform. Therefore, identifying and investing in these growth stocks early can lead to substantial wealth creation overtime.Now, let‚Äôs discover the top three growth stocks under $50 set to make early investors very wealthy!Palantir (PLTR)Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comPalantir (NYSE:PLTR), a data analytics software company, has been making waves in artificial intelligence in 2024. The company has made serious strides in the last 12 months, and its financial outlook for this year is extremely strong.¬†Palantir‚Äôs flagship products, Gotham and Foundry, are widely used for diverse applications ranging from counter-terrorism to financial data analysis. Its close relationship with government agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Defense and other intelligence agencies, has been a huge competitive advantage. While this seems all fine and dandy, Wall Street has heavily criticized its reliance on government contracts. However, that will be a thing of the past as the company‚Äôs growing commercial platform continues to gain traction. In Q1 FY24, Palantir achieved its sixth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. Additionally, its commercial revenue is currently outpacing its government revenue, with U.S. commercial customer count up 69% from the year prior. With another year of GAAP profitability forecasted for FY24, PLTR stock is among the top growth stocks under $50 to buy in 2024.GigaCloud Technology (GCT)Source: ShutterstockGigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) is an emerging e-commerce platform that specializes in providing large scale B2B services. The company focuses on connecting manufacturers and resellers, particularly in the furniture and large parcel industries.¬†GigaCloud‚Äôs innovative technology platform makes it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to expand their business globally. It helps streamline the cumbersome sourcing, logistics, and payment processing of international trade. Additionally, the company‚Äôs focus on large parcels is a unique competitive advantage as more businesses seek to optimize their operations and reduce costs. GigaCloud has demonstrated extremely impressive growth metrics, especially in the last 12 months. In the 2023 fiscal year, revenue increased 44% year over year to a record $704 million. Net earnings also skyrocketed 294% year over year to $94.1 million, with free cash flow more than doubling to $129.5 million. Growth also accelerated in the first quarter of 2024, driven by strong revenue, earnings and GigaCloud marketplace GMV expansion. With continued momentum across all key financial metrics, GCT stock is one of the best growth stocks under $50 to become extremely wealthy.Payoneer (PAYO)Source: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.comPayoneer (NASDAQ:PAYO) is an emerging fintech company that specializes in cross-border payment solutions. Its growing revenue and earnings provide early investors with immense potential for substantial returns.¬†Payoneer will benefit from increasing globalization of business and the rising demand for efficient cross-border payment solutions. This is especially prevalent for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who don‚Äôt have the large budgets and are more reliant on contract workers. Its platform is primarily used by a diverse range of businesses, including freelancers, online sellers, and digital marketplaces. As the gig economy and freelance work continues to grow, Payoneer is well positioned to capture market share. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue increased 19% year over year to $228.18 million. Net earnings swelled 265% year over year to $29 million, with B2B payment volume up 33% from the year prior. Payoneer‚Äôs financial performance over the last several quarters highlights its strong growth trajectory. If you‚Äôre on the lookout for growth stocks under $50, PAYO should definitely be a top contender on your list.¬†On the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

And that‚Äôs for good reason. Most major indices continue to have their performance dominated by a handful of stocks on a given day, unlike previous markets with more breadth. This can be a good and a bad thing. But for now, it‚Äôs mainly a positive given how most portfolios are currently constructed.The thing is, we may start to see some divergence build among certain mega-cap growth stocks in the market. I think some companies are starting to look overvalued, with others seeming to represent reasonable value. The three companies I‚Äôm going to discuss below each fall in the latter category.Meta Platforms (META)Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comSeeing a 6.8% of stock increase in the past month, Meta Platforms‚Äô (NASDAQ:META)  stock price has seemingly headed only higher. In recent years, Meta has continued to heavily invest in its Reality Labs division, focusing on metaverse initiatives. Alongside these investments, the company has provided more capital to its virtual reality and generative AI segments, launching Llama 3 language model and an AI image generator via WhatsApp.The company also shows an impressive ROE that surpassed the 7.4% industry average. This has supported 11% of the company‚Äôs income since 2019. Moreover, it has outperformed the 6% growth rate of the industry. Meta retains a high percentage of its profits with a low three-year median payout ratio of 2.8%, indicating a focus on reinvesting in business growth.To add, the company has over 3.2 billion in user base to support its projects, including enhancing user experience. Advertising revenues are also noteworthy, growing 27% in Q1. So long as this cash cow continues pumping out growing cash flows, its valuation looks far from inflated right now. Amazon (AMZN)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAnother mega cap stock to own is e-Commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). In Q1 2024, the company saw a 200% increase due to its strong cloud computing segment. Amazon boosted AI sales by 17% and operating income surged 84%. AWS now contributes 60% of Amazon‚Äôs operating income, with potential to unlock $600 billion in software revenue by 2028, suggesting a 17% upside in stock value.Amazon is reportedly developing a new chatbot called ‚ÄúMetis,‚Äù utilizing an advanced AI model named Olympus instead of its older Titan model. The approach, known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), allows the chatbot to retrieve information from trusted sources, enhancing control over text output.RAG enables systems to access up-to-date data from sources like APIs and documents without retraining models, enhancing accuracy. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and AGI team‚Äôs head scientist Rohit Prasad are leading Metis‚Äôs development, with a team including veteran Alexa AI workers. Metis, potentially launching in September, might face stiff competition from established players like ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Bard.In other AMZN news, Amazon‚Äôs Prime Day 2024 will be held on July 16 and 17 in various countries including the U.S., UK, and Germany. Despite spanning two days, it‚Äôs still called ‚ÄúPrime Day.‚Äù India will have a separate Prime Day later in the summer. The event will feature hundreds of deals in millions of products, accessible for Amazon Prime subscribers on July 16.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comNothing beats the Oracle of Ohama when it comes to investment schemes, and his very own Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) remains a solid investment choice for investors seeking stability. Recently, the company sold shares in BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), according to its HK stock exchange filing.¬† Disclosures are required in Hong Kong when stakes fall below whole percentages.¬†There‚Äôs a reason why Berkshire is rated a strong buy by most market analysts. The consensus is that this stock continues to have 15% upside from here, even after its incredible run. Over the past five years, Berkshire shareholders have doubled their money in this name. That‚Äôs reflective of the sort of slow-and-steady approach most of the company‚Äôs holdings provide investors. In a market of potential uncertainty, this company‚Äôs diversified holdings and substantial cash reserves are likely to be valued much more dearly by the market.Given its size, there are doubts about its continued success. However, its strategy of acquiring excellent businesses at fair prices distinguishes it. The company‚Äôs portfolio is resilient to economic downturns, combining stable businesses with high-growth tech stocks, ideal for long-term investment.

It‚Äôs always difficult to identify the IPOs with solid fundamentals that will continue to grow year-on-year. Especially with how stocks are susceptible to increased volatility at IPO, this can be nearly impossible.¬†At IPO, more often than not, these companies don‚Äôt have solid financials. Analyst estimates can widely vary, resulting in massive misses on earnings. While a company‚Äôs financial metrics can¬†be used¬†as a relative gauge of¬†financial¬†health, they aren‚Äôt an¬†end-all be-all¬†for investors. The advent of AI can be seen in the market, poising many up-and-coming¬†technology stocks¬†to be the¬†NVIDIAs¬†(NASDAQ:NVDA) or¬†Googles¬†(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) of the future.Keeping this in mind, here are three early-stage tech stocks with high growth potential.Astera Labs (ALAB)Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAstera Labs (NASDAQ:ALAB) is a semiconductor company offering connectivity solutions¬†to aid¬†hyperscalers and data centers.¬†ALAB remains a promising investment during the age of AI as¬†one of the new early-stage tech stocks.¬†Despite a shaky stock price following their IPO in March 2024, ALAB is¬†up 12.9% YTD. In addition,¬†revenue growth (YoY) is up 44.97%, with analysts predicting continuous growth for 2024 Q3 and Q4 reports. ALAB also demonstrates impressive profitability,¬†with a 77.17% growth profit margin, 56.52% higher than the sector median. Although 2024 Q1 earnings¬†reported a $93 million net loss, this can primarily¬†be attributed¬†to underwriting expenses following their successful IPO.¬†ALAB continues to position itself at the forefront of the semiconductor connectivity solutions industry. This is exemplified by through its retimer release: the¬†Aries 6 Retimer. This new product allows AI platform developers to design high bandwidth, low latency¬†PCIe¬†connectivity. The capabilities on the Aries 6 establish ALAB as a retimer industry market leader. Expanding their operations, ALAB recently¬†announced a new campus in India, enabling the company to tap into the rich engineering talent and interconnecting technologies in the region.ALAB stands out as a leading innovator in the semiconductor connectivity solutions industry. Its impressive financial performance and large potential for growth make it a compelling choice in the AI era.Rubrik (RBRK)Source: vs148 / ShutterstockRubrik¬†(NYSE:RBRK) is a cloud data management and data security that IPO‚Äôd in April 2024.¬†Yahoo! Finance¬†reports 12 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on RBRK between $40.00 and $50.00, with a mean of $45.86.RBRK showed signs of seemingly having difficulty in handling operational expenditures with a net income of¬†-$732.09 million. Conversely, the company reports a positive free cash flow of $297.12 million, conveying strong profitability. However these metrics make sense in context. The large negative net income stems from¬†switching business models¬†from selling licenses of products to a subscription service, which isn‚Äôt counted in FCF.RBRK has positioned itself for future growth through a¬†strategic partnership¬†with fellow industry leader¬†Crowdstrike(NASDAQ:CRWD). This partnership merges Rubrik Security Cloud‚Äôs data-centric security attack analysis with Crowdstrike‚Äôs AI-powered mobile device cybersecurity defense platform. The result is a platform that can detect, investigate¬†and¬†respond to cybersecurity threats. In addition to creating a comprehensive cybersecurity platform, the partnership aids Rubrik‚Äôs business model overhaul with the potential to grow the new subscription service business model. With its strategic partnership and new business model, Rubrik is one of the early-stage tech stocks I highly recommend.Arm Holdings (ARM)Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.comArm Holdings¬†(NASDAQ:ARM)¬†is a British microprocessor manufacturer and software developing company joining¬†the charge in¬†the recent artificial intelligence boom. As one of the early-stage tech stocks IPO‚Äôing back in September 2023, its share value¬†has over¬†doubled YTD.Despite concerns¬†of¬†overvalued shares, financials for ARM back up the lofty projections.¬†In its most recent March 2024 earnings report, the firm boasted a¬†46.6%¬†increase in total revenue YOY. Furthermore, this¬†was accompanied¬†by 224.00 million in net income, an astounding 7366.67% YOY increase in the metric.¬†Coupled with¬†a 6.5% decrease in total liabilities, ARM‚Äôs remarkable growth is more than justified.The current AI Boom only strengthens ARM‚Äôs position in the market. With other chip makers such as Nvidia soaring to record highs, ARM benefits through their¬†collection of royalties and commissions from other tech giants¬†from licensing agreements. In addition,¬† bullish sentiment goes beyond the retail market, with institutional investors also catching on. At the end of Q1 2024,¬†29 hedge funds had large positions on ARM.

This time, @evleaks on X released copies of product pages (and images) for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6.The main spec changes are for the flip. Previous Galaxy Z Flip models only had 12-megapixel rear cameras, so the Flip 6's purported 50-megapixel wide camera (paired with a 12-megapixel ultrawide) is a huge upgrade. If the leak is accurate, it'll also have a bigger battery.According to the product pages, Samsung didn't give the Galaxy Z Fold 6 many substantial upgrades, but the new model will have a slightly larger front display. Conversely, the folding main display is slightly smaller and the phone is a bit thinner.The leak spoils Samsung‚Äôs July 10 party a little, but we reckon the company has plenty more to show off, including the official debut of its Galaxy Ring, Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch Ultra, Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.

It has a couple of fantastic products in Zepbound, which is approved for weight loss, and Mounjaro, which is essentially the same thing but is approved to treat diabetes. Between the two of them, the company is sitting on a gold mine, with their combined peak annual revenue potentially topping more than $50 billion. That's not too bad for a company that generated less than $35 billion in all of last year.But as promising as those products may be, they aren't why I think Eli Lilly can hit a $1 trillion market capitalization and keep going higher. Instead, it's management's outlook for the future and its long-term strategy that should have investors bullish on the road ahead. This can still be an excellent stock to buy, even at what may seem like a hugely inflated valuation.Eli Lilly looks to ""exploit"" its leadBeing the top company in the anti-obesity market and the most valuable healthcare company in the world is impressive, but staying in those positions is going to be difficult, and Eli Lilly knows that. This is why management isn't content with sitting back and watching revenue for Zepbound and Mounjaro roll in. Instead, the company remains focused on building out its business so that it's even more robust, and so that it develops further products to fuel its long-term growth.Management is investing billions into growing its business and developing more products. Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks knows the company has a lead in the anti-obesity market but he says it plans to ""exploit that lead"" by working on bringing more products to market. It won't be easy but management's plan to add capacity and develop further weight-loss products is why Eli Lilly can be a growth machine for years to come. Promising products in its pipeline could be near the finish lineThe company has many other weight-loss products in development that can become future growth catalysts for the business. Orforglipron is an oral weight loss product that is currently in phase 3 trials and could come to market soon. In clinical trials, after 36 weeks of use, participants on the once-daily pill lost an average of 14.7% of their body weight. Retatrutide is another promising drug. Patients take it as a weekly injection, and in clinical trials it has helped them lose 17.5% of their body weight after 24 weeks. It will be exciting to see what the drug could achieve over a longer time frame as that weight loss is already comparable to what patients might achieve with Zepbound or Mounjaro. What may be most important for patients in the end are the side effects and overall tolerability of these drugs, given that they may need to stay on them indefinitely -- one of the risks is that once patients stop taking the treatments, they may regain some or all of the lost weight. And this is why developing further weight-loss treatments can still be a good move for Eli Lilly even if the weight loss achieved is similar to other drugs.Is Eli Lilly a no-brainer buy?Eli Lilly isn't cheap to own. With the stock trading at more than 130 times earnings, many investors are likely spooked by its valuation. But as the business grows, its earnings will rise and that multiple will come down. Cautious growth investors may point out that with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 66, its near-term growth is already priced in to the stock, and it's still at a high valuation.But as Eli Lilly obtains approval for more drugs, price targets, estimates, and the overall outlook for the business will get a boost. If you invest in the stock before all of that happens, you could stand to earn a much better return than if you wait. While there are no guarantees as to which products may obtain approval, for such an innovative company with a solid track record, Eli Lilly is arguably worth taking the risk. With management zeroed in on growing its operations, this can be a terrific stock to put in your portfolio for the long haul.In the near term, Eli Lilly may look like it's an expensive stock but if you're hanging on for five years or more, you can still be in a position to generate even more fantastic returns.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

But we cannot rely solely on having the AI chips with the advanced manufacturing process nodes as the ultimate foundation for AI infrastructure,‚Äù Zhang told a forum at the World AI Conference in Shanghai, a three-day event that kicked off on Thursday.""If we believe that not having the most advanced AI chips means we will be unable to lead in AI, then we need to abandon this viewpoint,"" Zhang said.Huawei, which has been placed on the U.S. Entity List barring it from purchasing advanced chips from U.S. companies, has developed its own AI chip product called Ascend, which is now used by many companies in China to train AI models.However, the Ascend AI chip, along with many others from Chinese companies, is considered to be significantly inferior in terms of computing power compared to the offerings from Nvidia.Zhang called for innovative approaches that place more focus on the cloud, which he said can help to compensate for the lack of advanced AI chips through innovation in computing architecture.He also said that a converged approach is needed to combine cloud, edge, and networks in ways that can be used to reduce energy consumption and improve overall efficiency.

(ZUMA Press, ZUMA Press, Inc.)Samsung (005930.KS)Samsung Electronics rose more than 3% overnight, as it is set to post a 13-fold increase in second-quarter profit from a year earlier. This comes as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology boosts a rebound in memory chip prices.Operating profit for the world's biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and TVs likely rose to 8.8tn won ($6.34bn) in the quarter ended 30 June. This is according to the average of an LSEG SmartEstimate from 27 analysts, weighted toward those who are more consistently accurate.That amount would be Samsung's highest profit since the third quarter of 2022, compared with an operating profit of 670 billion won in the second quarter of last year.ADVERTISEMENTPerformance at the tech giant's key semiconductor division likely continued to improve its second consecutive quarterly profit, as memory chip prices keep rising from mid-2022 to end-2023, a trough that was caused by a weak post-pandemic demand for gadgets that use the chips.Samsung is expected to compete with rival Apple (APPL) at the top end of the market when it launches its latest flagship foldable phones and mobile accessories, including a new ring for health monitoring, on 10 July in Paris.Boeing (BA)Boeing faces new perils if federal prosecutors revive a criminal charge against the aviation giant by the end of this week and the company decides to plead guilty.A plea deal could get rejected by a judge. Big fines will have to be paid and, perhaps the biggest danger, is the effect that a conviction may have on Boeing‚Äôs already-battered bottom line.Criminal convictions can foreclose or suspend a company‚Äôs right to contract with the federal government and frustrate its ability to secure loans, according to Eddie Jauregui, a white-collar defence attorney with Holland & Knight and former federal prosecutor.Read more: Global Oil Outlook Faces Test as Softness in China SurfacesThose consequences have particular meaning for Boeing, which counts the federal government as its largest customer.

Under the leadership of CEO William Miller, OkayCoin is setting new standards for high-yield staking opportunities, positioning its users to maximize returns as market dynamics evolve. ""Anticipating a significant uptick in the altcoin sector, we have proactively optimized our Ethereum staking services to offer some of the highest yields available in the market today,"" said William Miller, CEO of OkayCoin. ""This initiative is designed to equip our users with robust tools to increase their earnings potential ahead of expected market movements."" Strategically Increasing Staking YieldsThe enhancements to OkayCoin‚Äôs¬†Ethereum staking program¬†include increased interest rates and improved reward structures that are designed to attract both new and seasoned investors. These changes come at a crucial time when the cryptocurrency community is buzzing with predictions of a strong altcoin season, which typically sees increased activity and price spikes across alternative cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin. Empowering Users with Competitive Staking OptionsOkayCoin's revamped Ethereum staking strategy includes several key features:  Enhanced Yields: Substantially higher interest rates on Ethereum staked through OkayCoin‚Äôs platform.  Flexible Staking Terms: Options that cater to different investment horizons and risk preferences, accommodating both short-term and long-term investors.  Real-Time Performance Tracking: Enhanced dashboard features that allow users to monitor their staking performance and make informed decisions quickly.  Education and Support to Navigate Market ChangesUnderstanding the complexities of crypto market trends and their implications for staking can be daunting for many investors. To address this, OkayCoin has ramped up its educational initiatives, offering comprehensive resources and expert support to help users understand market trends and optimize their staking strategies. ""We are committed to providing our users with not only the tools but also the knowledge they need to succeed in the evolving crypto landscape,"" added Miller. ""Our educational programs are designed to demystify market trends and empower investors to take strategic actions based on informed insights."" Enhancing Security in Volatile MarketsWith increased yields and market activity comes the need for heightened security measures. OkayCoin has implemented advanced security protocols to ensure that all staking operations are protected against potential cyber threats and market volatilities. Future Outlook and Expansion PlansAs OkayCoin continues to anticipate and react to market trends, it is also expanding its service offerings beyond Ethereum to include a variety of other promising altcoins. This expansion is part of the company's broader strategy to offer diverse staking opportunities across a range of cryptocurrencies, thereby catering to a wider audience and fostering a more inclusive cryptocurrency ecosystem. ""We see this enhancement of our¬†Ethereum staking¬†yields as just the beginning,"" Miller concluded.

aH59J4KpGDJWaDk,Yahoo Finance,google,Alphabet Stock Soars to New Peak. Here's Why I'm Doubling Down.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-stock-soars-peak-heres-120000494.html,2024-07-04 08:00,2024-07-04 08:07,GOOGL,,"After a rebound year in 2023, the tech sector continued its momentum through the first half of this year. Notable tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq-100 are up around 20% and 19%, respectively, largely due to the growth of big tech stocks.Like most stocks associated with artificial intelligence (AI), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has benefited from the technology's ushering into the mainstream. Alphabet's stock is up close to 32% this year and reached a new all-time high in late June.When stocks are flirting with peaks, many investors become hesitant, fearing a correction could be in the works. Whether that happens remains to be seen, but as a long-term investor, I'm doubling down on Alphabet, and here's why.Google will remain the king of search advertisingAlphabet's bread and butter has been and will continue to be money earned from Google advertising. In the first quarter, Alphabet made $80.5 billion, and Google advertising accounted for over 76% of it. The good news, though, is that it's less than in previous quarters, a signal that it's becoming less reliant on it.Concerns about how new AI implementation may affect Alphabet's advertising revenue are valid but overblown. On one end, Google makes money when users click links on their search ads, so if users get their questions answered by Google's AI Overview answers, then a slowdown is possible.On the other hand, AI inclusion also opens up new advertising opportunities with new ad formats. Google advertising is so important to Alphabet's business that you have to assume the company wouldn't overlook the effect of its AI Overview implementation.When you routinely have around a 90% market share in online search, you have more room to experiment and discover ways to enhance user engagement and create more targeted advertising opportunities.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) ChartGoogle Cloud could be a huge growth areaThe cloud computing industry is rapidly growing, and many assume AI advancements will add to the momentum. Google Cloud is still a ways behind leaders Amazon Web Services (31% market share) and Microsoft Azure (25% market share) in terms of adaptability,¬†but the platform has turned the corner on profitability and should contribute to growing margins.Cloud platforms have a lot of fixed costs, such as data center operations and other infrastructure-related expenses. This means it takes a certain scale before the platforms achieve sustainable profitability. Now that Google Cloud has seemingly crossed that threshold, it should see a financial boost from a segment that was once weighing down its margins.Story continuesGoogle Cloud revenue in the first quarter was $9.6 billion, up $2.1 billion from last year. Its operating income (profit from its core operations) had a more dramatic jump, increasing over 370% year over year. This increased efficiency helped increase Alphabet's operating margin to 32% from 25% last year.Alphabet seems to be the best value in big techThe ""Magnificent Seven"" is a phrase coined to describe seven of the world's most influential tech companies. They include Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Alphabet. As they go, so does the tech sector, for the most part.Alphabet seems to be the ""cheapest"" of the bunch, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just under 28. Being the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven doesn't automatically make Alphabet cheap because those stocks are routinely priced at a premium, but Alphabet is cheaper than its average for the past decade.GOOGL PE Ratio ChartThis could be a great chance for investors to grab a piece of a world-class company at a fair valuation.¬†Alphabet has strong growth prospects, so it's easy to justify its valuation for long-term investors. This growth won't happen overnight, but Alphabet's newly announced dividend should buy some patience from investors.The quarterly dividend is $0.20, with a yield below 0.5%, so it's not necessarily a must-have for income-seeking investors. Still, initiating a dividend program at all should signal Alphabet's confidence in its financial health and ability to sustain long-term profitability.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Alphabet wasn‚Äôt one of them.

dViaIWgPIFHrxsr,CNBC,yahoo,Tesla short sellers lost $3.5 billion in two days of trading after deliveries report,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/tesla-short-sellers-lost-3point5-billion-in-two-days-after-q2-deliveries.html,2024-07-04 08:00,2024-07-04 08:11,TSLA,,"Tesla shares have jumped this week, sparked by a better-than-expected deliveries report for the second quarter.The rally has hurt short sellers, who are betting on a drop in the stock.Investors will get a clearer picture of Tesla's finances later this month, when the company reports quarterly earnings. Tesla's better-than-expected deliveries report this week has been bad news for traders betting on a drop in the electric vehicle maker's stock.With the shares rallying 17% in the two trading days since the second-quarter report, short sellers have lost an estimated $3.5 billion on a mark-to-market basis, according to data from S3 Partners.It's been a painful few months for short sellers, as Tesla shares have soared 73% since bottoming for the year in April. After closing at $246.39 in shortened trading on Wednesday, the stock is a little more than $2 shy of wiping out its loss for the year.Short interest in¬†Tesla¬†currently stands at 3.5% of float, or 97 million shares shorted, with a $22.4 billion notional value.Tesla reported second-quarter deliveries on Tuesday of 443,956, topping Wall Street estimates of 439,000. Deliveries fell 4.8% from a year earlier, but the decline wasn't as steep as the 8.5% year-over-year drop in the first quarter.While the deliveries report suggested demand for Tesla vehicles remains stronger than feared, it offered a limited view into company performance.With its autos business mired in a sales decline due to an aging lineup, and stronger competition than ever, Tesla has for months been incentivizing EV purchases with discounts, low- or no-interest financing options and other perks.In the second quarter, for example, Tesla slashed prices in Germany and Norway and offered zero-interest loan promos in China, even for its entry-level Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUVs. In the U.S., Tesla offered a three-year, 2% APR financing deal for buyers of its rear-wheel drive Model 3.Meanwhile, Tesla's newest model, the angular steel Cybertruck, has gotten off to a slow start, with quality problems necessitating four voluntary recalls in the U.S. in less than a year. Tesla's earnings report later this month will provide a clearer picture of the company's financial health. Analysts are expecting to see a revenue decline of 2.9% to $24.2 billion, according to LSEG, following a decline of 9% in the first quarter.""Clearly the financing promos on both the Model Y and Model 3 drove considerable volume growth, but as we have seen with other sizable price cuts and discounts, demand is pulled forward and new demand must be created in 3Q and beyond, which has proven challenging over the last 18 months,"" Ronald Jewsikow, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. He has a sell rating on the stock.Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose net worth has increased by about $15 billion in the past two days, celebrated the hit that short sellers are taking. That included a personal attack on Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who has a history of shorting the stock and beefing with Musk.""Once Tesla fully solves autonomy and has Optimus in volume production, anyone still holding a short position will be obliterated,"" Musk wrote in a post on X. ""Even Gates.""Optimus is Tesla's humanoid robot now being developed. Musk has claimed these robots will one day turn Tesla into a company worth tens of trillions of dollars. Tesla's market cap is currently below $800 billion.Meanwhile, Tesla's challenges in its core, automotive business remain.The company regularly rolls out improvements to its in-vehicle software, and a new update promises to bring YouTube, Amazon Music, and weather and air quality apps to drivers' infotainment systems. But Tesla still hasn't delivered software that can turn its existing cars into self-driving vehicles.Further, a recent Axios-Harris poll found, the company is experiencing brand deterioration that's at least partly due to Musk's ""antics"" and ""political rants."" A New York Times survey out this week also said Musk's ""polarizing statements,"" and ""political activity"" are driving away some ""left-leaning consumers.""Musk has called for a ""red wave"" in upcoming U.S. elections and has said that he and former President Donald Trump speak frequently. He's also shared, liked and promoted far-right accounts and content on X. Proponents of electric vehicles, by contrast, tend to be lean left politically, according to research from¬†Pew Research¬†and¬†Gallup¬†last year.WATCH: Tesla deliveries are being 'overanalyzed' by investors",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

When he was in the market for a new car, he knew he wanted a Tesla, but also knew he didn‚Äôt want to spend a mint on it.Instead, he chose the least expensive Tesla he could find ‚Äî the Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus. Here‚Äôs why.Wealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.Why He Wanted a TeslaBrian really likes new gadgets and cars.‚ÄúI‚Äôve been fascinated by electric cars for years,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTesla, in particular, caught my eye because, and I know this sounds cheesy, but they‚Äôre not just making electric cars ‚Äî they‚Äôre changing how we think about driving.‚ÄùEven though Brian could buy any car he wants thanks to his high net worth, he still thinks about saving money. He even wondered if an electric car could help him spend less money over time.Picking the Cheapest OneWhen Brian went to buy his Tesla, he didn‚Äôt choose the most expensive one. Instead, he chose the Model 3, Tesla‚Äôs cheapest car.‚ÄúIt still has all the important features, but without the extra fancy stuff that I don‚Äôt really need,‚Äù noted Brian.According to him, sometimes having less can be better. He didn‚Äôt need a super-fast car or anything lavish or luxurious. He just wanted a good, efficient car for everyday driving.Find Out: I‚Äôm a Frugal Self-Made Millionaire: 6 Things I Never Waste Money OnSaving MoneyYou might assume that people with a lot of money always choose whatever is the most expensive. On the contrary, Brian said that isn‚Äôt true, especially not for him.He continued, ‚ÄúPeople often think millionaires always buy the most expensive things. But, hello, many of us got rich by being smart with our money.‚ÄùBefore buying the car, Brian did some math. He found out that over five years, he would save about $5,000 on gas compared to his old car. Plus, electric cars don‚Äôt need as many repairs, saving even more.What It‚Äôs Like To DriveBrian was curious about how the cheapest Tesla would feel to drive. Luckily, he loved it and thought the ride was just as great as the pricier versions.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs smooth, quiet and feels very high-tech,‚Äù said Brian. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs honestly a joy to drive.‚ÄùStory continuesHe pointed out some of the special Tesla features, like the big touch screen in the car and the updates it gets, just like a phone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like I‚Äôm living in the future,‚Äù he added.Charging the CarBrian was a bit worried about how far the car could go before needing to be charged. He soon found out it wasn‚Äôt a problem.‚ÄúThe range is actually better than I expected. I can go about 250 miles on a full charge, which is more than enough for my daily needs,‚Äù he explained.He had to learn about properly charging the car, which is different from putting gas in a regular car. Now, he starts every day with a fully charged car.What Other People ThinkBrian was interested to see what his friends and family would think about his new car. He was curious if anyone would even notice that he had the cheapest Tesla.‚ÄúIf any of them did, nobody said anything,‚Äù he shared. ‚ÄúEveryone just wants to drive in my car from the future.‚ÄùHis kids love the car too ‚Äî and so does his pooch. ‚ÄúMy dog loves dog mode,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can take him on all my errands now. I‚Äôm really living the dream!‚ÄùLearning About New TechnologyFor Brian, buying this car was also about learning new things. He wanted to understand how electric cars work and be part of making transportation better for the environment.Now, he‚Äôs often the one explaining how electric cars work, encouraging his friends to buy one too.The Money LessonBrian learned something important about money from buying his Tesla.‚ÄúNot to be too corny about it but being wealthy isn‚Äôt about buying the most expensive thing just because you can,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about making smart choices with your money, no matter how much you have.‚ÄùBrian did his own research and discovered the cheapest Tesla model was still a great buy, especially with the added benefit of long-term savings from charging up instead of fueling up. His car is perfect for his everyday needs and helps the environment, but the best part is, he got it for a great price.More From GOBankingRatesDollar Tree: 10 Best New Arrivals for Your Money in JulyIn Less Than a Year, You Might Not Be Able To Afford To Live in These 6 US Housing Markets5 Moves Every Woman Should Consider Before RetirementThis is The Single Most Overlooked Tool for Becoming Debt-FreeThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I‚Äôm a Millionaire: Why I Bought the Cheapest Tesla I Could BuyView comments",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Q2 and H1 sales amounted to respectively 7,902 and 15,645. As we have said before, we expect nothing but growth from the Ford F-150 Lightning in 2024 (at least until Q4). Ford says that the model remains America‚Äôs No. 1 selling electric truck. 62% of Ford F-150 Lightning sales are new to Ford.      Ford Mustang Mach-E Ford Mustang Mach-E sales amounted to 3,497 units in June (down 15% year-over-year). However, in Q2 and H1 sales were up at respectively 12,645 (up 46%) and 22,234 (up 58%). Ford said that 54% of Mustang Mach-E sales are new to Ford, so the model is drawing customers from other brands. The ""gross stock""‚Äîreported by Ford‚Äîincreased in June to 18,000 units, compared to 17,600 a month ago.      Mach-E production in Mexico in June amounted to 5,347 units, 59% fewer than a year ago. The total result year-to-date was 23,022, down 50% year-over-year. We assume that Ford produced less because supply significantly outpaced demand. It seems that it will be a challenging year for the Mach-E. The cumulative production since 2020 exceeded 265,000.      Ford E-Transit Sales of the Ford E-Transit van continued to grow fast, reaching 923 units in June (up 152% year-over-year). In Q2 and H1 sales amounted to respectively 3,410 (up 96%) and 6,301 (up 116%). Ford confirmed that the E-Transit remains the America‚Äôs best-selling electric van. Additionally, the manufacturer revealed that: ""Three of every four E-Transit sales this year are from repeat customers as businesses see for themselves the lower maintenance and fuel costs that come with an electric vehicle."" Soon, the Ford E-Transit lineup will be strengthened by an extended-range version.      Unfortunately, Ford does not report sales of other plug-in models, like the Ford Escape PHEV.

xgJPf3UZYgVD6Nq,Seeking Alpha,bing,Hewlett Packard Enterprise: AI Growth From Cloud Core And Edge; Initiate With 'Buy',https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702432-hewlett-packard-enterprise-ai-growth-from-cloud-core-and-edge-initiate-with-buy,2024-07-04 08:16,2024-07-04 08:27,NVDA,,"JHVEPhoto Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is well positioned to capitalize on AI growth with strong product offerings across server, storage, networking and GreenLake cloud. It is poised to capture growth from both cloud core and edge computing. I anticipate AI is going to become a major growth driver for HPE. As the stock price is undervalued, based on my calculations, I am initiating with a √¢¬Ä¬òBuy√¢¬Ä¬ô rating with a one-year price target of $32 per share. AI Growth from Server, Storage, Networking and GreenLake In Q2 FY24, AI systems generated $900 million in revenue, primary through product sales, as detailed in the chart below. Currently, AI revenue accounts for around 12.5% of total revenues, and it is growing at a fast pace.   HPE Investor Presentation Specifically, AI growth is driven by strong demands for server, storage and GreenLake cloud. I anticipate HPE will continue to grow its AI revenue at a fast pace, reaching more than $5 billion by FY24. Key reasons are as follows:  HPE has a strong backlog of $3.1 billion, driven by strong AI business growth. Currently, the leading time for AI servers is around 6-12 month for HPE, as disclosed over the latest earnings call, and the management expressed the supply constraints were not only Nvidia (NVDA) GPUs, but also data center spaces. Having said that, the company is experiencing an improving supply chain for its AI servers. HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs GreenLake provides edge-to-cloud platform and as-a-service solutions, enabling enterprise customers to perform AI workloads. In Q2, the number of GreenLake customers rose 9% sequentially, driving HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth. As AI workloads in the cloud are growing rapidly currently, I forecast HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs GreenLake will grow at a double-digit rate in revenue in the near future. HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs storage ARR grew over 50% year-over-year in Q2 FY24, benefiting from the ongoing transition from block storage to file storage, boosted by AI. HPE has significant advantages in the enterprise storage market, along with its competitor Dell (DELL). With more workloads in the cloud and AI computing, there is a substantial market for AI storage in the future.  Acquisition of Juniper Networks  HPE anticipates the completion of regulatory approval for its $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks (JNPR) in late 2024 or early 2025. I favor this acquisition as the combination of HPE and Juniper could potentially strengthen the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs competitive advantages in AI market, providing comprehensive solutions from edge to cloud. Juniper could bolster HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs network security and AI-enabled enterprise networking operations ((AIOps)). Juniper√¢¬Ä¬ôs AIOps portfolios could leverage data, cloud-native architecture, and AI related applications for enterprise customers. Additionally, Juniper√¢¬Ä¬ôs cloud management and security solutions could help customers to simplify digitalization and cloud migration. Recent Result and FY25 Outlook HPE released its Q2 result on June 4th, reporting 3.3% revenue growth and 37% ARR growth. My biggest takeaway from the quarter was HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs strong ARR growth, with as-a-service lifetime total contract value exceeding $15 billion. The strong ARR growth indicates HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs growth momentum in AI workloads, as well as the company√¢¬Ä¬ô early success in transitioning its business model. For FY24, the company guides 1-3% constant revenue growth and 0-2% adjusted operating profit growth, as detailed in the chart below.   HPE Investor Presentation For near-term growth, I am considering the following factors:  Server Business: HPE grew its server business by 17.6% in Q2 FY24. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs worth noting that HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs growth rate is lower than Dell√¢¬Ä¬ôs recent 42.5% growth in servers and networking business. The relatively lower growth rate indicates that HPE has higher mix towards legacy server business ((on-premise)) compared to Dell. With the strong demand for AI computing and improving supply chains, I anticipate HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs server business will grow at around 15%+ in the near future. As servers represented more than half of HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs total revenue, servers could potentially contribute more than 7.5% to the topline growth. Hybrid Cloud: The business includes its storage, GreenLake Flex Solutions, Private Cloud, and Software. For Hybrid Cloud business, the company expects slight sequential revenue increase throughout the year. Currently, the business is experiencing some growth headwinds from constrained IT budgets, declining 8.4% year-over-year in the latest quarter. Intelligent Edge offers switching products for local area network, campus, branch and data center. FMI predicts the global network devices market will grow at a CAGR of 5.6% from 2022 to 2032. I think HPE can at lease grow in line with the overall market growth in the near future.  Putting all the pieces together, I anticipate HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs growth could potentially accelerate to 6% from FY25, primary driven by networking, cloud, server and storage businesses, offset by structural business decline in on-premises businesses. Valuation As HPE has already reported two quarters, and the company has a strong backlog and ARR balance, I won√¢¬Ä¬ôt expect any big surprises for its FY24√¢¬Ä¬ôs growth. I assume the company will generate 2% revenue growth in FY24. As analyzed previously, I forecast HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs growth will accelerate to 6% from FY25. HPE has spent tremendous efforts on cost control in the past few years, with its gross margin expanding from 33.7% in FY21 to 35.1% in FY23. The current management team is very disciplined with operating costs. I anticipate the company will deliver 10bps operating leverage from its gross profits in the future. The DCF summary can be found below:   HPE DCF Summary- Author's Calculations The free cash flow from equity is calculated as follows:   HPE FCFE- Author's Calculations The cost of equity is calculated to be 11.9% assuming risk-free rate 4.2% ((US 10Y Treasury Yield)); Beta 1.1 ((Seeking Alpha)); equity risk premium 7%. Discounting all the FCFE, the one-year price target is calculated to be $32 per share, as per my estimate. Key Risks  Juniper Acquisition: As reported by the media in June 2024, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has opened an inquiry to investigate the acquisition, concerned about a substantial lessening of competition. Currently, it is uncertain whether CMA will block the acquisition or force HPE to divest some assets, although it was quite common for CMA to conduct investigations into large acquisitions. H3C Stake Sale: as reported, HPE plans to sell 30% of its stake in China-based H3C for $2.1 billion, with the option to sell its remaining 19%. The stake sale requires approval from Chinese regulators. Considering the rising geopolitical tension between US and China, I view the ownership divestiture as a positive event for HPE, although the regulatory approvals could pose some uncertainties. Competition from Dell and Super Micro Computer (SMCI): in the server market, Dell and Super Micro Computer are respectable competitors, and both companies partner with all major GPU providers including Nvidia, AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Currently, HPE has a strong partnership with Nvidia, but they don√¢¬Ä¬ôt have broad product offerings with AMD and Intel.  End Note  I favor HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs position in server, storage, edge networking as well as cloud, riding the tide of growth from both AI training and inference. The current stock price has not priced in any growth acceleration of HPE√¢¬Ä¬ôs revenue in the future. I view the stock price as significantly undervalued; therefore, I am initiating with a √¢¬Ä¬òBuy√¢¬Ä¬ô rating with a one-year price target of $32 per share.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
13fhyCogs9qZ3GV,Seeking Alpha,google,Wells Fargo: Shareholder Distributions And Regulatory Relief Could Drive Further Upside,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702434-wells-fargo-shareholder-distributions-regulatory-relief-could-drive-further-upside,2024-07-04 08:20,2024-07-04 08:30,WFC,,"ablokhin Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has been experiencing a strong commercial momentum lately and is well-positioned for additional upside due to strategic shifts in its business operations, significant investments in growth areas, and an ongoing transformation under the leadership of CEO Charlie Scharf. As WFC continues to execute on strategic priorities, including (1) expansion and diversification of revenue, (2) pushing operational efficiency and (3) proving regulatory compliance, the bank is expected to generate about $23 billion of pre-tax income in 2024, and $25 billion in 2025. The strong earnings power, paired with a solid CET1, should enable the bank to distribute close to 10% of market cap to investors, annually. Lastly, one of the most significant potential catalysts for Wells Fargo is the expected lifting of regulatory restrictions, including the asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve. The lifting of these restrictions will enable the bank to expand its balance sheet and pursue growth opportunities more aggressively. While a date for the lifting of regulatory restrictions is still outstanding, I argue that it could happen within 2024. On that note, I reiterate a ""Buy"" rating for WFC stock. For context: Wells Fargo stock has outperformed the broader U.S. stock market this year. Since the beginning of the year, WFC shares are up by approximately 21%, compared to a gain of nearly 15% for the S&P 500 (SP500). Seeking Alpha Strategic Shifts and Leadership Transformation Since Charlie Scharf took over as CEO in 2019, Wells Fargo has undergone significant changes aimed at addressing past regulatory issues and positioning the bank for future growth. In that context, Scharf's leadership has been instrumental in transforming Wells Fargo from a regional bank to a more competitive institution with a business mix closer to its larger peers like JPMorgan and Bank of America. The revamping of the leadership team, with 11 of 15 operating committee members hired after Scharf's appointment, has brought in fresh perspectives and expertise, particularly in risk management and technology. While addressing regulatory headwinds and risk management issues, Wells Fargo has made substantial investments in key, value-accretive growth areas such as credit cards, capital markets, and wealth management. For instance, the bank has significantly expanded its credit card portfolio, with card balances growing by 30% from FY19 to FY23. This growth is driven by new product offerings and a focus on high-quality customers, with over 80% of credit card customers having FICO scores above 660. WFC Q1 2024 reporting Meanwhile, in the capital markets sector, Wells Fargo has invested in enhancing its trading and investment banking capabilities. This includes structural changes in how the bank manages its capital markets and advisory businesses. This effort is reflected in a 10% increase in investment banking revenue YoY, reaching $2.1 billion in Q1, 2024. Additionally, trading revenues saw a 15% increase YoY, amounting to $1.8 billion for the same period. Notably, Wells Fargo achieved this growth while being compliant with its $2 trillion balance sheet cap. Improved Efficiency Another critical aspect of Wells Fargo's long-term equity story is improving efficiency and managing expenses. The bank's efficiency ratio is now below 70%, and may trend down to below 60% by 2026, according to consensus estimates collected by Refinitiv. In my view, as a leading retail bank, Wells Fargo is well positioned to drive enormous efficiency gains from the application of GenAI opportunities. Specifically, Wells Fargo has ample room to apply AI for reducing its bloated expense base in consumer facing (customer service) and back-office (compliance) labor costs. This positive outlook for streamlining operations, paired with topline expansion, should notably drive operating leverage and ROIC. Bloomberg NII To Remain High ... Personally, I do not share concerns surrounding NII contraction on the backdrop of deposit cost pressure. Investors should consider that Wells Fargo has one of the best core retail banking and deposit franchises in the U.S., which is evident in its low cost of deposits compared to peers. In my view, this competitive advantage allows the bank to maintain a stable funding base and better manage its net interest income. In fact, over the past few quarters WFC has shown strong NII momentum from reinvesting maturing securities at favorable yields, while maintaining stable commercial deposits and funding. For FY 2024 and FY 2025, I project around $48-49 billion of net interest income. ... Offering A Strong Backdrop For Capital Generation And Distribution In addition to NII, I project $28-30 billion of non interest income for both 2024 and 2025 (2025 likely higher end of the range due to falling rates). That said, with a 65% cost-to income ratio, Wells Fargo should have the earnings power to generate approximately $25 billion of annual pre-tax profit. Wells Fargo's strong capital position provides a strong backdrop for investors to expect capital distributions. The bank's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio currently stands at 11.2%, which is well above the regulatory minimum of 8.9%. This thesis of strong capital has been supported by the recent results of the Fed's annual stress test. In fact, following the stress test results, which proved that WFC remains resilient even amidst severe economic distress, Wells Fargo management increased the quarterly dividend by 14%, to 40 cents per share ($1.6 per share annualized, close to 3% dividend yield). In addition to the dividend, WFC is on track to distribute close to $20 billion of capital through buybacks (almost 10% of market cap), after $6.1 billion of gross buybacks in Q1 2024, and a projected $5 billion of buybacks in Q2. Overall, investors in Wells Fargo shares may thus expect a >10% equity yield for 2024, which is well above (3x) the respective equity yield for the broader S&P 500. Lifting of Regulatory Restrictions Within 2024 Increasingly Likely One of the most significant potential catalysts for Wells Fargo is the expected lifting of regulatory restrictions, including the asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve. The lifting of these restrictions will enable the bank to expand its balance sheet and pursue growth opportunities more aggressively. That said, recent analyses and reports suggest that Wells Fargo has made substantial progress in resolving its regulatory issues, which enhances the likelihood of the asset cap being lifted in the near future. In fact, during recent earnings events, CEO Charlie Scharf has stepped-up his commentary on increased confidence regarding the bank's efforts to address gaps in risk controls, which is a positive signal towards lifting the restrictions. While a date for the lifting of regulatory restrictions is still outstanding, I argue that it could happen within 2024. Investor Takeaway  I see Wells Fargo's strong commercial momentum to continue and project that future upside is underpinned by strategic investments in growth areas, improved efficiency, competitive deposit franchise, and the anticipated lifting of regulatory restrictions. The bank's robust capital position and attractive valuation support the argument for shareholder rewards: As Wells Fargo continues to generate strong earnings, also helped by ongoing NII strength, the bank is well-positioned to deliver superior shareholder returns - likely a greater than 10% equity yield. Lastly, a major potential catalyst for Wells Fargo is the anticipated lifting of regulatory restrictions, specifically the Federal Reserve's cap on WFC's balance sheet. Although no specific date has been set for lifting these restrictions, it is plausible that this could occur within 2024. ""Buy"".",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

ryl8zA63xpybuNb,Seeking Alpha,bing,Why I Am Betting On Ether After The SEC's ETFs Approval,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702433-why-i-am-betting-on-ether-eth-usd-after-secs-etfs-approval-crypto,2024-07-04 08:18,2024-07-04 08:33,ETH,,"gopixa In this article, I describe the Ethereum ecosystem, its use cases and whether or not investors should consider exposure to Ether (ETH-USD), in my opinion. This is not a technical piece, but an article aimed at explaining Ethereum to non-technical but financially savvy folks. I invite readers interested in ETH to do their own due diligence and research further before taking a final decision on whether to invest. Thesis: Ether is digital oil for limited applications, but a high-risk investment worth considering One narrative about Ether (ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) is that it represents √¢¬Ä¬údigital oil√¢¬Ä¬ù, as opposed to Bitcoin representing √¢¬Ä¬údigital gold√¢¬Ä¬ù. I think this narrative has some limitations, but it is overall a good way to understand what Ethereum is in a nutshell. The Ethereum ecosystem today is the second-largest crypto platform (ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind Bitcoin). Applications of the Ethereum platform range from Decentralized Finance to Gaming, Digital Art and Gambling. I will cover these in detail in the article. In this context, ETH is the √¢¬Ä¬úfuel√¢¬Ä¬ù that allows these applications to take place on the Ethereum blockchain. Stretching the √¢¬Ä¬údigital oil√¢¬Ä¬ù narrative, I√¢¬Ä¬ôd say Ethereum is like oil you can only use for certain applications. You might power your lawn mower with it, but you won't be able to drive a truck. To be fair, some of the applications of Ethereum, and especially Decentralized Finance, have the potential to disrupt entire industries and be the basis of a new digital economy, often referred to as √¢¬Ä¬úWeb3√¢¬Ä¬ù. However, when simply looking at the scale of today√¢¬Ä¬ôs Ethereum ecosystem there is no doubt in my mind that applications are still limited compared to √¢¬Ä¬úweb 2.0√¢¬Ä¬ù. In this current digital era, dominated by centralized apps and digital ecosystems, Ethereum's uses are simply not as widespread. Ethereum usage has also somewhat stagnated in the past couple of years when looking at on-chain data. I believe the key issue with Ethereum today from an investment perspective is that its applications - albeit truly fascinating - are still in their infancy. It remains to be seen whether or not, for example, traditional financial institutions can adopt Web3 - and to what extent. Recommending exposure to ETH depends on an investor√¢¬Ä¬ôs risk appetite. Unlike Bitcoin, which I think is easier to understand as a potential global reserve asset, assessing the risks of investing in the Ethereum ecosystem is more challenging as it requires at least some degree of understanding of the technology. I believe a moderate exposure to ETH, as a new technology and a platform with great potential, is beneficial for risk-prone investors willing to put capital at risk and hold for at least five years. As a user of the Ethereum ecosystem, I would rather invest in ETH to gain exposure to blockchain as a technological trend, rather than blockchain thematic ETFs. That's why I have a position in Ether that is roughly 25% that of my Bitcoin position. Bitcoin is my single largest overall investment. However, Investors who are uncomfortable with losing their capital should refrain from investing in ETH, in my view. The (very) basics of the Ethereum blockchain Note: this section covers the very basics of Ethereum and the blockchain technology. If you are already familiar with cryptocurrencies, you might want to skip it and go to my next section, where I cover what I believe are the main applications of the Ethereum platform today. The first fundamental concept to understand is the difference between Ethereum and Ether. Ethereum is the blockchain platform that supports various applications (which I will cover in the next section). ETH is the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, acting as the √¢¬Ä¬úfuel√¢¬Ä¬ù needed to run the blockchain. Investing in ETH is often simplified as √¢¬Ä¬úinvesting in Ethereum√¢¬Ä¬ù, but investing in Ethereum can take different forms. The most obvious one is indeed to buy the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, which √¢¬Ä¬úpowers√¢¬Ä¬ù the entire ecosystem. But investing in Ethereum could also mean being actively involved within the many applications of the Ethereum ecosystem. In this article, I will discuss the merits (and risks) of investing in Ether. When referring to Ethereum as an ecosystem, I will interchangeably use words such as Ethereum √¢¬Ä¬úplatform√¢¬Ä¬ù, √¢¬Ä¬úecosystem√¢¬Ä¬ù, √¢¬Ä¬únetwork√¢¬Ä¬ù or √¢¬Ä¬úblockchain√¢¬Ä¬ù. Readers who are not familiar with cryptocurrencies might wonder what exactly blockchain is. The simplest way to think about blockchain, in my view, is as a decentralized database or a decentralized, very powerful computer. Unlike a traditional database hosted on one machine, the Ethereum blockchain is decentralized and √¢¬Ä¬úhosted√¢¬Ä¬ù by the participants of the blockchain. Any operation (transaction) on the blockchain must be validated on the blockchain itself. For Ethereum, this is done using a √¢¬Ä¬úProof-of-Stake√¢¬Ä¬ù protocol. Proof-of-Stake involves validators who need to √¢¬Ä¬ústake√¢¬Ä¬ù Ether. Staking Ether means locking it up for a period of time, allowing it to serve as a deposit or reward when transactions occur. In this sense, Ether is the √¢¬Ä¬úfuel√¢¬Ä¬ù of Ethereum. To note, up until 2022 the Ethereum blockchain used a √¢¬Ä¬úProof of Work'' protocol, similar to that of Bitcoin. In the past, instead of staking cryptocurrency, validators on the Ethereum blockchain needed to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate a transaction. I will not expand on the reasons why the switch was made in this article, if not just by mentioning that participants in the ecosystems recognized it as a more energy efficient and scalable technology. I will cover these topics again later in the article, when discussing the √¢¬Ä¬úcrypto trilemma√¢¬Ä¬ù. What is the Ethereum platform for? Many articles discussing use cases for the Ethereum ecosystem can be found online. I believe most of them are rather confusing, because they tend to mix actual applications with technologies enabled by the Ethereum blockchain. Also, they sometimes mention futuristic applications that are just wishful thinking at the time of writing. I am a user of the Ethereum ecosystem myself, and below are what I personally see as the 4 main use cases for the platform today. Disclaimer: I have no affiliation whatsoever with any platform, project, or legal entity mentioned in this article. Any platforms mentioned are included solely for informational purposes and based on my personal knowledge of the Ethereum ecosystem. If you are interested in investing or exploring the Ethereum ecosystem, I highly recommend conducting your own research. None of my advice should be considered financial or legal advice. The first, and most important use case in my view, is Decentralized Finance (DeFi). DeFi is an alternative financial system built on the blockchain that operates without financial intermediaries. DeFi allows users to conduct financial transactions like lending, borrowing, trading and earning interest through smart contracts (contracts that self-execute on the blockchain) and decentralized platforms. In my view, DeFi projects today are mostly within the crypto world itself. In other terms, I have seen very few applications of DeFi that go beyond lending, borrowing or earning cryptocurrencies. Examples of well established DeFi projects include:  MakerDAO, a decentralized organization that allows users to create and manage the DAI stablecoin. UniSwap, a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets without intermediaries. Compound Finance, a platform where users can supply their crypto to liquidity pools and receive interest, or borrow against their crypto holdings by paying interest.  There are also cases of DeFi being used instead of Traditional Finance (referred to in the crypto world as √¢¬Ä¬úTradFi√¢¬Ä¬ù). Specifically, some financial institutions are bringing real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain to make them tradeable on the blockchain. This process is known as the √¢¬Ä¬útokenization√¢¬Ä¬ù of assets. In 2018, for example, Austria issued EUR 1.5 Billion in sovereign bonds using the Ethereum blockchain. A more recent example regards Hamilton Lane, a private equity firm that has tokenized $ 2.1 Billion in RWAs using Polygon, an Ethereum √¢¬Ä¬úlayer 2√¢¬Ä¬ù blockchain. The use cases and examples of DeFi adoption are truly fascinating. However, in my opinion, DeFi has not yet significantly replaced traditional finance applications. I believe that when institutions ""tokenize"" real-world assets, they do it to attract crypto enthusiasts and find new investors, rather than to leverage blockchain technology for their existing, non-crypto-friendly clients. I will cover my thoughts on Ethereum adoption in one of the next chapters. The second use case of the Ethereum Blockchain concerns online gaming. Gaming on the blockchain has an overall similar user experience as traditional in-browser or mobile gaming. The main difference in my view is the scarcity and ownership element. Games on the blockchain can offer unique digital items, using Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs). Players can own, trade, and sell in-game assets using the blockchain. This creates opportunities to earn real value from their virtual experiences and enhances transparency in gaming. There are many native games to the Ethereum blockchain. Examples of active gaming projects on the Ethereum blockchain include Gala Games, Axie Infinity, Wreck League, League of Kingdoms and Pirate Nation. Other projects, such as Decentraland or The Sandbox, are metaverse-related, in that they offer full virtual worlds where players can build and craft their own worlds. Overall, blockchain gaming is an industry worth an estimated $ 3 Billion in value, and projected to grow to $ 90 billion by 2030. That compares with an overall gaming industry that is worth north of $ 300 Billion globally at the time of writing. Notably, there have also been rumors about traditional game publishers featuring NFTs in their games and bringing the gaming experience at least partially on the blockchain. EA and Rockstar Games have expressed their interest in NFTs for gaming, but it still remains to be seen whether they will be adopted, when and to what extent. Because of the sheer size of the gaming industry and how well NFTs and the blockchain can be integrated in gaming, I personally believe this is one of the strongest investing narratives for the Ethereum blockchain. That√¢¬Ä¬ôs why I am mentioning it as the second application in my list, just after DeFi. The third use case of the Ethereum Blockchain is Digital Art. Artists can mint their artwork on the blockchain as NFTs, which are unique digital certificates of ownership. NFTs can then be bought, sold, and traded. Each NFT is unique, making it impossible to duplicate or forge, ensuring the authenticity and ownership of digital art. The NFT market has crashed from its height in 2021, with many pieces of digital art native to the blockchain trading at up to 99% less than their all-time highs. However, the market has recovered slightly since then. Disney (DIS) launched √¢¬Ä¬úDisney Pinnacle√¢¬Ä¬ù in 2023, a proprietary marketplace where collectors can purchase NFTs of Disney collectable pins. The entire NFT market capitalization is roughly $ 90 Billion as of the time of writing. Forbes estimates the NFT industry could grow to above $ 230 Billion by 2030. The fourth main use case of the Ethereum blockchain in my view is Gambling. I am not going to cover this use case in detail, nor I am going to link to any platform or project, as gambling is a controversial topic. I think the crypto gambling industry is sometimes tied to gaming or DeFi, with blurred lines between these applications. Estimates of the size of this industry range from as low as $ 250 Million to as high as $ 90 Billion. Considerations on Ethereum-enabled technologies vs. applications I have no doubt that some crypto-enthusiasts might disagree with the above list. Some people might for example disagree with how I have not included Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) as part of the applications of the Ethereum ecosystem. DAOs are, at their core, a way to organize any entity in a decentralized manner based on the participants√¢¬Ä¬ô consensus. The reason why I have not called DAOs out is because, I believe, the vast majority of applications of DAOs relate to Decentralized Finance. Another example could be related to Non-Fungible-Tokens, or NFTs. I have not spelled out NFTs as an application of the Ethereum ecosystem because, in my view, NFTs are rather a technology - used in applications such as gaming and digital art - than an application itself. The same is valid for the Metaverse, which I consider part of the gaming application of the Ethereum blockchain. In other words, I decided to focus my list on what I believe are applications, rather than technologies. Finally, I have excluded from my list applications that, while are indeed theoretically possible, have little to no adoption at the time of writing. It would be possible, for example, to create a voting system on the Ethereum blockchain that a democratic nation could use for elections. However, no country has chosen to do that, so far. Another application of the Ethereum technology that has seen little adoption so far is that related to the verification of digital identity. Instead of relying on centralized databases, identity could be confirmed by using the blockchain. This would make it very difficult, if not virtually impossible, for criminals to fake identities. Experiments in the direction of digital identity exist - most notably with the launch of √¢¬Ä¬úWorld Coin√¢¬Ä¬ù, a cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum blockchain. However, no country has yet adopted blockchain as a technology to verify the identity of its citizens. I hope the examples above will help readers understand what I meant when I mentioned how I find most online literature about Ethereum rather confusing. I believe most online articles are trying to please Google√¢¬Ä¬ôs algorithm, and they are therefore forced to mix and match all buzzwords related to this technology. To what extent is Ethereum being used? Considerations on Ethereum adoption Key to understanding whether a bet on Ether makes sense is to gauge to what extent the Ethereum blockchain (and Ether) is being used in an ever-increasing manner. I believe the best way to understand usage of the Ethereum network is to check on-chain data. One of the advantages of the blockchain technology is that it is highly transparent - in that all transactions are verified on the blockchain and therefore publicly visible. To check activity on the Ethereum blockchain I use one of the free service providers available online, Etherscan.io. Once again, I have no affiliation whatsoever with Etherscan or any other platform mentioned in this article.   Daily Transactions on Ethereum (Etherscan.io) To assess the growth of the Ethereum blockchain, I started looking at Daily Transactions on a 10 year scale. As shown by the chart above, transactions on Ethereum have experienced an almost exponential growth in 2017-2018 - from less than 250K to more than 1 Million in roughly one year. However, since 2021, they have stabilized between 1 and 1.5 Million transactions per day. I see this as mixed news. On the one hand, the Ethereum blockchain remained utilized through the crypto bear market of 2021 and 2022. This shows, in my view, that many applications of Ethereum are resilient, and the technology proves helpful, and it is not only linked to speculation. On the other hand, transactions have stagnated since 2021, and they have not grown even in 2024 year-to-date, despite ETH experiencing a +42% appreciation year-to-date, at the time of writing. I believe this shows that the run in ETH so far has been mostly speculative, while the Ethereum blockchain is still maturing. Unique Addresses on Ethereum (Etherscan.io) Active ERC20 Addresses on Ethereum (Etherscan.io) Other interesting metrics in my view are Unique Addresses and Active ERC20 addresses. An Ethereum address is a unique string of characters used to receive and send Ether and other tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It functions like an account number in a bank, allowing users to receive funds and interact with the blockchain. These two metrics indicate respectively the total and active users of the Ethereum network. As shown by the two charts above, while Ethereum total addresses have kept growing linearly since 2018, Ethereum active addresses have stagnated between 250K and 500K in the last few years. Once again, I believe this shows a mixed scenario. On the one hand, Ethereum has shown resilience and use cases that go beyond speculation. However, growth in total addresses has not been reflected in growth in active addresses yet. This shows in my view how the Ethereum blockchain overall is not maturing very quickly. The Crypto Trilemma and why it√¢¬Ä¬ôs important to understand it before investing in Crypto The crypto trilemma is a concept introduced by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. It refers to the challenge of achieving three crucial attributes of a blockchain network: decentralization, security, and scalability. According to the trilemma, it is difficult for blockchain networks to optimize all three aspects simultaneously. A network can achieve high decentralization and security, but it may sacrifice scalability, leading to slower transaction speeds and higher costs. Conversely, improving scalability might compromise decentralization or security. Finding a balance among these three attributes is a major focus of research in the blockchain industry. The Ethereum blockchain has addressed the trilemma with its update to Ethereum 2.0, switching from a Proof of Work to a Proof of Stake protocol. The trilemma has not been completely solved: fees on the Ethereum network can still be significantly high, leading to question its scalability. Also, becoming an Ethereum validator poses high barriers to entry, leading to questions about the network√¢¬Ä¬ôs security. However, in my opinion, the Ethereum blockchain has achieved a remarkable balance between decentralization, security, and scalability. This is why I personally invest only in ETH and do not allocate significant funds to other blockchain projects, except for Bitcoin, which I believe has a very different investment narrative. I will cover this in the next section. To be clear, many alternatives to the Ethereum blockchain exist - there are thousands of blockchains with their native tokens. Solana (SOL-USD), for example, is a relatively new blockchain project that is experiencing high growth in terms of market cap and native token appreciation. While I do appreciate (and use!) Solana for many applications, I personally believe their approach to the crypto trilemma leaves a lot to be desired in terms of decentralization. Overall, I believe investing in any crypto project requires understanding what√¢¬Ä¬ôs the approach of the project towards the trilemma. Investing in Ether is no exception, and I personally choose it over others given its track record, many applications and smart, equilibrated approach to the trilemma. Understanding the investing narratives of Bitcoin and Ethereum Readers who are interested in the cryptocurrency industry but have limited technical knowledge might ask whether it is ultimately √¢¬Ä¬úbetter√¢¬Ä¬ù to invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum. In my opinion there is such a big difference in terms of investment narrative between Bitcoin and Ethereum, that this question is the equivalent of asking whether it is better to invest in blue chip stocks or junk bonds. Each of these asset types have their own risk profile and characteristics. It is therefore impossible to provide an answer that satisfies everyone. The investing narrative for Bitcoin is relatively easy to understand, in my view. Bitcoin has all the technical characteristics to be an excellent global reserve asset. It is fungible, portable, durable, divisible, secure, easily transactable and - most importantly in my view - scarce. The question is whether global institutions will indeed decide to adopt it, and to what extent, giving it the trust that today only gold and few sovereign fiat currencies enjoy. I covered my investment thesis for Bitcoin in a recent article and I have a bullish target of $ 650,000 / Bitcoin. In the context of my Bitcoin narrative, as long investors understand the why, they do not need to understand the how of the technology behind Bitcoin. In other terms, as long as you understand why Bitcoin possesses the technical characteristics to be a reserve asset, you do not need to understand how it all works. Nor investors need to be actively involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Investors can simply purchase Bitcoin via an ETF, and wait for the asymmetric bet to pay out (if ever). Investing in Ethereum is a different story, in my view. Investors need to understand the technology behind it and the possible applications, in order to gauge whether Ethereum is a bet worth taking. Being a user of the Ethereum network is also an advantage, as it provides a √¢¬Ä¬úfront row seat√¢¬Ä¬ù to gauge just how much the blockchain is being leveraged and utilized. In this context, I think Ether is a higher risk bet than Bitcoin. It remains unclear to what extent its applications can grow and tackle large and profitable markets such as gaming and traditional finance. I personally like this bet, and I have an exposure to Ether that represents roughly 25% of my exposure in Bitcoin. However, investors who are not willing to hold on to their stake for at least 5 years, and those who are not comfortable with losing their investment should better avoid investing in Ether for the time being. For investors willing to get exposed to Ether, the new ETFs that have been recently approved by the SEC represent an easy way to gain exposure to the technology. In my view, these ETFs will be preferable to funds that aim at getting exposure to blockchain technology by investing in a set of cryptocurrencies or tech companies. I might cover these differences in a future article, after Ether ETFs start trading. Regardless of how easy gaining exposure to Ethereum will become, I can only recommend investors to gain exposure to ETH only after thoroughly researching the technology and understanding its risks. Risks of investing in ETH I believe there are two main risks with investing in Ether. The first is that blockchain as a technology might never mature to an extent that will significantly reward token holders. While real life applications exist already, they are still relatively small and I think that blockchain technology has a long way to go to become an integral part of our economic system. The second risk is that the Ethereum blockchain might not be a winner in the long term. New technologies and blockchains are constantly developed, and Ethereum might just succumb to a newcomer. This concept is known as √¢¬Ä¬úFirst Mover Disadvantage√¢¬Ä¬ù in management theory. A notable example is how Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) became an IT leader, despite Xerox being the original inventor of many technologies, such as the user interface, that powered Microsoft's success. While I do personally think Ethereum has the best chances to make it as the winning ecosystem, my assumption may prove wrong with time. There are also further risks linked to being actively involved in the Ethereum blockchain. Scams and frauds of different types are still rampant in the crypto world, and the Ethereum blockchain is no exception. These risks can be avoided if investors decide to passively purchase a soon-to-be-tradable ETH ETF. They should, however, be a consideration for investors deciding to dip their feet into the ecosystem. Conclusion I think risk-prone investors should consider buying ETH as a way to gain exposure to blockchain technology. The Ethereum platform, in my view, is a clear winner of the blockchain ecosystem. It has addressed the crypto trilemma better than other blockchains, and it has by far the most use cases, users and history. For these reasons, I assign a √¢¬Ä¬úBUY√¢¬Ä¬ù to ETH.  However, investing in Ether is still a high-risk bet. It remains to be seen to what extent the Ethereum blockchain can grow and tackle profitable markets such as the gaming and the financial industries. On-chain data such as daily transactions and number of active addresses provide a mixed view. While the Ethereum network has proven to be resilient through crypto bear markets, its usage has been somewhat stagnating in the past years. Investors who are not comfortable with losing their capital and they are not willing to hold for at least five years should avoid this bet, in my opinion.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

After launching on July 5 last year, the social network has reached 175 million monthly active users ‚Äî that‚Äôs a notable achievement. But, after a year, Threads is trying to find its own voice by not being as newsy as Twitter/X and also not being as open as Mastodon or Bluesky ‚Äî at least for now.Over the course of the last year, the Threads team has shipped features at a rapid pace and has also gathered feedback on the social network directly through its users. After the launch, Threads has gained support for multiple profiles, a web app, a Tweetdeck-like interface on the desktop, trending topics in the U.S., and custom controls for mute and quote replies.The company has also made some progress to integrate with the Fediverse. Users can connect their accounts to the ActivityPub protocol. Users can share their posts with the Fediverse. Plus, they can look at likes and replies from the wider Fediverse. But they can‚Äôt follow people from other servers just yet.Why Meta is looking to the fediverse as the future for social mediaHowever, there are a lot of things Meta can learn from other social networks.Following topicsBluesky has done a great job with custom feeds and helping people discover different content. Custom feeds are programmatic feeds that aim to pull posts related to one topic without being just limited to one tag.Threads implemented tags last year. But at times users end up sharing posts with different tags for an event or a trend. Is it WWDC or WWDC 2024 or WWDC 24 or Apple Event? You can save a search term and hope to get relevant and recent posts, but there is no way to combine those. Some kind of provision for this in the API, or a custom list implementation would be a great addition.Last month, Threads made its API widely available to developers. The API enables toolmakers to post content for users and display their own posts within an app.‚ÄúThe Threads API enables businesses to create and publish content on a person‚Äôs behalf on Threads and to display those posts within an app solely to the person who created it,‚Äù Meta wrote as a description for Threads‚Äô API.This doesn‚Äôt allow developers to create third-party apps to consume Threads. We wrote earlier this year that over the last few years, social networks have become stingy about user data. In the process, they have shut down the development of alternative experiences that could help different sets of users.Social networks are getting stingy with their data, leaving third-party developers in the lurchThreads‚Äô rivals like Bluesky and Mastodon have fostered an ecosysm where third-party developers can make their own clients. It‚Äôs not clear if users will be able to pick other Mastodon clients to experience Threads when Threads achieves full integration with the Fediverse. It would be good to get some assurance that Threads is open to allowing third-party apps.Separating Threads and InstagramThreads built a lot of its user base through its Instagram integration. However, with more than 175 million active users, the company can afford to lose its ties with Instagram. Initially, a Threads profile was completely tied to their Instagram account. So you couldn‚Äôt delete your profile without deleting your Instagram account. However, later, the company released an update for users to deactivate or delete one account.You can‚Äôt still create a profile that‚Äôs separate from an Instagram account. Plus, there is no way for you to DM people unless you go to their Instagram.There is hope in this area though. In an interview with Platformer‚Äôs Casey Newton, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that the company is thinking of moving in this direction.‚ÄúMy hope is that Threads gets more independent over time. It‚Äôs still deeply integrated with Instagram ‚Äî you can sign in with the same account, you can automatically follow the same accounts, and we show Threads content on Instagram. But over time, I want it to be more and more independent. We‚Äôre working on things like Threads-only accounts and data separation,‚Äù Mosseri told Platformer.News and politicsThreads and Mosseri have taken a stance that they are not actively promoting or amplifying news and political content on the platform. Despite that, political topics surface in places like trending topics from time to time. Right now, these topics are just concentrated towards U.S. politics, but when they roll out to other regions, there will be times when political content will take over the social network. And the company should hone the product in a way that could handle extremities without suppressing news.X‚Äôs community notes program is not perfect, and often, it makes mistakes or is prone to bias. However, at times, it succeeds in providing useful context. When it comes to news, Mastodon recently rolled out a feature to show bylines linked with the writer‚Äôs account on the social network.The ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù algorithmI‚Äôll admit it. No social network has a perfect algorithm. Video platforms like TikTok might have moved the needle in a positive direction in terms of serving interesting posts.In comparison, Threads‚Äô ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù feed sometimes looks bizarre. Several people have written about strange posts appearing on their feeds that seem out of their interest sphere.More recently, I have been just seeing posts about people asking ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù and talking about how single life or dating is hard. I‚Äôm not sure what I did to trigger this. But Threads really needs to work on making the ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù algorithm more palatable when showing random posts on the timeline.Better local contentTo surface local content, Threads doesn‚Äôt have to look far beyond Instagram, which has developed partnership teams in various countries. Before Elon Musk took over, Twitter also had partnership teams in various regions focusing on surfacing relevant content.Threads rolled out live scores for NBA, MLS, and even Euro 2024. But missed out on the opportunity to engage cricket fans with live scores during the T20 World Cup last month ‚Äî earlier today, the company published a blog post saying that ‚ÄúIndia is one of the most active countries on Threads globally.‚ÄùWhile there are areas of improvement, given the feature release cadence, we might see some of these areas being addressed sooner than later. Threads has acted friendly with Mastodon and hasn‚Äôt really cared about Bluesky. But if we are to believe Mosseri, the ultimate aim is to beat Twitter.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data shows demand for the cryptocurrency has slowly been returning and could soon be reflected in prices. Bitcoin has been wrestling with $70,000 for much of this year, its struggle was exacerbated when miners began selling their bitcoin in greater amounts last month, seeking to cover operating expenses following weeks of depressed transaction fees and the slashing of miners' block reward at the halving . Some larger mining companies have started using their bitcoin reserves to earn yield or hedge their exposure. Now, ""miner capitulation,"" as the forced selling is often called, has reached levels comparable to December 2022, which marked a 7.6% drawdown in the Bitcoin network hash rate ‚Äì or the total computational power used by miners to process transactions ‚Äì and the cycle bottom after the FTX collapse, according to CryptoQuant. ""Miner capitulation has historically marked price bottoms, given that it signals prices are too low for the least efficient miners to be profitable,"" Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, told CNBC. ""After halvings, a drawdown in network hash rate of around 7%-12% has marked the bottom and preceded price rallies. Currently we have a drawdown of 7.7%."" The increase in bitcoin price, however, will depend on growing demand for bitcoin, which usually increases before showing up in prices, he added. Demand slowed this year after a 66% rally in the first quarter, but CryptoQuant data shows that trend has reversed. ""Whale demand is growing at 6% month-over-month currently,"" Moreno said. ""This is typically a high growth rate, so we are already in a high demand growth environment. ‚Ä¶ Last February-March, prices rallied stronger when demand growth surpassed 6% month-over-month growth."" In the past, he added, ""demand has peaked at 10%-12% month-over-month rate, so there is still room to go."" Bitcoin is down 8% for the past three months but still up 44% for the year.

This CNN Opinion series brings you expert viewpoints on how we can better prepare for catastrophes:The billion-dollar disasters around the cornerIn the blink of an eye, a wildfire changed everythingIt‚Äôs time to evacuate. But why won‚Äôt people flee the encroaching disaster?            As a former administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), I‚Äôve experienced a wide variety of disasters up close, including hurricanes, wildfires and a pandemic. I‚Äôve worked with the best of the best in the field of emergency management, and I know firsthand what a difference having dedicated disaster response professionals can make. I‚Äôve also seen the toll that the stress of unrelenting disasters can take on these responders.                When catastrophe arrives at your doorstep, you need someone who is dedicated to helping. That‚Äôs what emergency management professionals do: help people before, during and after disasters. When a hurricane, wildfire, flood or tornado pays a visit, emergency managers are the ones who are there to clean up the mess, restore order and help the community gain a sense of normality afterward.                But in recent years, emergency managers have been asked to deal with a growing roster of disasters, crises and priorities, many beyond our traditional roles.    Pete GaynorPete Gaynor            We have been tasked with managing outbreaks of diseases like Covid-19, mpox and Ebola, providing support at the southern border, handling refugee resettlement and the crisis of homelessness ‚Äî and every time, our profession rises to the occasion and figures it out.¬†We‚Äôve been called on by presidents and county managers, governors and mayors, tribal chiefs and business leaders to solve incredibly complex and difficult problems.                Saying ‚Äúno‚Äù or providing a halfhearted response is not in our DNA, even when the disaster hits too close to home. Dozens of emergency responders to the devastating 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, California, for example, lost their own homes in the blaze yet continued to report for duty and help others.                No matter how exhausted we are or how little we have left to give, we are wired to step up and give even more when disaster strikes.                However, we have a growing problem: Our unsung American heroes are worn out ‚Äî and some are even leaving the disaster response workforce. We are losing more and more of our emergency managers to chronic disaster fatigue, as evidenced by staffing shortfalls at FEMA.                A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that, at the beginning of 2022, FEMA‚Äôs disaster workforce was operating at approximately 65% capacity. At the same time, the prescient report states, FEMA faced ‚Äúan all-time high in disasters and an unparalleled demand on its workforce.‚Äù            Our unsung American heroes are worn out ‚Äî and some are even leaving the disaster response workforce.‚Äù                Pete Gaynor                    The agency was hit hard by losing 20% of its disaster workforce staff in fiscal year 2020. GAO noted that FEMA‚Äôs responsibilities to respond to the pandemic as well as natural disasters ‚Äúcreated burnout for many employees and increased employee attrition.‚Äù And those who have stayed admit exhaustion while holding fast to their commitment to serve others. Having led many disaster responses over the years, I have had to tell some of my best people to go home in the middle of the response.                Responders are carrying the physical fatigue of weathering long hours and difficult working conditions, and that‚Äôs too often compounded by the mental burden of seeing and experiencing trauma. Estimates of the depression rate among disaster response and rescue workers are as high as 53%, according to the National Center for PTSD. After Hurricane Katrina, research on its mental health effects on responders showed that more than a quarter of them reported that they had traumatic experiences such as witnessing death or seeing a friend injured; at least a tenth of the responders reported persistent significant post-traumatic stress symptoms.    As the U.S. is heading into what forecasters say will be an extreme summer ‚Äì from punishing heat waves to severe weather and hurricanes ‚Äì the nation‚Äôs disaster relief agency is expected to run out of money before it‚Äôs even over. CNN's Allison Chichar reports.Clipped From Videovideo          Related videoFEMA is running out of money heading into a destructive weather seasonBurnout, which experts define as ‚Äúa psychological syndrome emerging as a prolonged response to chronic interpersonal stressors on the job,‚Äù is dangerous. A burned-out emergency manager is likely to have difficulty making clear decisions and can struggle with mental well-being, which can adversely affect their job performance. Individuals experiencing burnout can also bring down the morale of a team and undermine organizational performance. On a personal level, burnout has the potential to decrease both longevity and quality of life, in addition to having negative effects on personal health and family relationships.                A study reviewing the state of the disaster workforce published in the Journal of Emergency Management in 2021 found that half of the respondents felt burned out or overextended (at high risk of burnout), reporting symptoms of high emotional exhaustion and cynicism as well as reduced efficacy on the job.                An emergency management workforce struggling with burnout will not be ready to tackle the inevitable disasters on the horizon.

When one disaster or crisis appears to be over, another emerges on the horizon. The demands on the profession have increased from seemingly every direction.                First, the sheer volume of natural disasters continues to multiply. The number of disasters, the intensity, the cost and the frequency have become bone-crushing. Just look at the history of disasters over the past 30 years. According to the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), since 1980 the US has been hit by 387 weather/climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each.¬†In the 10 years from 1980 to 1989, we averaged a bit fewer than four billion-dollar disasters per year. If you fast-forward 30 years to 2019, we started averaging 22 billion-dollar disasters per year.

And the overwhelming majority of disasters such as floods and storms never reach the threshold for a federal disaster declaration, which activates federal aid.                But no matter what size disasters are or the designation they are given, responding to them takes time, energy and resources. Even if you set aside the unsustainable financial cost of disasters and the changing climate driving them, the disaster workload and the human cost on our emergency managers has become untenable.                Second, the persistent addition of non-traditional mission assignments such as managing the opioid crisis or housing instability has further drained our resources.                The recent increase in disaster workload has been playing out against the backdrop of a profession that has been perennially underfunded and understaffed.                When you add in a demanding and unforgiving public and a hyperconnected, sensationalist media landscape, the often-misunderstood job of emergency management becomes exponentially more complex and challenging. We have always shouldered, and will continue to shoulder, a disproportionate amount of responsibility for our increasingly complex and demanding world.

Over the past few years, I have talked to many of my counterparts across the country about this attrition as disasters increase. They see what I‚Äôm seeing: Good emergency managers are leaving for better pay and the slower pace of the private sector, while others are transferring into less-demanding 9-to-5 jobs in other government agencies. Others have decided to retire early.                In the middle of a crisis, we need experienced and expert professionals. If we lose those professionals, we lose the ability to take decisive action in critical moments ‚Äî which can make the outcome of a disaster or crisis worse.                We need to right the ship. Otherwise, the emergency management systems we rely on will fail when our citizens, the community and the nation need them the most.

DotR5up9BXUwz3O,Seeking Alpha,google,"IBM Is A Sleeping Giant, Can It Wake Up? (NYSE:IBM)",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702439-ibm-is-a-sleeping-giant-can-it-wake-up,2024-07-04 08:27,2024-07-04 08:44,IBM,,"hapabapa Introduction International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), colloquially ""Big Blue"" to old timers, and ""IBM"" to everyone Gen X forward, is one of the oldest software companies in the world. It began as a merger of several corporations back in 1911, which became known as the Computer-Tabulating-Recording Company, or the ""CTR Corp.,"" which was later changed to IBM in 1924. It's always exciting to get to write about a company older than my grandparents. Below is its track record since 1962. Data by YCharts Zooming in and you can see a real explosion from 2020 onward, but comparing it to the broader tech sector or the broader US market gives us some benchmarks that do not paint as bright of a picture of IBM. Data by YCharts Fundamental Overview IBM is a large cap corporation, a member of the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (""The Dow"" as my grandad called it). Data by YCharts Despite being below its heights in 2000 or in the mid-2010s, IBM has had a history of delivering steady returns. IBM has returned incredible amounts of equity to shareholders since its market debut. It has also returned a lot of cash, having paid quarterly dividends for the last thirty years and increasing them for at least the last twenty-five, earning it the title of ""Dividend Aristocrat."" Note: IBM is in the upper half of holdings in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL). Data by YCharts Dividends are something IBM is known for. It currently boasts the highest dividend yield of tech companies in the S&P 500, Russell 1000 (which includes SPX), and is only beaten out by one other firm when looking at all large-cap technology companies in the world, Computershare Ltd (OTCPK:CMSQY), which just barely makes it as a large cap with its 10.43B valuation. Note: They are both beat out by Shanghai Baosight Software, another 10B-ish company that yields over 7%, but it only trades as 900926 in Shanghai, so I have no way to call its data with YCharts or Seeking Alpha. Data by YCharts The company itself has a low valuation compared to many of its peers. IBM is below the sector and overall market average when it comes to P/E ratio, which may be surprising to hear for folks mostly familiar with IBM for their advanced AI systems that make it onto national news and family-oriented TV programs like Jeopardy! Data by YCharts In fact, at a PE of 20, IBM sits below the average of every subsector within technology as well. The market is not expecting much growth out of IBM. Figure 1 (Simply Wall St.) Why is IBM so Cheap? So the next question naturally is: why does the market not expect IBM to grow like a normal tech company? My answer is three-fold:  Revenue growth is too slow (or non-existent in the past) Negative FCF from last year makes M&A difficult The market is underestimating IBM and its capabilities  Revenue The best way to introduce the issue here is to just show you the chart. Figure 2 (Grasshopper Stocks) 2020 and 2021 decimated IBM's revenue, and its growth has been on a very slow trajectory since. There is little to celebrate when it comes to IBM's ability to generate revenue. Data by YCharts There are some high points still, such as IBM's (mostly) consistent margins. Data by YCharts Overall, revenue is one of the disappointing aspects of IBM's performance and one that I would be remiss not to note first and foremost when discussing why the market isn't happy with IBM. Cash IBM had a cash problem last year, and it really shows in their cash holdings as well as their FCF. Data by YCharts Up until recently, cash-on-hand has been pretty low, and a resurgence of cash since late last year has shored up some of the potential issues that IBM might've had regarding its ability to pay out its dividend, which it did not fail to do even through the slump in 2022. Data by YCharts A recent trend in tech has been reckless amounts of M&A. I recently wrote an article on Microsoft's M&A practices and why their acquisition of Deepmind's founder has them at the top of the AI game currently. In that article, I discussed how important M&A has been to large tech names like Microsoft and Google over the last few years. To play that game alongside the bigger players, firms like IBM need to have a lot of cash on hand. To shore up some of this extra cash, IBM has been divesting from parts of its business that it wants to divert less resources to. It recently divested from its SaaS customer base in cybersecurity, selling their QRadar book to Palo Alto Networks (PANW) earlier this month. Data by YCharts I believe this is a smart move as ultimately, operational expense slimming could be a very positive catalyst for IBM moving forward. That it something they will need to continue to work on, as the last few years have seen a stagnation of both their overall expenses and their SGA (sales, general, and administrative) expenses. The spread between the two is mostly unchanged since mid-2022. Data by YCharts This could be problematic for IBM as many of its competitors work to reduce their cost of business in order to boost revenue. A History of AI Frontiers The first major event in collective US memory regarding AI is ""Deep Blue,"" the first chess-playing bot to beat a world champion chess player. It beat Garry Kasparov, at the time a chess player for the Russian Federation and unequivocally the best in the world. They tied three games and Deep Blue won two.   Kasparov v. Deep Blue, 1997 (Adam Nadel) Deep Blue playing chess was the first major public showcase of algorithmic systems, what would become known as ""bots."" This symbolic AI (not based primarily on machine learning) was a major step at the time, and first in the computing world. The next time IBM made major public acclaim for a bot comes in 2011, with a new AI named Watson, who beat Ken Jennings and Brad Rudder on Jeopardy! For those that don't know, those two were at the time, the best players of all time.   Ken Jennings (L) v. Watson v. Brad Rudder (R), 2011 (CNN) Watson, playing in Jeopardy! in 2011 was one of the public's first views of natural language processing, which was a frontier at the time. Today, the Watson name is used by IBM in their B2B enterprise services. They've gone as far as naming their new data platform ""watsonx."" Note: yes, watsonx is all lower case on purpose. I don't know why IBM chose that. The potential I see in IBM's business is not watsonx, actually. Their suite, to my mostly untrained eyes (I am not an expert in data analysis or AI), looks little different from the offerings of other competitors like Snowflake Inc (SNOW) or Palantir Technologies (PLTR). What I'm most interested in is Granite, which was released this year. Meet Granite Granite is IBM and Red Hat's project to democratize generative AI, by providing an open-source platform for developers to build AI models and share the training sets they are able to work with. This move is welcome in my opinion, as more access to technology and tools is usually better for innovation. The current way AI models are being built and trained, especially the largest ones, like ChatGPT (OpenAI via MSFT)and Gemini (GOOGL), is that they are stored in silos and guarded by gatekeepers, unable to be worked on by private and small time developers. IBM has launched InstructLab, which is the portal to using Granite. The tool itself is useful for running chat bots and other generative tasks, and is open to the public to work on and contribute to. Granite has the ability to be a project like Android has been for Google, where developers using the platform become ""ecosystem bound"" and end up using other Google services because they are already developing on the open-source Android platform. IBM has the ability to, and seems to be actively working toward, integrating watsonx and its other revenue-generating systems with Granite. As developers seek out platforms not held by massive tech companies who want to hoard their data and the tools they may create on these platforms (you do not own any plugins you build for ChatGPT as an example), Granite currently stands as the best choice in transparency, speed in tasks like speculative decoding, and working with code.   Figure 3 (IBM) It's really, really good at writing code. Granite knows 116 programming languages across half a trillion tokens.   Figure 4 (IBM) Conclusion IBM is a monolith in the technology world, but it is a sleeping giant. There is a lot of potential in IBM's systems and their researchers have a history of working on the frontiers of projects. As of right now, I am issuing IBM a hold rating as I believe that it has similar long term potential to the broader market and am not considering adding it to my equities portfolio, but I wouldn't discount IBM or bet against their ability capitalize on some of the high points I pointed out in this article. IBM has the assets and the ability to capitalize on these strengths, but have shown no clear signs of doing that so far. All there is to do now is wait and see if they wake up.

1d6ZFNeCucxf0Vk,Seeking Alpha,bing,SPLG: More Room For Extension Of Bull Run,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702443-splg-more-room-for-extension-of-bull-run,2024-07-04 08:39,2024-07-04 08:48,NVDA,,"ARK NEYMAN/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Despite healthy gains and being in a state of bull run for more than 20 months, I believe that the uptrend is likely to last for a longer time. There are a number of reasons to believe that the bull run will last for a longer time, including two consecutive years of double-digit earnings growth for the S&P 500, robust tech performance, and modest economic growth. Meanwhile, besides tail events, the risk factor appears limited. Therefore, I'm upgrading my buy rating on SPDR√Ç¬Æ Portfolio S&P 500√Ç¬Æ ETF (NYSEARCA:SPLG) to a buy from hold. Prospects for a Long Lasting Bull Run are High S&P 500 current bull run (Seeking Alpha) The S&P 500 rallied nearly 45% in the current bull run on the back of the tech-driven gains along with a positive contribution from other sectors. The index is currently trading around a record 5,500 points, with market pundits having a mixed view about the outlook. Some are expecting the S&P 500 to end the year around 6,000 points while others anticipate a correction. For instance, Piper Sandler's chief market technician anticipates a 10% correction this summer from the current level. In my view, the case for the extension of the bull run is strong with a limited downside risk. This is because of the robust fundamentals, including double-digit earnings growth power and economic stabilization. Earnings Growth is the Key Catalyst S&P 500 earnings growth history (FactSet) Earnings growth has always been the biggest driver of investor confidence in the broader market index. After sluggish earnings growth in 2023, FactSet data shows that the S&P 500 earnings are expected to increase at a double-digit rate for the two consecutive years. In 2024 and 2025, earnings are forecasted to increase around 11% and 14%, respectively. Last time, the index experienced two consecutive years of double-digit earnings growth in 2017 and 2018. Historical stock price trends reflect that stock prices rally significantly whenever earnings increase at a solid pace. For instance, the S&P 500 rallied nearly 19% in fiscal 2017 when earnings grew by around 11% while the index soared 43% between 2017 and 2019. Similarly, the S&P 500 surged significantly in 2021 due to earnings growth of around 47%. Besides strengthening investor confidence in stocks, earnings growth always has multiple effects on corporations and shareholder returns. For instance, higher earnings growth enhances corporations' cash generation potential, enabling them to fund new growth opportunities along with returning healthy cash to shareholders. For instance, Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), which saw earnings growth of nearly 200% in 2023 and a 117% increase in the first quarter, repurchased a massive $14.6 billion of its Class A common stock in the latest quarter. The earnings performance in the past quarters enabled it to pile billions of dollars in cash reserves. In the latest quarter, the company produced $12.5 billion in free cash flow and was sitting on $58 billion in cash and market securities. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) have also been generating substantial free cash flows. For example, NVIDIA ended the March quarter with $31 billion in cash, cash equivalent and market securities compared to $25 billion in the previous quarter. The robust growth in cash position is backed by its earning growth power and a significant increase in free cash flow. NVIDIA's March quarter non-GAAP earnings per share grew 19% sequentially and 461% year over year. Consequently, the company produced a whopping $14.9 billion in free cash flow compared to $11.2 billion in the previous quarter and $2.6 billion in the year ago period. Meanwhile, the company's long-term and short-term debt stood around $8.5 and $1.2 billion, respectively. 2024 earnings growth forecast (FactSet) Furthermore, another important factor is that the S&P 500 earnings growth in 2024 and 2025 is expected to be driven by high growth sectors, such as communications, information technology, and consumer cyclicals. Solid performance from these sectors is crucial for the bull run because these sectors collectively represent almost half of the S&P 500 weight and performed exceptionally so far in the current bull run. Data shows that mega caps are once again expected to lead the earnings growth trend for the S&P 500 in 2024 and 2025. For example, NVIDIA is expected to generate 100% earnings growth in 2024 while other mega-cap tech companies including Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft are expected to produce double-digit earnings growth. Earning growth of other key sectors, such as financials, healthcare, utilities, and industrials, is also expected to remain strong. Fed's Soft Landing and Economic Stabilization Although the Fed has delayed its rate cuts and now anticipates only 1 cut later in 2024, I believe the market has adapted to high rates. This is clearly reflected in the robust performance of the financial sector. For instance, after posting record profits in 2023, banks and financial services companies witnessed significant growth in their profits and a decline in provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2024. Apparently, there is no risk of a financial crisis. The bank's strategy of increasing interest on deposits helped them improve deposits in the past months. Fed dot plot (Federal Reserve) Nevertheless, the market is now closer to experiencing a first rate cut in the second half of 2024 and multiple cuts in 2025, which I believe will boost investor confidence and business activities. In addition, the prospects for a soft landing are also high because the Fed so far appears successful in slashing inflation without sending the economy into a recession. Overall, the business conditions are likely to remain strong, with a potential GDP growth rate of 2.2% for the second quarter and around 2% for the full year. Why Is SPLG the Right Investment Vehicle? There are a number of investment options to track the large-cap US equity market. SPDR√Ç¬Æ S&P 500√Ç¬Æ ETF Trust (SPY) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) are among the most popular options given their massive assets under management of $1.4 trillion and $550 billion, respectively. However, I believe SPLG could also be a solid ETF to track the S&P 500 bull run. Although their portfolio structure, share price performance, and dividend returns are the same, SPLG appears attractive due to its low expense ratio and cheap share price compared to its peers. SPLG's expense ratio is 0.02% compared to SPY's 0.09% and VOO's 0.03%. SPLG, SPY and VOO share price (Seeking Alpha Furthermore, SPLG appears like a cheap way of tracking the S&P 500. Its share price is currently around $64 compared to SPY's $540 per share and VOO's $500 per share. Cheap share price matters a lot because it enables investors to buy a large number of shares. For instance, with a capital of $100K, investors can buy 1562 shares of SPLG. Meanwhile, with the same amount, investors can buy only 200 shares of VOO and 184 shares of SPY. Even if with the same amount of total funds investors obtain an identical ownership in the S&P 500 based on percentage, the number of shares matters for various reasons, including dividends and trading flexibility. As companies and funds offer dividends on a per share basis, the numbers of shares determine the amount of the total dividend return. A large number of shares also increases trading flexibility. For instance, with a large number of shares, investors can be in a better position to sell some percentage of shares to capitalize on the recent surge or reduce the impact potential downside while holding their exposure to the index. Risk Factors to Consider The biggest risk factor in my view is lofty valuations. The S&P 500 is currently trading above its 10-year average based on the trailing and forward earnings. On the positive side, the ratio has been cooling due to a solid earnings growth outlook. Currently, the S&P 500 is trading around 22.66 times forward earnings compared to 23.41x in the last quarter and 26.26x in the year ago period. As earnings for 2025 are likely to increase nearly 14% year-over-year, it appears that earnings will continue to offer support to the bull run. Moreover, the Fed's policy of holding rates at peak levels for a longer time could also negatively impact stock markets. In Conclusion  Despite one of the fastest rate hike policies, the US stock market performed exceptionally in the last year and year to date because of robust tech stocks' performance. The trend is likely to continue in the second half and over the long term because of the robust demand for tech-related products and artificial intelligence. Moreover, improving financial forecasts of non-tech stocks will also improve the breadth of the bull run. Overall, initiating, holding, or increasing an exposure in the S&P 500 index through ETFs like SPLG could be a prudent strategy. Its cheap share price, high liquidity, and low expense ratio make it a solid investment vehicle to track the S&P 500.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
1l6m29Y155jw3hd,The Motley Fool,google,Apple or Nvidia: Which Will Get to $4 Trillion First?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/04/apple-or-nvidia-which-will-get-to-4-trillion-first/,2024-07-04 08:49,2024-07-04 08:53,AAPL,,"Nvidia (NVDA 4.57%) recently hit a $3 trillion market cap and is now among the three most valuable companies in the world. Right above it in valuation is Apple (AAPL 0.58%), with a market cap of just under $3.4 trillion, while Microsoft is currently in the top spot at just over $3.4 trillion.Though Microsoft is a tech stalwart and a safe stock, I think Apple and Nvidia both possess better growth prospects in the long run. So which of them is the most likely to reach a $4 trillion valuation first?Nvidia sports a mammoth growth rateIt's hard to bet against Nvidia when you consider just how well its business has performed of late. The company is the leading provider of the artificial intelligence (AI) chips that other tech companies need to develop their next-gen software and models. And with AI infrastructure and development still in its early stages, Nvidia could be on the cusp of much more growth.That's in stark contrast to Apple, which has been struggling lately to grow its top line at all.Quarterly revenue growth data by YCharts.But there is reason to expect that the gap between these growth rates will shrink. While Nvidia is a growth beast, it isn't likely to continue tripling its revenue on a year-over-year basis. As it starts lapping its latest huge numbers, it will become more difficult for it to keep its growth rate so high. And with so many companies loading up on AI chips, Nvidia may be punching above its weight right now. As more competing chips come to market in quantity and chip buyers potentially ease up on their AI-related spending, its growth rate could come down drastically.On the flip side, Apple's growth rate should improve thanks to its recently unveiled Apple Intelligence, which will inject AI capabilities into its latest iPhones, Macs, and iPads. That will give users an incentive to get the latest Apple devices when they come out later this year, so it could be the catalyst for a strong upgrade cycle. As Apple dives deeper into AI and enhances its services, it has the potential to tap into more growth opportunities down the road.Apple has the friendlier valuationWhat may be the biggest impediment for Nvidia's stock to rally much higher in the near future is its extremely high valuation of more than 70 times earnings.AAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts.Trading at a much more modest P/E ratio of around 34, Apple could have more room to rise, especially if its growth rate improves. Meanwhile, Nvidia's multiple means it will have a high bar to meet each and every time it reports earnings. That leaves the stock vulnerable to a sell-off should it have a quarter that falls short of expectations or if management offers a forecast that isn't sufficiently rosy.While things are going well for Nvidia today, that doesn't mean it will be able to maintain its current pace.My prediction: Apple hits $4 trillion firstBoth of these stocks make for good long-term investments, but if I were buying shares today, I would pick Apple over Nvidia.There is a lot of excitement around Nvidia now, and that has me concerned that expectations for it may have climbed too high. Apple may not be as popular with growth investors today, but it shouldn't be counted out as it still has a lot more room for growth left.And Apple is the stock that I think will hit $4 trillion first, beating out both Microsoft and Nvidia.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

""I now get the chance to stop people,"" Visioli told BBC Sport. ""In the amateurs you never set your feet, you√¢¬Ä¬ôre constantly bouncing around but now I have time to pretty much do what I want and I√¢¬Ä¬ôm catching people.""The Guildford-born boxer, who lives in Aldershot, won Amateur Boxing Association (ABA) titles across two weight classes and turned professional in 2023 after signing with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing at the age of 20. His professional debut was in Dublin on the undercard of Chantelle Cameron v Katie Taylor 2 in November 2023 where he produced a stunning first-round knockout, following it up with another in his second pro fight just months later.A smile appeared on Visioli's face when asked if he was ever keen to stay amateur for longer to give him another chance of representing Great Britain at the Olympic games. ""The Olympics were always a dream of mine,"" he said. ""I had trials with GB and they decided not to take me, they put me on a development squad which was strange because they took boys that didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt even win the nationals.""I went up a weight class and beat the GB boy in the final that was on the podium squad. I easily beat him, won all three rounds and got a unanimous decision but they didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt take me."" Following this disappointment, he decided to take matters into his own hands and kickstart his professional career. With the help of former IBF flyweight champion Sunny Edwards, Visioli found a manager and penned a deal with Hearn.""Sunny Edwards recommended his manager and he said he had his eye on me for a while,"" Visioli added. ""When GB found out I was going pro they called me up, they said they wanted to take me but I said I wouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt do it, why would you want me now and not then?""On Saturday, Visioli fights his fourth professional bout on the undercard of Johnny Fisher v Alen Babic at the Copperbox Arena in London. He takes on Tanzania's Tampela Maharusi - who has 10 wins and six defeats in his career.""It√¢¬Ä¬ôs another good step up for me,"" Visioli said.""It√¢¬Ä¬ôs good to have a decent opponent who has been in there with some skilled fighters.""I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt like to say too much but you√¢¬Ä¬ôll see a class performance, I√¢¬Ä¬ôm going in there to get that W.""",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
BIgRkJY5MkcPYMs,Seeking Alpha,bing,Nvidia: Growing Risks And Current Valuation Make It A Hold,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702449-nvidia-stock-growing-risks-current-valuation-make-hold,2024-07-04 09:06,2024-07-04 09:07,NVDA,,"mikkelwilliam/E+ via Getty Images Why Does Nvidia Stock Just Keep Climbing? My previous article on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) back in March argued that despite the stock√¢¬Ä¬ôs meteoric rise, the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs quality and expected performance were reasonable enough to justify its premium price. Since then, the stock has resumed its upward march nearly 50%, briefly making Nvidia the most valuable company in the world. What keeps fueling such outperformance? Not much has changed in the past four months for Nvidia. The three themes mentioned in my last article (euphoric sentiment around AI, Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs market positioning, and exceeding expectations), have all showed little sign of slowing. The generative AI (gen-AI) theme has been the backbone of a soaring market that is on pace to match its incredible performance in 2023, currently up 15% year-to-date (S&P 500). Despite many companies doing well the past two years, much of the market√¢¬Ä¬ôs strength is in just a handful of mega-cap tech companies leading the AI race. Since the short-lived dip in October of 2023, over 50% of the S&P 500√¢¬Ä¬ôs gains are attributable to Nvidia, other semiconductor companies, and the √¢¬Ä¬òFab Five√¢¬Ä¬ô.   Financial Times - Unhedged What√¢¬Ä¬ôs more is, in the past three months alone, these large tech companies are taking credit for more and more of the rally, while the rest of the S&P 500 has been flat or giving up some gains:   Financial Times - Unhedged Investors seem to be placing big bets that AI has the power to transform businesses and economies √¢¬Ä¬ì and that these mega tech companies will be the primary beneficiaries. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who√¢¬Ä¬ôs become somewhat of a celebrity, has helped fuel this excitement with his rhetoric around gen-AI: The next industrial revolution has begun√¢¬Ä¬¶ Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence. AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost and energy efficient while expanding revenue opportunities. The other two themes, Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs market position and exceeding expectations, have also remained strong. Nvidia once again crushed estimates in Q1, adding to its streak of 8 consecutive quarterly beats. Data Center revenue and bottom-line profitability were the stars last quarter:   NVDA Q1 Results Doc These are eye-popping growth rates for a company churning out over $25B in quarterly revenue, yet the trend isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt stopping. Management is guiding for about $28B in Q2 revenue, representing Y/Y growth of 107%. CFO Kress said much of the quarter√¢¬Ä¬ôs Data Center revenue came from its older Hopper GPU, the H100; yet the company is still ramping up its H200 processor, recently launched its highest performing superchip (Blackwell), and expects demand to continue outpacing supply for each product. Nvidia has not let up from dominating the Accelerated Computing market and outperforming already lofty expectations √¢¬Ä¬ì making its stock a hot commodity. So√¢¬Ä¬¶ Is Nvidia in a Bubble? The widely understood definition of a bubble is when the price of a stock, asset, or even an entire market exceeds its fundamental value by a wide margin. Value is often measured using price relative multiples like the price-to-earnings ratio, but these aren√¢¬Ä¬ôt useful when determining if price has disconnected from fundamental value. Fundamental value is most commonly assessed as the present value of expected cash flows through a discounted cash flow (√¢¬Ä¬òDCF√¢¬Ä¬ô) model, but this only gives us a snapshot of value at a point in time and relies on assumptions. Instead, to judge if Nvidia is in bubble territory, we can look at how price has tracked two common fundamentals over time: earnings per share (√¢¬Ä¬òEPS√¢¬Ä¬ô) and free cash flow per share. Both reflect any impacts of dilution, and free cash flow is less susceptible to manipulation.   YCharts We can see from the above chart that growth in these fundamentals have held incredibly close with Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs stock price the past 3 years. Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs performance has prompted recent comparisons to Cisco (CSCO), a poster child of the infamous Dot-Com bubble which saw the NASDAQ rise 800% between 1995 and 2000, only to give up 78% off its gains by 2002. The comparison is not unfounded, as the companies do have several things in common:  Market-wide excitement around a revolutionary technology, leading to a broader rally. Hardware/computing provider for the technology Passed Microsoft as the most valuable company Leader by market share in its respective market Benefited from investments before the industry became profitable  It√¢¬Ä¬ôs easy to assume the companies are directly comparable, take a look at their price charts, and conclude Nvidia is in a bubble. But digging deeper, we see that Cisco√¢¬Ä¬ôs fundamentals weren√¢¬Ä¬ôt nearly as strong as Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs during that period:   YCharts The time frame matters as this chart ends near Cisco√¢¬Ä¬ôs peak, but as it shows, Cisco√¢¬Ä¬ôs fundamentals began lagging its stock price a year or so earlier. We have yet to see this happen to Nvidia. Even though Nvidia doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt appear to be in a stock bubble as we have it defined, high expectations around AI√¢¬Ä¬ôs prospects put the company at risk of entering a demand bubble. A Demand Bubble? The global AI market is expected to reach $800B+ by 2030 according to Statista. Though there is overlap, the Data Center market is also projected to be half-a-billion dollars by 2028. Nvidia itself projects a long-term total addressable market of $1 trillion across its product suite. Even with nearly $80B in TTM revenue, this would equate to only an 8% market penetration. The runway and optimism for AI-related markets, and Nvidia, are undoubtedly high. Even with a nearly 80% share in GPUs and a formidable competitive position, can the company continue exceeding these expectations? If not, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs possible Nvidia could be in a demand bubble. As we√¢¬Ä¬ôve seen, Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs stock price has been a magnet to underlying fundamentals, but this may be beginning to change. Revenue and earnings growth estimates for Nvidia look to be normalizing with analysts expecting growth between 20% and 30% by FY 2026 √¢¬Ä¬ì quite moderate given its recent numbers. As a result, Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs forward PE ratio has jumped 50% since March, indicating valuation has recently been more influenced by multiple expansion rather than forward growth and fundamentals.   YCharts When we look back at the ratio over three years, we can see how Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs forward growth expectations drove down the multiple (denominator got bigger), usually after the company reported earnings and guidance revisions. But this wasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt as dramatic last quarter:   YCharts The market looks to be implying higher and higher expectations in the price, putting more pressure on Nvidia to continue outperforming in a big way. While I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt doubt Nvidia will continue dominating its addressable market, and near-term demand continues to outpace supply, there are a handful of risks to its medium/long-term demand which could make it underperform expectations. The first risk is uncertainty around the synergies of some AI use cases, both in terms of profitability and timeline. The predictable result would be less future demand for Nvidia, and potentially an oversupply of inventory.   NVDA Q1 10Q  NVDA Q1 10Q Like the internet in the late 90s, many companies are touting AI√¢¬Ä¬ôs potential to reshape their businesses and generate profits. And like the internet, there were a handful of clear winners, lots of losers, and some that succeeded over time. The market even appears to be more selective with AI stocks as of late: About 60 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 have risen this year, but more than half the stocks included in Citi√¢¬Ä¬ôs √¢¬Ä¬úAI Winners Basket√¢¬Ä¬ù √¢¬Ä¬î an index based on the names that were garnering the most excitement among the bank√¢¬Ä¬ôs clients last year √¢¬Ä¬î have declined. More than three-quarters of companies in the AI basket had climbed in 2023. So far, the handful of winners includes Nvidia, semiconductor peers, and the √¢¬Ä¬òFab Five√¢¬Ä¬ô as we saw √¢¬Ä¬ì which actually unveils another risk to Nvidia: a large portion of Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs revenues are expenses for the √¢¬Ä¬òFab Five√¢¬Ä¬ô. 40% of Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs revenue comes from Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google √¢¬Ä¬ì each of which have committed billions in capex to build AI infrastructure, but not nearly enough as Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs revenues are expected to grow:   Paulsen Perspectives Substack Nvidia relies heavily on these hyperscalers for growth, yet each of these firms are also investing billions in internal AI capabilities to reduce reliance on Nvidia. Additionally, most of them compete with Nvidia directly in software, gen-AI applications, or even chips like Google√¢¬Ä¬ôs TPU. This also doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt include more direct competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTL) which may be able to compete on price as inferencing overtakes training in AI-workloads. The reason being, inferencing generally takes less computing power than training. Should spend from these major customers dry up and competition increase, Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs future demand is at risk. Another potential obstacle to chip demand is data center build out. A credit research report on Nvidia by Barclays pointed out that once databases are built, less compute power is required for deployment. Especially as a higher percentage of workflows move to inferencing. AI chip demand will eventually normalize once the initial training build has been completed. The inference phase of AI is going to require less computing power than the training phase. High-powered PCs and phones could be capable enough to run inferences locally, reducing the need for growing GPU plants. As the market sifts the wheat from the chaff in AI and data centers are built out further, Nvidia is more susceptible to swings, and possibly a cliff, in demand. Expected Value We have seen the market√¢¬Ä¬ôs confidence in Nvidia as evidenced by its climbing stock price in addition to some risks to the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs future demand, but how well exactly does the market expect it to perform? And for how long? The Expectations Investing framework provides a useful methodology for measuring and judging the market√¢¬Ä¬ôs implied expectations. Starting with the current stock price and then leveraging a reverse DCF model, we can assess the market√¢¬Ä¬ôs expectations for Nvidia. Our starting inputs are consensus estimates for revenue growth and operating profit margin. Analysts expect revenue growth near 100% for this FY 2025 tapering down to just under 20% in FY 2027, so I used an average of 45%. Nvidia achieved an operating margin of nearly 60% the past twelve months, but I expect it to normalize around 50%. Other inputs include the cash tax rate, working capital investment, fixed capital investment, depreciation & amortization, and inflation √¢¬Ä¬ì each of which I estimated using historical averages or most recently reported figures. I calculated the cost of capital using the CAPM model for cost of equity (beta of 1.5, risk free rate of 4%, equity risk premium of 4%), a 2.3% after-tax cost of debt, and Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs current capital structure. Here are my inputs:   Author These numbers then flow into a reverse DCF model which calculates the shareholder value per share for each projected year and the market-implied forecast period (√¢¬Ä¬òMIFP√¢¬Ä¬ô) or the competitive advantage period (√¢¬Ä¬òCAP√¢¬Ä¬ô). The MIFP or CAP is the number of years the market expects a company to generate returns above the cost of capital, i.e. how long the company will produce the inputted operating value drivers. For Nvidia, the MIFP is between 5 and 6 years.   Author This means that to justify the current stock price, Nvidia would need to grow revenues at 45% for about the next 6 years and maintain a 50% operating margin. The result would be $740 billion in revenues by 2030, or about 90% of the projected 2030 global AI market we saw earlier. And even with last year√¢¬Ä¬ôs 125% topline growth, Nvidia averaged only 40% annual revenue growth over the last 5 years. Those are high expectations, especially at Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs current size. Operating margins of 50% for 6 years are also a big hurdle given increasing competition, which tends to eat away at margins over time. To judge whether Nvidia is worth buying, we can calculate its expected value based on scenarios and assigned probabilities. I estimated a high and low scenario for the operating value drivers and calculated the shareholder value at 6 years for each. Then I assigned probabilities for the consensus (current stock price) and the scenarios. I view the high case as low probability given the already lofty expectations in the consensus view. Nvidia tends to outperform expectations, so I weighted the consensus at a 40% probability. Finally, I gave the low case a 50% probability, which I view as most likely given the increasing risks to demand and size limitations on Nvidia to produce such high growth. The result was an expected value of $106.82. Nvidia looks overpriced by about 14% of fair value.   Author A Risky Bet On both sides of the Nvidia debate, there remains a whole lot of uncertainty. I have mentioned some risks I see to demand, but the potential of AI is not easy to estimate in the short term, just like the internet. If it happens to be the start of a new √¢¬Ä¬òIndustrial Revolution√¢¬Ä¬ô, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs hard to project how well Nvidia could continue to do. There is also uncertainty around timing. Even if demand does drop eventually, it may take a few years or more. Or demand could pick up as use-cases evolve and Nvidia innovates. Even though Nvidia appears to be overextended with high baked-in expectations, betting against the company is risky. The stock has shown incredible momentum and the company is high quality with a massive moat. Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs CEO Huang is a visionary, an executor, and an effective capital allocator. Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs astonishing growth and returns on invested capital averaging about 30% the past decade are all the evidence needed. The company has also stockpiled $30B in cash for further investment in growth. Nvidia has maintained a near 80% market share in GPUs with first-mover advantages. Additionally, big tech companies have increasingly become hard to displace while taking more of the pie in their respective industries.  Nonetheless, Nvidia√¢¬Ä¬ôs growing risks and current valuation make the stock a hold in my view. A great company can be a bad investment if paid too high a price for.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grab a coffee ‚Äî or a champagne if you‚Äôre feeling fancy ‚Äî and let me take you on a cross-country tour of the best states to strike it rich, as seen through the eyes of someone who‚Äôs done just that.‚ÄùWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.CaliforniaFor Meursing, it‚Äôs a Golden State of mind. California dreaming can end up being California earning, if you know how to work it correctly.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start our journey in California, where I built Premier Staff from the ground up,‚Äù began Meursing. ‚ÄúNow, I know what you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äî ‚ÄòDaniel, isn‚Äôt California notorious for high taxes and cost of living?‚Äô And you‚Äôre not wrong. But here‚Äôs the thing: sometimes you have to spend money to make money, and California offers opportunities that can make those high costs seem like pocket change.‚ÄùMeursing offered up Los Angeles as a prime example of a city that offers the potential to get rich, provided you are able to keep up.‚ÄúThis city isn‚Äôt just about Hollywood glamour [sic],‚Äù said Meursing, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a melting pot of industries and opportunities. One day, you‚Äôre staffing a Ferrari launch event, the next you‚Äôre coordinating logistics for a Netflix premiere. The diversity of clientele here is like a buffet of business opportunities ‚Äî and trust me, I‚Äôve learned to pile my plate high.‚Äù‚ÄúI remember the day we landed our first big Hollywood contract,‚Äù Meursing recalled. ‚ÄúWe were tasked with staffing the Oscars after-party-talk about a make-or-break moment! As I watched our team seamlessly navigate the crowd of A-listers, I realized that California wasn‚Äôt just a state ‚Äî it was a state of mind. A place where dreams are currency and networking is the exchange rate.‚ÄùMeursing claimed that in California, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not just building a business ‚Äî you‚Äôre crafting a lifestyle‚Äù that goes beyond the sizzle and shine of Tinsel Town.Story continues‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äôs startup ecosystem is like a fertile soil where ideas can grow into empires,‚Äù Meursing added, noting the state‚Äôs progressive policies and focus on innovation create an environment where taking risks is not just encouraged ‚Äî it is what is expected.Learn More: Dave Ramsey‚Äôs Best Passive Income Ideas for 2024 ‚Äî 15 ‚ÄòSteady, Profitable‚Äô Ways To Build Wealth FastTexasOr, in Meursing‚Äôs terminology: The Lone Star State of Opportunity.‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs mosey on down to Texas, a state that‚Äôs been on my radar for expansion,‚Äù Meursing said. That‚Äôs due to two words: business friendly.‚ÄúTexas is like that generous uncle at a family barbecue ‚Äî always ready to help you out and never asking for too much in return,‚Äù Meursing described. ‚ÄúThe lack of state income tax in Texas is like music to any entrepreneur‚Äôs ears. It‚Äôs as if the state is saying, ‚ÄòHey, we trust you to reinvest that money back into your business and the local economy.‚Äô And let me tell you, as someone who bootstrapped a company with just $4,000, every dollar counts.‚ÄùBut according to Meursing, it‚Äôs not just about the tax benefits. Texas has a diverse economy that‚Äôs not tied to any one single industry.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a well-balanced investment portfolio ‚Äî when one sector dips, another rises to keep things stable,‚Äù Meursing said, recalling a recent business trip to Austin. ‚ÄúThe energy there was palpable ‚Äî you could practically feel the entrepreneurial spirit in the air.‚ÄùMeursing is currently exploring expansion options within Texas, a big dream in a state known for everything being bigger.New YorkWhen it comes to business and the world of money, nowhere else is like New York ‚Äî especially New York City. The Empire State is the perfect example of a multi-opportunistic state to go from bust to boom. According to Meursing, the diversity of industries in New York is staggering.‚ÄúFrom Wall Street to Madison Avenue, from tech startups in Brooklyn to fashion houses in Manhattan ‚Äî it‚Äôs a smorgasbord of business opportunities. And let‚Äôs not forget the networking potential,‚Äù said Meursing. In New York, your next big client or game-changing connection could be riding next to you on the train, and you might not even know it.‚ÄúI cut my teeth in the event staffing world in New York City, and it was like getting a Ph.D. in hustle,‚Äù Meursing admitted, noting that the pace of business in New York is relentless. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs like trying to drink from a fire hose of opportunities. But if you can make it here, well, you know the rest.‚Äù‚ÄúNew York taught me valuable lessons about scaling a business,‚Äù remarked Meursing. ‚ÄúI remember staffing a high-end fashion event on 5th Avenue, juggling the demands of designers, celebrities and finicky clients. It was like playing 3D chess while riding a unicycle ‚Äî challenging, but exhilarating.‚Äú‚ÄòNew York,‚Äô I often say, ‚Äòis where you go to test your mettle. If you can build a successful business here, you can do it anywhere.'‚ÄùFloridaMeursing dubbed the Sunshine State as a place for reinvention and with it, the opportunity to make some big bucks.‚ÄúLast but not least on our tour is Florida ‚Äî a state that‚Äôs about more than just beaches and theme parks,‚Äù Meursing said. ‚ÄúFlorida is like that friend who‚Äôs always reinventing themselves ‚Äî always exciting, always full of surprises.‚ÄùBrenda Christensen, CEO of Stellar Public Relations, echoed this sentiment and said she left California for Florida, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ where the business climate is much more conducive to success ‚Äî lower taxes, expenses, no state tax and the list goes on and on.‚Äù‚ÄúI just saw a stat that Florida was in the top three states with new businesses. I believe it,‚Äù Christensen added. ‚ÄúIt very much reminds me of the tech startup culture in California of the 1990s. We‚Äôve realized a total savings of 20% per year just by relocating here. And we‚Äôve convinced other Cali tech friends to move, including another startup CEO and IBM VP.‚ÄùMeursing said the ‚Äú‚Ä¶ lack of state income tax is a big draw, much like in Texas.

A pair of residents say red tape from the province and regional district hasn't helped.Province says it's working to fix 'barriers' to rebuilding, urges homeowners to have insuranceLiam Britten  ¬∑ CBC News  ¬∑ Posted: Jul 04, 2024 9:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: 17 minutes agoThe Downton Lake wildfire near Gold Bridge B.C., burns toward the north shore of Gun Lake in this Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023 photo. Some property owners on Gun Lake say red tape is interfering with rebuilding work. (Owen Rose/The Canadian Press)Social SharingCharles Evans's cabin at Gun Lake was once an old mining office, according to what the Penticton man¬†was told.¬†It dated back to the 1950s, was dragged across the frozen lake during winter decades ago, and plopped onto the property he purchased in 2019 in B.C.'s Sea-to-Sky region.It and over 50 other properties were partially or completely burned by the Downton Lake wildfire in the summer of 2023.""We were like, well, OK, that's how it goes,"" Evans said of his family's mood after learning their cabin had been completely destroyed by the flames. ""We have insurance‚Ä¶ we'll figure it out. You know? It can't be that hard.""A photo of Charles Evans's cabin prior to the fire. Evans said he was months away from completing major work on the cabin. (Submitted by Charles Evans)As Evans found out, however,¬†it has been ""that hard,""¬†as he continues to face issues with rebuilding his beloved summer home.Those familiar with the aftermath of the Downton Lake wildfire say others have faced frustration as well, especially when rebuilding homes that are well out-of-date in terms of building codes.One homebuilder says it's becoming a familiar facet of B.C.'s recent destructive wildfire seasons.Evans blames confusing rules from the province and Squamish-Lillooet Regional District for making the process harder than it had to be.A photo of Charles Evans' cabin after it was destroyed by wildfire. (Submitted by Charles Evans)For instance, he claims, officials have been unclear about how close to the lakefront his new cabin could be.He said he waited eight months before being given permission to clear debris. He said he was told he'd need to hire an environmental consultant, paid $3,500 for that consultant, then was told the consultant wasn't necessary after all.""I don't like hearing myself saying, well, the rules should be special for us, but we're not trying to build a condo complex,"" Evans said.Evans explained his insurance is only covering a portion of the project. He estimates cleaning up and building an up-to-code cabin will cost about $450,000 to $550,000 out of pocket.¬†It might impact retirement plans for him and his wife, he said, but believes the alternative is having a burned-out plot of land with little future resale value.The Downton Lake wildfire was sparked by lightning on July 13, 2023. (B.C. Wildfire Service)Fire destroyed 56 propertiesThe Downton Lake fire sparked in July 2023 and burned through steep, wooded terrain at the western end of Gun Lake, northwest of Whistler, before flaring up and engulfing cabins. People in the area were ordered to evacuate.¬†The intense blaze even sparked a fire tornado.The chair of the regional¬†district, Jen Ford, said the fire destroyed 56 properties. Four belonged to full-time residents, and the rest were seasonal properties like Evans'.About half of the cabins lost at Gun Lake are decades old, according to full-time resident Debbie Demare.Demare is a former regional district director helping those who've lost structures. Her home is still standing, and she says some homes in the area have been handed down through generations.Footage of a 'fire tornado' was captured by firefighters near the area of Gun Lake, B.C. (B.C. Wildfire Service)Jason McLean has been camping in that area with his family since the 1980s. Around the turn of the 21st century, he and his brother bought a property there.McLean's family company, the McLean Group, owns several helicopter companies, including TyaX Adventures, which is based near Gun Lake, and Blackcomb Helicopters, which was contracted to help fight the fire that tore through the community.The Downton Lake fire led to evacuation orders for properties around Gun Lake. (Submitted by Dr. Renata Lewis)Two of his companies are donating $200,000 to help uninsured and underinsured properties deal with asbestos removal as part of any rebuild.""If you've got asbestos or other hazardous materials ‚Ä¶ it can be kind of a crushing, memory-ending, dream-ending scenario for a family,"" McLean said.He¬†added that many of the cabin owners he knows are seniors, grandchildren or ""cousin consortiums"" whose cabins have great sentimental value.'Costly measures'Regional district chair Jen Ford says she understands frustrations from property owners. District staff, she added, are trying to help and seek exemptions to some provincial requirements.One issue she has heard about is that cabins close to the lake's edge now need to be built further back.""Many of these properties were built a very long time ago ‚Ä¶ we know more [now] than we did about water impacts,"" Ford said.¬†'Incredibly rare' fire tornado captured on video by B.C. wildfire crewsMaegan Thomson, senior project adviser with Linwood Homes, says she has seen other property owners elsewhere in B.C. face sticker shock after their older home has burned down and they realize what modern regulations demand.""Many people had very simple structures, no insulation, no proper heat source, no cooling source,"" Thomson said. ""You now cannot build a new home without a cooling source. Those are costly measures.""The provincial Emergency Management Ministry says it's working to help people rebuild after the wildfire and has provided funds to the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District'Everyone just started running': evacuee describes rapid spread of B.C. wildfireThe ministry says it is identifying barriers to rebuilding and has provided updated guidance on cleaning up debris at lakefront areas.¬†""Having insurance can facilitate timely and efficient rebuilding,"" a spokesperson wrote.ABOUT THE AUTHORLiam BrittenDigital journalistLiam Britten is an award-winning journalist for CBC Vancouver.

Or is something in the works now?Netflix, which in 2019 bought a one-time license from Paramount with the option for a sequel, remains mum on the possibility.Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the first two movies and famously sat out the less-successful 1994 installment, says it‚Äôs partly a matter of how ‚ÄúAxel F‚Äù fares.‚ÄúAnother movie obviously is up to Netflix and frankly up to whether people turn this one on and watch,‚Äù says Bruckheimer, who anchored the 1984 original and its sequel with the late Don Simpson.Need a break?

So sure, it‚Äôs cops and robbers but it‚Äôs really about Axel reconciling with his daughter,‚Äù the star says. ‚ÄúOnce we added that to it, then, OK, that‚Äôs why Axel‚Äôs back in Beverly Hills and why he‚Äôs driving a truck through walls, to save his daughter and save his relationship with her.‚ÄùCould Broadway be next for Eddie Murphy?While Murphy could well be suiting up again for a fifth romp as Foley, he‚Äôs got another possible project in mind.

He won a state title in high school, went 27-1 as the starter at Michigan, and won a national title. However, the pundits are skeptical about McCarthy because he played in Jim Harbaugh‚Äôs run-first offense with the Wolverines. Either way, the Vikings drafted McCarthy 10th overall and will hand him the keys to the franchise at some point.But that goes back to the question of when. Former Minnesota GM Jeff Diamond, who works for the 33rd Team, predicted when every first-round QB taken in the 2024 NFL Draft would start. Diamond believes McCarthy will earn the starting job in Week 9 against the Indianapolis Colts.Minnesota plays the Rams on Thursday Night Football in Week 8, which would give McCarthy 10 full days to get ready for the Colts.

RJTtm2oT41MEpS6,Yahoo Finance,bing,"High-Performance Computing (HPC) Industry Report 2024 - Identifying the Leading Companies in Semiconductors, Equipment and Data Center Solutions",https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/high-performance-computing-hpc-industry-134000720.html,2024-07-04 09:56,2024-07-04 09:59,INTC,,"Company LogoDublin, July 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Thematic Intelligence: High-Performance Computing"" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.Supercomputers have existed since the 1960s, but there has been renewed interest in high-performing machines in the last decade following developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the exponential growth in data. Businesses, governments, and individuals generate huge volumes of data every day, and organizations use high-performance computing (HPC) to store, process, and analyze large, complex workloads to extract value from this data. In the last decade, the commercial use cases for HPC have expanded, supported by improvements in AI, cloud, and data analytics.Key HighlightsHistorically, HPC was the remit of academia. The COVID-19 pandemic helped put the spotlight back on HPC as a research resource. Cloud-based HPC has made the technology more accessible for applications like fraud detection and personalized medicine, eliminating the need for costly local data centers. Thanks to the cost-lowering benefits of customizable offerings tailored to specific use cases, alongside workload and performance improvements in HPC's underlying technology, HPC democratization has the potential to further broaden HPC's reach. Above all, greater flexibility has made HPC capabilities more accessible to a broader audience. While future quantum computing breakthroughs may revolutionize HPC, it remains the best technology for data processing today.AI's growing importance means governments with HPC systems capable of running complex AI systems will have a technological edge. Competition between the US and China for technological supremacy will intensify in the next decade. Regulatory scrutiny, international sanctions, and export controls will increase with the growing number and value of HPC applications, such as complex simulation in bioscience, financial risk management, and geological exploration and drilling. By enhancing cybersecurity, surveillance, and defense technologies, HPC's role in national security - among other sectors - will continue to stimulate the geopolitical tension that drives market volatility and disrupts supply chains.Story continuesReport ScopeThis report provides an overview of the high-performance computing (HPC) theme.It identifies the key trends impacting growth of the theme over the next 12 to 24 months, split into two categories: technology trends and macroeconomic trends.It includes comprehensive industry analysis, including data on HPC patent filings, M&A deals, and a timeline showing key events in the development of HPC.The detailed value chain shows comprises four segments: semiconductors, equipment, data center solutions, and end-users.ADVERTISEMENTIn the last decade, HPC's commercial use cases have grown, and the technology has become more accessible. This report is an invaluable guide to a theme that is increasing in importance, including identifying the leading companies in semiconductors, equipment, and data center solutions.Key Topics Covered:Executive SummaryPlayersTechnology BriefingTrendsIndustry AnalysisSignalsValue ChainCompaniesSector ScorecardCompany Coverage:AcctonAchronixAdtranAldecAlibabaAlpha DataAMAXAmazonAMDAmpere ComputingAmphenolAnsysAristaAtosAyar LabsBaiduBiren TechnologyBitmainBittWareBlaizeBrainChipBroadcomCambriconCaviumCentec NetworksCerebras SystemsCienaCiscoCloud Software GroupCloudFlareDellDialog SemiconductorsDust PhotonicsEQT InfrastructureEricssonEsperantoEta ComputeExtollExtreme NetworksF5FortinetFujian Jin HuaFujitsuGigabyte TechnologiesGoogleGrAI Matter LabsGraphcoreGroqGyrFalconHefei Chang Xin MemoryHorizon RoboticsHPEHua LiHuaweiI Squared CapitalIBMICFIllumioInfineonInnatera NanosystemsInspurIntelIonQJuniperKalrayLatticeLegrandLenovoMacronixMarvell TechnologyMediaTekMemVergeMercury SystemsMicrochipMicron TechnologyMicrosemiMicrosoftMythicNanyaNECNokiaNoviFlowNutanixNvidiaNXPOki ElectricOnsemiOpenTextOracleOxford IonicsOxford QuantumPalo Alto NetworksPenguin SolutionsPhytiumPluribusPowerchipProxmoxPsiQuantumPure StorageQCTQualcommQuantaQuickLogicRenesasRigettiS2CSAICSambaNovaSamsung ElectronicsScalitySeagateSiFiveSK HynixSocionextSTMicroelectronicsSugonSupermicroSynSenseTachyumTensTorrentTeslaTidalScaleToshibaTU DeftUnited MicroelectronicsUniversal QuantumVirtuozzoWestern DigitalWinbondYangtze River StorageZscalerZTEFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/qskpoiAbout ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

sIFefQ9VREOIKYQ,CNBC,google,"Microsoft's Surface Pro is fine, but it isn't the AI device to change personal computing",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/microsoft-surface-pro-11-review-app-compatibility-battery-life-shine.html,2024-07-04 10:00,2024-07-04 10:04,MSFT,,"The 11th edition of Microsoft's Surface Pro convertible tablet relies on a Qualcomm chip that sips power, resulting in over eight hours of battery life in early tests.App compatibility isn't perfect, but it's improving because of a new Prism emulator. When Microsoft announced its new line of Windows PCs in May, the company said the computers were ""designed for AI"" with new chips from Qualcomm that are more energy efficient than previous Intel processors.Among the first of the devices ‚Äî called Copilot+ PCs ‚Äî to hit the market is a Surface Pro convertible tablet. It can handle heftier computing tasks and boasts a longer battery life than laptops with Intel processors. It's a similar strategy to what Apple embarked on in 2020 when it started shipping custom energy-sipping Arm-based chips into its MacBooks, a move that has proved hugely successful.But what Microsoft has ultimately released with the Surface Pro amounts to a nice upgrade over its predecessor. To think it's ushering in a new era of AI computing is a bit farfetched. At least for now.The Surface line of computers doesn't drive a big business for Microsoft. The company reported $1.07 billion in device revenue, including from Surface PCs, in the first quarter, a small slice of its total $61.86 billion in revenue.I've been reviewing the Surface Pro for two weeks. Here's what you need to know about it. The Surface Pro hardware is high end. Microsoft sent me a review unit with Qualcomm's 12-core Snapdragon X Elite chip, a 512GB solid-state drive, 16GB of RAM and an OLED display. The device starts at $999, but this model costs $1,499.99. Performance is snappy for web browsing ‚Äî Google shipped an Arm version of Chrome for Windows in March ‚Äî and productivity software and a few video games, including ""Retrowave World"" and ""Poly Bridge 3,"" ran fine.The display is detailed and bright, with smooth scrolling thanks to a 120Hz refresh rate. The touchscreen is responsive. The iconic kickstand propping up the display is still solid. Under the kickstand, you'll find a compartment protecting the SSD, making hard drive replacements or upgrades easy.The Surface Pro delivered over eight hours of battery life in my early testing. Microsoft promises up to 10 hours of web browsing. The Surface Pro 9 with Microsoft's Arm-based SQ3 chip, released in 2022, was billed as having up to 19 hours of battery life, but reviewers found that app compatibility remained problematic. And unlike previous Arm-powered Surface PCs, such as the Surface Pro X from 2019, this model can run a wide assortment of applications, meaning buyers won't have to make a big compromise on compatibility.That's because Microsoft introduced a new emulator called Prism to help these new computers run programs designed for Intel and AMD chips. Almost daily, developers show off smart software relying on AI models for a range of purposes. Most of the time, the programs use servers in data centers to run difficult processing chores. But increasingly, developers are delegating some processing to users' phones and computers. A Copilot+ PC should be well suited for this emerging type of software, thanks to a neural processing unit, or NPU. The architecture leads to longer battery life because the rest of the chip can do other work.Microsoft includes some of its own artificial intelligence features in Windows 11 that draw on the NPU. If you join video calls, you can open the Settings app on the Surface Pro Copilot+ PC and turn on an option called Eye Contact. It will make you appear to be looking right at your webcam during calls, even when you're reading text. Apple has a similar simulated eye contact feature for FaceTime calls on the iPad.In Paint, you can enable a Cocreator mode to produce an image inspired by whatever you draw on the screen and using a description you type in. The computer's NPU spits out the image, but only after Microsoft sends your text prompt to the cloud to make sure you're not trying to craft something harmful or offensive.I found it fun to see how Cocreator would interpret my suggestions, but the results were not very impressive. I was better off pressing the Copilot key on the keyboard, which brings up a window for chatting with Microsoft's Copilot, and asking it to create images in a text chat. But you only have so many free image-generation credits with Copilot before it starts handling requests more slowly, whereas the Paint feature is consistently speedy.An AC adapter in the box magnetically latches on to Microsoft's proprietary Surface Connect port. It will be familiar to those who have bought Surface devices in the past decade. But you can also charge with one of the two USB-C ports, which is convenient.The Surface Pro can be hooked up to three monitors at 4K resolution, while the MacBook Air with an M3 chip can drive a single external display with up to 6K resolution at a 60Hz refresh rate.There's no headphone jack on the $999 tablet. Nor does it come with a keyboard, following tradition. After all, an iPad still doesn't come with a keyboard.A standard Surface Pro Keyboard that magnetically snaps onto the bottom of the Surface Pro sells for $139.99, and if you'd also like a model with Microsoft's Slim Pen stylus, you'll pay $279.99.Microsoft sent me its new Surface Pro Flex Keyboard with a Slim Pen included, a bundle that costs $449.98. It's more expensive than the regular attachable keyboard because it connects over Bluetooth. Microsoft promises 41 hours of continuous typing with the accessory. It charges while attached to the Surface Pro.For some users, it might be helpful to pull off the keyboard and use it while keeping the tablet a short distance away. I didn't find the accessory to be a big upgrade from the good old Surface Pro Keyboard. The biggest AI feature coming to this new Surface Pro and other Copilot+ PCs isn't available yet.When Microsoft announced Copilot+ PCs in May, executives spent ample time talking about Recall, which will let you type in a few words to search through your PC activity and see matching results. The company delayed the launch and said Recall would be off by default after security researchers found that hackers might be able to get to users' private data through screenshots the feature captures.Meanwhile, some applications, including Google Drive and ExpressVPN, still won't work on these new computers, at least for the moment. And as Windows on Arm gains early traction, there can be times when a traditional version of an app will be available in Microsoft's app store, but a native Arm version can be found on the developer's website. (That's the case with the media player VLC, for example.) But as a rule, software is less of an issue now for Surface PCs sporting long battery life.And Microsoft has reduced the powers of the Copilot to control your PC on this device, making it similar to just visiting the chatbot on the web. When the company brought Copilot to Windows 11 last fall, the assistant could open programs, switch to dark mode and disable Bluetooth. The 11th edition of the Surface Pro is worth considering, so long as you can be assured that the apps that you need will work on an Arm-based machine. That's more likely to be true than it was five years ago.The battery life is good, I like that it's easy to upgrade and swap out storage and the screen is excellent. It's a solid upgrade over earlier models. Microsoft made the right decision to move to Arm-based processors. But, the company has been billing this as an ""AI PC,"" but, for now, the biggest AI features aren't here yet.

C4AizLReVhQ6fAs,Seeking Alpha,google,AbbVie Q2 Preview: Upgrade To Buy - Better Late Than Never (NYSE:ABBV),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702460-abbvie-upgraded-to-a-buy-better-late-than-never,2024-07-04 09:58,2024-07-04 10:05,ABBV,,"cacaroot/iStock via Getty Images ABBV's Investment Thesis Remains Robust - We Had Been Too Bearish After All We previously covered AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in April 2024, discussing how it had outperformed our originally more bearish expectations, with Humira remaining the market leader despite the Loss Of Exclusivity [LOE] and biosimilar headwinds. Combined with its pipeline's recent US FDA approval, the market continued to award the stock with stable FWD P/E valuations, further aided by robust shareholder returns. Despite so, we had maintained our Hold rating then, with there likely to be moderate headwinds to Humira's sales in 2024 as a directly interchangeable biosimilar had been approved by the US FDA. Since then, the stock has mostly traded sideways with a +5.1% total return compared to the wider market at +6%. It is apparent over the past few Hold ratings that ABBV has proven itself to be an outperformer in both financial and stock performances, no matter the uncertain LOE issues and macroeconomic conditions. We will also be highlighting a few metrics to look out for in the upcoming FQ2'24 earnings call on July 25, 2024, underscoring the health of ABBV's businesses along with near-term prospects. 1. We Had Been Too Bearish On Humira's LOE We have been previously concerned about the impact of biosimilars on Humira, and it is apparent that those fears are being overly done. This is why. For context, ABBV's patent protection for Humira had expired by the beginning of 2023, with the pharmaceutical company facing impacted Humira sales of $2.27B in FQ1'24 (-31.2% QoQ/ -35.8% YoY/ -59.2% from peak quarterly sales of $5.57B in FQ4'22). Even so, Humira continues to command the leading market share of over 80% in the US by early June 2024 despite ""facing nine lower-priced rivals in the last year."" These developments underscore why ABBV's higher rebates and lower Humira pricing have paid off extremely well in retaining market share despite the notable impact on its top/bottom lines. Weekly Prescriptions For Humira Since July 2023 Reuters While CVS Health Corporation (CVS) has removed Humira from its list of covered drugs, it seems that the worst may already be over, with the therapy's weekly prescriptions continuing to grow after the sharp drop in April 2024. With multiple levers to pull, we believe that ABBV continues to command the leading mindshare in the US market and is likely to remain so in the intermediate future, as similarly commented by the management in the FQ1'24 earnings call: We continue to anticipate that Humira will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. (Seeking Alpha) This is especially true since Alvotech's (ALVO) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited's (TEVA) directly interchangeable biosimilar option for Humira, Simlandi, is only slated to enter the US market from February 2025 onwards. The delayed entry may temporarily moderate Humira's erosion since the region comprises 78% of the therapy's global sales in FQ1'24 (-5 points YoY). Perhaps this development has contributed to ABBV's relatively promising FY2024 guidance, with the US Humira erosion at ""approximately -32%"" mostly attributed to price rebates and, to a smaller extent, CVS's formulary change. 2. FQ2'24 Performance & FY2024 Guidance For context, ABBV has already raised their FY2024 adj EPS guidance to $11.23 at the midpoint (+1% YoY), up from the guidance of $11.15 (+0.3% YoY) offered in the FQ4'23 earnings call and the original $10.85 (-2.3% YoY) offered in the FQ3'23 earnings call. This is despite the multiple adjustments related to the acquired IPR&D and milestones expenses, including $0.42 from the ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics Acquisitions to be completed in H1'24. While there may be further impacts from the recently completed Celsius Therapeutics deal worth $250M, we are not overly concerned for now,. This is because ABBV continues to report robust ex-Humira portfolio growth at +15% YoY in FQ1'24 while guiding robust FQ2'24 revenues of $14B (+0.9% YoY) and adj EPS of $3.07 (+5.4% YoY) at the midpoint, thanks to the easier YoY comparison. This development further underscores the pharmaceutical company's robust pipelines and M&A efforts while allowing it to overlap Humira's painful LOE and top/ bottom-line erosion. These factors also demonstrate why ABBV's stock performance has outperformed Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb Company's (BMY) thus far, despite their similar LOE issues thus far. As a result, we believe that the upcoming earnings call may potentially be another beat and raise, as how it has been over the past four consecutive quarters (barring the -$0.01 adj EPS miss in FQ4'23). 3. Balance Sheet Health & Dividend Hike It goes without saying that ABBV has been one of the most aggressive pharmaceutical companies in M&A activities thus far, with five acquisitions announced over the past twelve months (on top of multiple partnerships). This has contributed to its growing long-term debts on balance sheet at $63.8B (+7.6% QoQ/ +7.6% YoY/ -4.3% from FY2019 levels of $66.72B) and deteriorating net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.53x in FQ1'24 (compared to 1.78x in FQ4'23, 2.40x in FQ1'23, and 1.77x in FY2019). With this number being higher than the average 2.36x reported by the General Drug Manufacturers, readers may want to monitor ABBV's execution and balance sheet health over the next few quarters since borrowing costs remain elevated with the Fed yet to pivot. While the pharmaceutical company remains profitable, the elevated debt load and consequently higher interest expenses may eventually cut into its ability to sustain the historical 5Y dividend growth rate of +8.34% and 10Y rate of +14.1%, with the last hike of +4.7% being somewhat underwhelming.  So, Is ABBV Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold?  ABBV 5Y Stock Price TradingView For now, ABBV has traded sideways since early 2024, with the stock currently consolidating at $170s as we enter the Q2'24 earnings season. For context, we had offered a fair value estimate of $167.40 in our last article, based on the FY2023 adj EPS of $11.11 (after including the 2023 acquired IPR&D/milestones expenses) and the FWD P/E valuations of 15.07x. Based on the ABBV management's recently raised FY2024 adj EPS guidance to $11.23 and the same FWD P/E mean of 15.07x (near to its 1Y mean of 15.05x), it is apparent that the stock continues to trade near our upgraded fair value estimates of $169.20. The same may be observed in our reiterated long-term price target of $201, attributed to the stable consensus FY2026 adj EPS estimates of $13.37 (compared to $13.34 in our previous article). At the same time, ABBV remains a dividend aristocrat, with the robust forward dividend yield of 3.61% still richer than the sector median of 1.43%, and long-term shareholders likely looking forward to the next dividend raise in the FQ3'24 earnings call in October 2024, continuing the trend of ten consecutive years in payout growth. Combined with its robust ex-Humira portfolio performance and the management's consistently raised FY2024 guidance, we believe that it is finally time to upgrade our rating for the ABBV stock to a Buy indeed. Author's Rating Seeking Alpha It goes without saying, that our Buy rating has come relatively late, with us missing out on the +19.3% return since July 2023, compared to the wider market at +20.3%. However, we believe that it is better to be late than never, especially since ABBV has proven itself to be an outperformer in both financial and stock performance, no matter the uncertain LOE issues and macroeconomic conditions.  At the same time, this Buy rating does not come with a specific entry point since it depends on individual investors' dollar cost averages and portfolio allocation.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
htFCfzCdSd0p0kk,Inside EVs,google,So You Just Got Trapped In Your EV With Electronic Door Latches. What To Do,https://insideevs.com/features/725298/trapped-inside-ev-electronic-latches/,2024-07-04 10:00,2024-07-04 10:07,TSLA,,"If you get locked on the outside of an EV with a dead low-voltage battery and door latches that need power to work, getting in is inconvenient, but follow a few steps that apply to most cars and you‚Äôll regain access in no time. When the vehicle's 12-volt battery dies while you're inside, the situation becomes more challenging, and it could potentially leave you feeling trapped. However, you shouldn‚Äôt panic. Manufacturers have realized this can turn into a serious safety issue and have fitted their vehicles with backup mechanical handles to allow you to open the doors from the inside with no power. It pays to not only look into this for your specific vehicle but also take the time to test it out‚Äîin some cars, it's very easy and obvious how to open the doors, while in others it's a bit tricker. There's Always A Mechanical Door Release      There was an incident in 2021 when a Tesla Model Y lost power and caught fire while on the move, trapping its driver inside as it was going up in flames. The driver said the windows didn‚Äôt work, nor did the buttons to get the doors to pop open. He resorted to kicking out the driver‚Äôs side window so that he could climb outside, not knowing all Teslas have backup mechanical door handles for the front doors, which you can pull to open the doors even when the car has malfunctioned or has no power. Other reports describe situations where occupants in EVs with e-latches, particularly those in Teslas, became trapped inside their vehicles after they lost power, but they weren't in immediate danger and eventually found their way out. All Teslas have easily accessible mechanical handles that you can pull to open the front doors. They are located in front of the window switch panel, and they are easy to spot and operate. If you‚Äôre in the back of a Tesla, the mechanical door release mechanisms are strangely tricky to locate. In the Model S, you find it by looking for cutouts in the carpeting under the seat, and moving the cutout part out of the way will reveal tabs that you can pull to open the doors.      To manually unlatch the door in the Model X, you actually have to remove the speaker grilles and find a cable to pull down and toward the front of the vehicle. You will then have to manually lift the big falcon wing doors before out of the way finally being able to get out of the car. For the Model 3 and Model Y, the solution is similar. You will have to reach down to the bottom of the rear door pockets (remove the rubber mat that‚Äôs there in the Model Y) and open a plastic cover before gaining access to the cable release for the door. If you don‚Äôt know where these mechanical release mechanisms are located, it can be bad news if you want to escape the vehicle quickly after an accident. You will feel like you‚Äôre trapped inside, and you may panic, but it‚Äôs worth noting that all vehicles with electric door latches have a mechanical override.      If you drive a vehicle with electric latches and you don‚Äôt know where the mechanical door release is, you should consult the manual or ask your dealer so that, in an emergency, you will be able to not only let yourself out of the vehicle but also inform passengers of how they can escape. In a Ford Mustang Mach-E, you can find the mechanical release in the armrest part of the door panel. You pull on the handle and open the door manually, but this does not work for the rear doors. If you want to get out of a Lucid with no power, the manufacturer says you should pull on the door handle harder than normal and that this will unlatch the door mechanically. The good thing is that you can check the manual while you‚Äôre in the vehicle to find the location of its mechanical releases. If you‚Äôre in a car with an electric latch for the glove box, you may have to pry it open if it‚Äôs an emergency, or you can simply access the manual via your vehicle‚Äôs mobile app, which should also make searching for the information easier. Charging Your EV's 12-Volt To Regain Access      While it‚Äôs not as big a problem as getting out, gaining access to the inside of a vehicle that has powered latches and no power can still be a challenge.¬†It can even potentially become dangerous like when firefighters were called to rescue a little girl from a Tesla¬†Model Y whose low-voltage battery went flat. The exterior door handles were no longer working and the toddler couldn‚Äôt open any of the doors essentially trapping her inside. Some cars don‚Äôt have a way to mechanically open the doors, like early Cadillac Lyriqs with the initial door handle design or Teslas. In some newer BMWs with flush exterior door handles, you reach under the handle to hit a button to open the door, but you can also pull the handle out to open the door manually. This is the same for the front doors on Volkswagen‚Äôs ID electric vehicles. Other BMWs, like the iX, have a different style of flush door handle, and you will need to remove the flap that hides the keyhole on the driver‚Äôs door and then pull on that flap until you hear a click.      In a Tesla, though, there is no way to do that and you will have to first charge the 12-volt battery, which powers most of the car‚Äôs auxiliary systems, including the door latches. Accessing a Tesla‚Äôs 12-volt battery in newer Teslas is easier than in old models. In a 2012 to 2016 Model S, for instance, you will have to pop off the gloss black nose cone to gain access to the battery terminals. You don‚Äôt have to get to the actual battery, which is located behind one of the frunk panels, and charging via the remote terminals saves time. In some early Model S sedans, Tesla installed a mechanical release lever underneath the glovebox. Pulling this will partly release the hood, which will allow you to stick your hand underneath the leading edge of the hood to find the secondary release, which will allow you to fully open it and reach the battery. If you have a post-2016 Model S, you will need to pry away the wheel fairings in front of the two front wheels to gain access to the pull tabs that open the two hood latches. Once you‚Äôve popped it open, you can charge the low-voltage battery by removing the plastic maintenance panel located between the frunk and the windscreen and hooking up a charger to its terminals.      Charging the 12-volt battery in the Tesla¬†Model 3 and Model Y is easier. You can pop the round cover off the towing ring in the front bumper. This will reveal two wires and terminals, one black and one red, which are the negative and positive terminals. This allows you to quickly juice up the 12-volt battery and gain access to your car. The Ford Mustang Mach-E has this same solution. The process of locating the terminals for the low-voltage battery and hooking them up to a charger will be very similar in all other EVs. If they are made by a legacy OEM like Hyundai-Kia, General Motors or the Volkswagen group, you should also have a physical key that you will be able to open at least the driver‚Äôs door with to gain access to the vehicle, which would then allow you to open the hood and start charging the dead 12-volt battery.

hkwalLqlnROldh7,Seeking Alpha,bing,Blue Bird: No Longer A Hidden EV Gem But There's More Upside,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702459-blue-bird-no-longer-a-hidden-ev-gem-but-theres-more-upside,2024-07-04 10:22,2024-07-04 10:25,TSLA,,"ablokhin Blue Bird Corporation (NASDAQ:BLBD), one of the leading school bus manufacturers in the United States, caught my attention almost a year ago as the company, in my opinion, was well-positioned back then to benefit from the growing demand for EV school buses. My investment thesis for the company was centered around a few key observations.  I thought Blue Bird's turnaround strategy would expand profit margins while helping the company make the most of the growing demand for EV buses. I believed The EPA Clean School Bus Rebate Program would have a positive impact on both the short and long-term demand for Blue Bird's EVs. I thought Blue Bird would benefit from a favorable product mix in the future with the company planning to increase the prices of new buses by $2,500. Blue Bird was positioned to benefit from favorable industry trends with regulators promoting the use of alternative energy school buses.   In the past 12 months, most of these factors have played exactly as I thought they would. Blue Bird's financial performance has improved meaningfully during this period. From a loss of $11 million in Q1 2023, Blue Bird has come a long way to report a profit of $26 million in Q2 2024. Exhibit 1: Blue Bird quarterly net income   FinChat Mr. Market has not been oblivion to Blue Bird's turnaround story. Since my first article, published in July 2023, BLBD stock is up 113%. I revisited my thesis last December to find Blue Bird executing well, and in today's update, I will assess the current valuation of the company and the broad market opportunity to determine whether BLBD is still an attractive bet. Favorable Policies Will Be A Growth Catalyst When I developed an interest in Blue Bird a year ago, I had to dive deep into the economics of the school bus market to understand what is keeping school districts from transitioning to electric buses despite the benefits they offer. EVs offer several clear advantages over diesel buses, such as lower maintenance costs and savings on fuel. According to Blue Bird, its EVs can reduce operating costs from around 50 cents per mile to 14 cents per mile as electricity is often cheaper than fossil fuel. A study conducted by the Federal Transit Administration found in 2019 that transitioning from diesel buses to electric buses will save approximately 44% in maintenance costs per mile. In addition to these benefits, increased adoption of electric buses will help the government's emission goals. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, replacing a diesel school bus with an electric bus will save 54,000 pounds of CO2 annually. None of these perceived wins, however, was sufficient to lure school districts to replace diesel buses because of the substantial initial capital outlay required to purchase electric buses. As of last April, the average contracted price for an EV bus was $352,000 while diesel buses were selling for an average of less than $100,000. This massive disparity between EV and diesel buses has been the primary reason behind the slow adoption of EV buses. Exhibit 2: Average purchase price of electric school buses for recipients in the Clean School Bus Program   Resources.org This is where things get interesting. In the last couple of years, the Federal government and several state governments have launched programs to accelerate the adoption of electric buses by offering financial support to school districts. These supportive regulatory decisions pave the way for school districts to keep their upfront costs limited while benefiting from the low operating costs of electric buses. Some of the notable policy developments include:  The EPA Clean School Bus Program which provides $5 billion in funding to purchase electric buses. DOE loans and grants. California√¢¬Ä¬ôs Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project which offers funding between $140,250 and $375,000 per bus. New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program which offers up to $120,000 per electric school bus. Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Incentive Program which offers up to $75,000 per electric bus.  With state governments showing an increased desire to support the adoption of electric school buses, I expect the top EV bus makers to see a continued expansion in the backlog. This market is concentrated among a few players such as Blue Bird, Thomas Built Buses, and IC Bus, which suggests Blue Bird is well-positioned to benefit from macro tailwinds. The Addressable Market Opportunity Is Massive The adoption of electric buses has accelerated in recent years. As of December 2023, there were 3,769 electric school buses on U.S. roads, up from just 767 in June 2022. The total number of committed electric school buses stood at 12,164 as of Q2 2024 compared to just 3,291 two years ago. According to the World Resources Institute, California leads the way with approximately 2,300 committed electric buses. Exhibit 3: Total number of committed electric school buses   World Resources Institute According to the New York School Bus Contractors Association, there are approximately 480,000 school buses in the U.S. today, transporting 26 million students annually. Despite the recent uptick in electric bus commitments, more than 90% of these buses run on diesel. This low penetration of electric buses will pave the way for stellar EV growth in the next decade. Blue Bird, since 2018, has progressed toward offering alternative energy buses and its exposure to diesel buses has declined sharply since then. This gives me confidence that Blue Bird's business strategy is perfectly aligned with today's market requirements. Exhibit 4: Blue Bird's unit sales by year   Investor presentation As discussed in the next segment, Blue Bird continues to focus on growing its EV division. Investing To Grow One of the key risks of investing in turnaround stories is that these companies may repeat their original mistakes in the future. Blue Bird has successfully come out of a tough phase to see light - and profits - at the end of the tunnel. Even more encouragingly, the company is focused on keeping its foot on the pedal to ensure it captures new opportunities to grow. During the recent earnings call in May, the management highlighted their plans to double CapEx to increase manufacturing capacity. The company is targeting to manufacture 50 new buses per day to meet the growing demand for electric school buses. In addition to expanding manufacturing capacity, Blue Bird is also focused on improving the safety features of these buses, investing in supply chain capabilities, and upgrading production facilities. The Valuation Is Reasonable Blue Bird is currently valued at a forward P/E of 17.5 and a P/S multiple of just over 1. With electric bus sales expected to account for the bulk of revenue in the long term, valuation multiples are likely to mirror that of leading EV makers in the world. For context, Tesla is valued at a forward P/E of 91 today. It will take time - probably a couple of years - for this transition to take place. BLBD stock's strong performance this year amid the disappointing performance of U.S. EV market leader Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is an indication that the market is beginning to see value in Blue Bird's profitable EV expansion. Blue Bird President Britton Smith, in an interview with Newsweek last week, made some bold remarks including the suggestion that other EV makers should take a leaf out of its book. Blue Bird shows that as an EV company, you can still make money, and Blue Bird is doing that with every bus that we sell. As bold as that statement is, it is true. Blue Bird's electric buses have boosted the company's profitability, which is a good enough reason to suggest that earnings multiples will expand in the future. I am not suggesting Blue Bird should trade at similar earnings multiples as Tesla, but today, the company seems cheaply valued given its growing exposure to EVs. Takeaway  Blue Bird has delivered the promised goods in the last 12 months. In the next 12 months, the company will continue to benefit from favorable macroeconomic developments. Earnings revisions are likely to maintain an upward trajectory in the coming months with the company boosting its guidance for the current Fiscal year. This should create strong momentum in the market, lifting BLBD stock higher. I am planning to remain invested in BLBD for the long run and I believe investors are not too late to jump on board yet.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Jeff Stapleton/CBC)Social SharingIt would cost more than $3 million a year to pay all City of Winnipeg employees and contractors' workers a living wage of $19.21 per hour, a new report estimates.The report by city staff, done after councillors Matt Allard and Cindy Gilroy proposed Winnipeg work toward paying all employees a living wage, is on the agenda for the July 9 executive policy committee meeting.An estimated 516 city employees make less than $19.21 an hour, the report says. The $3 million total also includes a ""very rough estimate"" of the cost to the city if contractors' workers, such as cleaning staff and security guards, also got the increase.The higher wages would provide a ""big boost"" for the 311 customer service staff, librarians, wading pool attendants, garbage collectors and others who make low wages, said Gilroy, the councillor for Daniel McIntyre.¬†""We know that there has been struggles with people being able to afford rent and food, and that's just for city employees,"" Gilroy told CBC on Wednesday.""So I think being a fair living wage city sets the bar and really shows that we are a caring city.""Coun. Cindy Gilroy says introducing a living wage for City of Winnipeg employees shows workers that the city cares.  (Travis Golby/CBC)Gilroy thinks the city can afford the cost, especially if it starts with just increasing pay for city staff (not contractors' workers). The report estimates bringing only city workers' wages up to $19.21 an hour would cost around $1.75 million.Mayor Scott Gillingham said the report reinforces that wages should be negotiated through collective bargaining.¬†""When you factor in the benefits that city employees receive, like ambulance, hospital, vision, dental, paid sick leave, there is a value to all of those benefits that was not contemplated in the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives framework,"" Gillingham said.The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives says $19.21 is the minimum wage a family of four, with two young children and both parents working 35 hours per week, must earn to achieve a decent standard of living.It doesn't include costs for debt repayment or retirement savings (beyond the Canada Pension Plan).The city report says because the living wage of $19.21/hour includes costs such as private health insurance and illness, city benefits can replace some of the costs.Winnipeg Mayor Scott Gillingham says wages should be negotiated through collective bargaining.  (Warren Kay/CBC)The report estimates the value of those benefits at a little more than $2/hour, which would bring the required living wage down to $17.03; the cost of implementing that wage for city employees (not including contractors' workers) is estimated at just under $500,000.CUPE, which represents most of the affected workers, estimates that once benefits are factored in, the living wage would be $17.87 an hour.Winnipeg mayor opposes living wage motion, says collective bargaining should set payThe cost of implementing that living wage for city employees would be ""extremely"" minimal, CUPE Local 500 president Gord Delbridge said.""The City of Winnipeg is one of the largest employers in Manitoba.

This week it closed its second fund, Forestay Capital II, at a hard cap of $220 million. The VC wasn‚Äôt well known in Europe until it started to lead rounds in enterprise startups a couple of years ago, notably scanning software startup Scandit ‚Äî which has raised $273M to date ‚Äî out of Zurich.¬†The Forestay II fund will invest across Europe and Israel, with a ‚Äòsweet spot‚Äô of leading growth rounds of $10M-$15M, at the inflexion point of a company, it said.¬†To date the VC has backed 13 companies, including K2View, Nexthink, Scandit and Wasabi, of which three reached unicorn status and two were acquired. Most recently, the firm backed Neural Concept, a company spun out from EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, which raised $27M in a Series B round to tackle fast manufacturing design with AI.¬†Forestay also led the A round for Portugal‚Äôs ‚Äòpredictive maintenance‚Äô startup Stratio, with a $12M Series A back in 2021.The Forestay fund was founded as a fund of B-FLEXION, the private investment vehicle created by the Bertarelli family which is best known for building Serono into the third-largest biotech business globally, before its merger with Merck KGaA.¬†Forestay is led by Frederic Wohlwend, the former Global Chief Digital Officer of Merck KGaA and Serono.‚ÄúAs Chief Digital Officer in large corporations, mainly the biopharma clinical space, I had the chance to look at the entire value chain, from early research down to distribution, in fairly sizable enterprises,‚Äù he told TechCrunch over a call. ‚ÄúSo by knowing the enterprise inside out, that‚Äôs why we decided to focus on on enterprise and enterprise AI.‚ÄùWhile ‚Äúit‚Äôs a highly competitive market‚Äù, Wohlwend said the fund will be ‚Äúextremely focused in the way we do venture, adding: ‚ÄúWe only do enterprise AI and SaaS.

If you're also curious about which other wines will cost you an arm and a leg, here is our full list of the¬†20 Most Expensive Wines in the World.Global Wine Market:Wine is one of the Most Consumed Alcohols in the World. As we mentioned in our article ‚Äì 15 Best Wine Producing Regions in the World ‚Äì the global wine market size was valued at $441.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a value of $698.54 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 5.9% over the forecast period.Wine is gaining huge popularity among millennials and youngsters, owing to its refreshing appeal and low ABV offerings. The rising demand for premium and luxury wines, increasing consumer awareness about the health benefits of wine, and the growing popularity of wine tourism are some of the key factors driving the growth of the wine market.The United States was the world leader in the wine market in 2022 in terms of revenue, with $52.7 billion. Here are the U.S. States that Drink the Most Wine.Wine As a Lucrative Investment Asset:¬†Rare wines are incredible as investment vehicles. This beloved tipple can preserve and even increase in value during economic instabilities, inflationary periods, and recessions. RareWine Invest is Scandinavia‚Äôs largest provider of investment wine, with the Danish company administering and storing wine worth over $215 million on behalf of thousands of investors globally. In an interview with Forbes last year, Lars Granat Jensen, the CMO of RareWine Invest stated the following:‚ÄúThe performance of wine under management at RareWine Invest in 2022 was 22.5%, and our annualized performance for the past five years was 12.88% per year. Last year 1,115 positions under management at RareWine Invest were realized and the average return was 88%.‚ÄùSustainability in the Wine Industry:¬†When we talk about sustainable winemaking, it is usually about the entire process and not just the additives at the end. There has been a concerted effort across the entire wine industry to transition towards biodiversity and organic farming. This means no pesticides, herbicides, or synthetic fertilizers, and an all-around effort to promote a variety of plant life in the vineyard. In short ‚Äì growing grapes in a way that is harmonious with nature. This is an approach that a massive amount of wine producers have now embraced.Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is a leading premium wine company with a widely admired portfolio that includes Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, Clos du Bois, Blackstone, Estancia, Ravenswood, and more. It was announced last year that the company‚Äôs renowned To Kalon Vineyard has achieved organic certification through California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF), the first organic certifying agency in the U.S. Located in Napa‚Äôs Oakville appellation, To Kalon Vineyard has been farmed organically for the past four years and meets rigorous standards around the use of renewable resources and conservation of soil and water. This achievement accelerates STZ‚Äôs deep commitment to its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategy while improving the health and sustainability of the land for future generations.Story continuesThe New York-based company made headlines last summer when its Mexican beer brand, Modelo Especial, became the Top-Selling Beer in America after dethroning Bud Light. As a result, STZ reported a revenue of over $2.12 billion during its last quarter of the fiscal year 2024, a significant increase of 22.7% compared to the previous year. Net income also went up by 11.7% to reach $105 million.The U.S. beer industry saw a tough start to the year, given the poor weather conditions in the states. However, STZ‚Äôs beer segment, which brought in 82% of its sales in FY 2024, still reported growth of 10.9% during the last quarter. The volume demand continues to grow and the company management stating that Q1 2025 is ‚Äòsetting us off on a really solid year‚Äô suggests that they are seeing no major signs of slowdown. And while STZ‚Äôs Wine & Spirits segment witnessed a 5.6% decline in Q4, its smaller size minimizes the downside risk. For fiscal year 2024, Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) generated $2.8 billion in operating cash flow and was able to reduce its net leverage ratio by nearly half a point while returning over $900 million back to its shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. And although its forward dividend yield doesn‚Äôt seem high at 1.51%, the company has both paid and grown its dividends for the last eight years.Another factor helping STZ is that America‚Äôs Hispanic population is growing almost twice as fast as its general population, so brands like Modelo and Corona are expected to stay in high demand. Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) continues to be one of the Best Alcohol Stocks to Buy Now, with 47 hedge fund holders in Q1 2024 boasting an overall stake value of over $2.74 billion.With that said, here are the Top Wines in the World by Price.The Most Expensive Wine in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainMethodology:¬†To collect data for this article, we referred to sources such as Forbes, Sotheby‚Äôs, Sommelier Business etc., looking for the Most Expensive Bottles of Wine.

The vintage was acquired by the New York developer and wine collector Rob Rosania during an auction held by Sotheby's in 2018. ¬†Though the well-reputed winery is a renowned producer to this day, this particular expression is especially coveted because only 600 bottles were reportedly produced due to the shortage of resources in 1945, and the vines were removed and replanted after this vintage.Considered the pinnacle of Burgundy, DRC is one of the Most Expensive Wine Brands in the current market and produces around 6,000 cases of wine per year from its tiny vineyards in Vosne-Roman√©e.

The tremendous advancement in AI technologies is impressive, and long-term structural tailwinds exist. We believe AI has the power to be truly transformational, and like past innovations, we anticipate a long, winding road. The large premiums placed on a handful of companies suggest investors believe the value of AI technologies may be limited to a select few. Concentration in these perceived winners has the S&P 500 (SP500, SPX) selling at a price-to-earnings ratio ('PE') of 26.0x trailing earnings at quarter end. Chasing this latest trend is expensive, and once a stock market trend gains enough traction to have a catchy name, its golden era may already be over. A recent Wall Street Journal analysis of the eight named trends over the last decade indicated that the named group of stocks saw performance peak 12 months after being given a moniker.[1] As we write, the ""Magnificent Seven""[2] is celebrating its 11th month birthday. They represent 18% of the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI). This dominance has caused the U.S. equity markets to represent a staggering 60% of the MSCI ACWI Index-an influence that we have not seen in more than two decades. Not surprisingly, this environment reminds us of the late 1990s when the market chased productivity and tech stocks. The sectoral performance patterns, narrow market leadership and high valuations we see today resemble the explosive, pre-bubble rally from late 1998 to early 2000. By contrast to the late 1990s, these market-leading companies are more profitable. At the same time, the overall stock market has a lower assumed volatility, suggesting high confidence. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Market Volatility Index, or VIX, which has become synonymous with market sentiment and an anchor for risk management, is hovering at record lows-almost half the level of the late 1990s. More recently, it has fallen -30% from one year ago and -80% from March 2020. This signals a bull market to some, while serving as a potential warning sign of trouble ahead for others. Against this backdrop, Ariel International Fund returned +5.55%, shy of the MSCI EAFE Index's +5.78% rise. Meanwhile, Ariel Global Fund advanced +7.35%, which was 85 basis points under the MSCI ACWI Index's +8.20% in the first quarter. Although we fell short of our respective benchmarks in an up market, we are pleased to see our overall portfolios capture more of the market's rise than in past rallies by 1) bringing down cash levels; 2) reducing ""tail"" positions; 3) lessening portfolio concentration in the largest three positions; and 4) further increasing our focus on stocks with both attractive valuations and solid business momentum. We have intentionally sought to capture more upside while minding downside protection. Our recent upside participation was driven by strong performance from some of our largest positions that do not succumb to ""trendiness."" Still, we have maintained the strategy's defensive tilt that is poised to withstand economic deceleration and provide downside protection. Investor FOMO A powerful technology shift is underway, driven by AI, and long-term success depends on the ability to scale and generate revenue from new AI-powered products and services. For example, some large-scale AI applications require 100x more processing power than current models which will force companies to make sizeable investments. As winners and losers emerge, we like the prospects for semiconductor companies and cybersecurity. Semiconductors are foundational to the immense computation resources that drive AI's complex algorithms. Last quarter, we discussed three semiconductor holdings: Intel Corporation (INTC), Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd (OTCPK:SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) While Intel fell -11.9% for the first three months of the year, the business fundamentals remain compelling for long-term investors. Meanwhile, Samsung was up +0.7%, but is lagging in high-speed memory in these early rounds. It is working hard to catch up and has the potential to tap into this fast-rising segment soon. Lastly, global semiconductor leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. surged +26.4% during the first quarter. Also supercharged by FOMO, the Nikkei 225 Index (NKY:IND) representing the biggest Japanese companies, reached an all-time high this quarter after being in a holding pattern for 34 years. Japan's economic success and stock market rebound are largely attributed to 25 years of reform efforts in Tokyo. While the sharp rise has meant fewer attractively-valued opportunities in Japan, we benefitted from owning automobile and aerospace manufacturer, Subaru Corporation (OTCPK:FUJHY), which soared +25.7% following a solid earnings report and future potential in the electric vehicle category. With Japan amped up by FOMO hype, investors may want to look at South Korea, as Seoul seeks to replicate Tokyo's success through corporate tax incentives, prioritizing shareholder returns and a new ""Korea Value-Up Index""[3] for those with improved governance. These programs should benefit banks like KB Financial Group (KB), which is one of the largest bank-centric financial groups in Korea. The stock was a strong contributor in Ariel Global Fund this quarter-gaining +25.3% following strong capital returns to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in addition to the company's robust and stable diversified profit structure. When it comes to avoiding FOMO, one study suggests ""√¢¬Ä¬¶a shift in attentional control: Focus less on the potential losses of missing out and focus more on immediate gains for what's being done in the now.""[4] The Chinese stock market looks like the opposite of FOMO these days and may represent future gains that will come from ""what's being done in the now."" We remain bullish on Mainland China stocks trading at low valuations, which stand to benefit from a gradual economic recovery. Although China's dominant search engine, Baidu, Inc. (BIDU), fell -11.7% during the quarter, we continue to have strong conviction in the name. The company has a stable revenue model from its search ad business as well as growth opportunities based on noncore investments in AI cloud. Looking Ahead The overall AI narrative is one of inevitability with many anticipating a productivity tipping point. While broad optimism continues to prevail, there is a cautious undertone. Equities now carry premium valuations with volatility near historical lows during a time when geopolitical and political uncertainties remain high. As many know, hope is not a plan. And so, we are evaluating the potential drivers of economic and market fluctuations and preparing for possible scenarios:  The AI bloom comes off the rose. Wars and worldwide challenges/uncertainties spark a sharp sell-off. Economic slowdown with prolonged rising inflation  The AI and AI-enabled companies in our portfolios have benefitted from booming growth but have not kept pace with valuations. Accordingly, we believe they have room to run. At the same time, our holdings do not carry the same risks as today's celebrity stocks. Our attention to risk management and emphasis on companies with proven histories of stable revenues and earnings growth in varying economic environments will become increasingly important during any slowdown. We believe our lower risk exposures will insulate our portfolios on the downside.

Sincerely, Henry Mallari-D'Auria, CFA,√Ç¬ÆChief Investment Officer, Global and Emerging Markets Equities   Investments in non-U.S. securities may underperform and may be more volatile than comparable U.S. stocks because of the risks involving non-U.S. economies, markets, political systems, regulatory standards, currencies, and taxes. The use of currency derivatives and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may increase investment losses and expenses and create more volatility. Investments in emerging markets present additional risks such as difficulties in selling on a timely basis and at an acceptable price. The intrinsic value of the stocks in which the Funds invest may never be recognized by the broader market. The Funds are often concentrated in fewer sectors than their benchmarks, and the Funds' performance may suffer if these sectors underperform the overall stock market. Investing in equity stocks is risky and subject to the volatility of the markets.

aHF8ZbHmsSWXJv4,Associated Press,yahoo,Europe is slapping tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles ‚Äî for now. Here's what to know,https://apnews.com/article/europe-china-electric-vehicles-customs-trade-705e8f18964b2e77ec076675522bcc83,2024-07-04 10:26,2024-07-04 10:45,ARM,,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) ‚Äî The European Union is imposing sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing‚Äôs burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc. The higher duties go into effect on Friday, pending a final decision in four month‚Äôs time. Here are some basic facts about the EU‚Äôs planned customs duties: What did the European Union do?After an eight-month investigation, the European Commission, the EU‚Äôs executive arm, found that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that means they can undercut rivals in the EU on prices, take a big market share and threaten European jobs. It announced the higher duties on June 12 and they go into effect from Friday. The duties are provisional, meaning they will be totaled up but won‚Äôt need to be paid until they‚Äôre confirmed by a vote of EU governments before Nov. 2. The EU will only collect the duties if there‚Äôs a further finding that the European auto industry would have suffered material harm without them. That gives the EU and the Chinese government time to negotiate. Talks have been held between Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for the economy, and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao, as well as at the level of technical experts.                    RELATED COVERAGE                Philippine military chief warns his forces will fight back if assaulted again in disputed seaLeaders of Russia, China attend summit of regional security groupingFrom ‚Äòlatte makeup‚Äô to ‚Äògirl dinners,‚Äô TikTok has launched tons of trends. Will its influence last?The higher duties are not a goal in themselves but ‚Äúa means to correct an imbalance,‚Äù commission spokesman Eric Mamer said Thursday. ‚ÄúWe certainly hope we can come to a solution which would allow us not to have to move forward on this path.‚ÄùThe rates, if applied, would be: 17.4% on cars from BYD, 19.9% on those from Geely and 37.6% for vehicles exported by China‚Äôs state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden‚Äôs Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain‚Äôs MG, one of Europe‚Äôs bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China including Western companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Tesla would be subject to duties of at least 20.8%. The commission mentioned that Tesla might get an ‚Äúindividually calculated‚Äù rate if duties are definitively imposed. Under EU rules it‚Äôs possible ‚Äî though at present it seems unlikely ‚Äî that the higher duties could be blocked ahead of the Nov. 2 effective date by vote of what the EU calls a ‚Äúqualified majority‚Äù of countries. That means at least 15 of the 27 EU member governments representing at least 65% of the bloc‚Äôs population. Why did the commission take action? Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, the commission said, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices. The commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks. The rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU‚Äôs ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production.Subsidized solar panels from China have wiped out European producers ‚Äî an experience that European governments don‚Äôt want to see repeated with their auto industry. Unusually, the commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European auto industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have been skeptics about the subsidy investigation. That‚Äôs because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and because China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas. How do the EU tariffs compare to ones announced by the U.S.? The Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. At that level, the U.S. tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports.That‚Äôs not what Europe is trying to do. EU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 ‚Äî but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competitionThe planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers. European countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.Just how cheap are Chinese EVs? Chinese carmakers have learned to make electric vehicles cheaply amid ferocious price competition at home in the world‚Äôs largest car market. BYD‚Äôs Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 euros ($23,370) in China but 41,990 euros ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium Group figures. The base model of BYD‚Äôs compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for the equivalent of around $10,000 in China.What does this mean for European drivers and carmakers? It‚Äôs not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese carmakers are able to make some cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising their prices. While consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices in the long term, the commission argues. Currently, Chinese carmakers often sell their vehicles in Europe at much higher prices than the same cars fetch in China, meaning they are favoring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains. Five of BYD‚Äôs six models would still earn a profit in Europe even at a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations.The fear is Europe is that Chinese competitors will turn to lowering their prices closer to the ones they are charging in China. and gain an even bigger chunk of the market.How is China likely to react? Beijing was sharply critical of the higher duties when they were announced, calling them ‚Äúa naked act of protectionism.‚ÄùOn Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said that the two sides had held several rounds of technical consultations and noted that a final EU ruling won‚Äôt be made for four months.‚ÄúIt is hoped that the European side and the Chinese side will move in the same direction, show sincerity, expedite the consultation process and reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible on the basis of facts and rules,‚Äù he said at a weekly media briefing in Beijing.He also said that China hopes the EU will seriously listen to the voices of the European automakers and governments that have come out against the tariffs and avoid anti-subsidy measures that would harm cooperation between the Chinese and European auto industries.It‚Äôs not clear what agreement might look like. One move could be to agree on minimum prices for Chinese cars. China could retaliate against European products such as pork or brandy imports, or against European luxury car imports.Over the longer term, Chinese carmakers could avoid tariffs by making cars in Europe. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain‚Äôs Catalonia region.___Moritsugu reported from Beijing.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

GANs have become the preferred technology in the deepfake AI business because of their distinct architecture and remarkable outcomes. These networks are made up of two competing components: a generator that produces fake content and a discriminator that attempts to discern between actual and fake content. This adversarial setting results in a continuous improvement cycle in which both components drive each other to become more complex. As a result, GANs can generate extremely realistic synthetic media, such as modified photos and movies that are often indistinguishable from real content. Their ability to learn and adapt from large datasets enables them to capture tiny nuances in facial expressions, voice patterns, and body movements, making the resulting deepfakes more realistic.Story continuesRequest Sample Pages@¬†https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=256823035By vertical, media & entertainment segment is poised to account for largest market share in 2024.The media and entertainment industry is expected to hold the largest market share in 2024 due to rising demand for synthetic media generation.

BMZTVOPzvfKLLRZ,USA Today,bing,An electric car-centric world ponders the future of the gas station,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2024/07/04/pumped-up-whats-the-future-of-the-gas-station-in-an-ev-world/74229973007/,2024-07-04 11:00,2024-07-04 11:14,TSLA,,"The humble gas station has evolved massively over the past 140 years or so, from the earliest days when you had to pull around behind a pharmacy to get a fill-up to the sprawling temples of transportation that festoon our highways today. Modern filling stations, or travel centers as they're increasingly known, are much more than places to fuel your car and yourself. With electric vehicles taking an increasing percentage of the market, you might think the days of the filling station are numbered. Signs are pointing to the opposite being true. Most electric car owners charge at home most of the time, but destination charging is still an important part of the EV experience. And because even the fastest chargers and quickest cars can take upward of 20 to 30 minutes to top up on electrons, that gives EV owners more time to kill ‚Äî and, crucially, to spend.What's the future of the gas station? Let's take a look at what's coming down the road.¬†Bigger is betterIf you need proof that the gas station's future is secured, just look at Buc-ee's. The brand started back in 1982, but it took almost 20 years before it started expanding.This year, Buc-ee's will open its 50th location, and it‚Äôs only getting bigger.Bigger, that is, both in terms of number of locations and the sheer size of the things. Until recently, Buc-ee's held the record for the world's largest travel center, at more than 74,000 square feet for its location in Sevierville, Tennessee. But the brand broke its own record earlier this year with a new location in Colorado, then again when it opened its travel center in Luling, Texas. A forthcoming Buc-ee's in Ocala, Florida, will be even bigger. Buc-ee's stations are as known for their amenities as they are for their volume. The brand's restrooms alone have won awards, while the addictively sweet Beaver Nuggets have been raising the blood sugar levels of drivers for years. Upward of 120 gas pumps make the most striking impression upon pulling into one of these places, but increasingly, those pumps are augmented with filling points of another type. Electric chargers are showing up at Buc-ee's in a big way. Tesla made a tentative agreement with the brand in 2021 to install Superchargers in 26 of its travel centers in seven states. It's unclear how many have been deployed since, but one travel center alone in Temple, Texas, offers a whopping 48 chargers, making it one of the biggest Supercharger destinations outside of California.Mercedes-Benz has even bigger plans. In 2023, Mercedes announced that it was creating a higher-end series of chargers for its customers, and an initial step on that path was to partner with Buc-ee's. The plan is to deploy Benz-branded chargers at ""most"" Buc-ee's locations nationwide, covering 30 before the end of this year.But that will just be a part of what Eva Greiner, chief technical officer at Mercedes-Benz Mobility, called ""a brand promise of a high-quality, good customer experience network."" Greiner said that Mercedes decided to get into the charger game because many of its customers were nervous about having a place to charge their EVs, like its Mercedes EQE and EQS lineup of cars and SUVs. ""60 percent of the customers said they don't know where to charge,"" she said. ""They're kind of hesitant.""¬†Another cause for concern was charger availability, but Mercedes is attempting to address that by allowing owners of Mercedes-Benz cars to reserve chargers automatically via their integrated nav systems. By routing to one of the Mercedes-branded charger locations, a reservation will be held automatically, ensuring they can get in and get out as quickly as possible. But still, when it comes to charging, one factor is critical: ""Location is most important,"" Greiner said. ""Location, location, location."" To that end, deploying in established travel centers gives Mercedes easy access to prime real estate. The decidedly blue-collar Buc-ee's feels like an unusual partnership for a premium brand like Benz. However, compared to the current slate of charging options, that points the way to some big upgrades, and Mercedes isn't the only company raising the bar.Plug-In hybrids:Why you may want to rethink this carA new charging experienceLocation might be key for charging, but amenities are an increasingly important factor. As any EV owner will tell you, particularly an early adopter who's been driving emissions-free for a fair few years, the modern charging experience is often far from glamorous. Many EV chargers linger in the back corner of an oil-stained, dimly lit section of parking lot asphalt. If you're lucky, there's a grocery store or Walmart nearby, but as often as not, you're stuck sitting in your car idly scanning TikTok with an uncomfortably full bladder. That's changing. Amaiya Khardenavis, analyst of EV charging infrastructure at the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, likens the early days of charging infrastructure expansion to a ""land grab"" where every charger company was throwing down plugs wherever they could, with little thought about amenities or anything else. That, though, is changing.""Amenities are very important at any user location,"" Khardenavis said. ""You can't just leave them stranded for 25 or 30 minutes without having anything around them."" Khardenavis said that increasing EV adoption means the companies running the charging networks are finally starting to see a return on investment. In turn, they're making more investments in their networks. ""I think that Electrify America's launch of the indoor location, with the lounge, Wi-Fi access and everything of that sort, is a really good first step into the foray of the future of public charging,"" he said. Khardenavis was referring to Electrify America's new flagship charging location in San Francisco. The site hosts 20 chargers in a different configuration than anything the company has deployed yet in its six-year history of deploying EV charging stations. The indoor, well-lit space features vending machines, bathrooms and even areas where someone can take a meeting or just get out of their car and stretch their legs for a little while.For EA, it's something of a halo moment. ""We really wanted to make it this kind of inspirational project that could highlight the benefits of driving an EV and bring the community of EV drivers together in one large format location,"" Anthony Lambkin said. He's VP of operations at Electrify America.¬†That one in San Francisco is the first, but there will be more. ""We're working on a number right now,"" Lambkin said, including others in California and New York.That's entertainmentWhile EV charging is getting better and faster, EV owners of the future are still going to find themselves spending plenty of time lingering around these travel centers. Thankfully, charging locations are starting to offer not only better conveniences but also more things to do.Tesla has been playing with the idea of entertainment at its Supercharger locations for years. In 2022, the company added a swimming pool at one of its German chargers. Although the implementation was a bit underwhelming (it was basically a shipping container full of water), the concept at least was good.¬†The company has continued to experiment with destination charging.While plenty of chargers are close to movie theaters and the like, one of Tesla‚Äôs newest will feature not one but two theaters in the building, which is appropriately being built in Hollywood. It's scheduled to open sometime this year. Given the amount that Tesla charges for idle fees if you leave your car sitting in a Supercharger stall when it isn't charging, up to a dollar a minute, you might think that sitting down for a Hollywood epic would be a costly proposition. But plans for this location mentioned featuring shorter films, averaging around 30 minutes. It will also feature a 24-hour restaurant, making it a place you might legitimately want to spend some time ‚Äî assuming the resulting product is a little more appealing than that shipping crate full of water. Easier Payment Comes with Plusses and MinusesWireless EV charging:It‚Äôs coming. And it's fast.Paying for gasoline with cash was never that convenient, but with the stuff approaching $4 per gallon on average in the U.S. right now, forking over that much green is even more awkward. It's a little less painful if you just swipe or tap your credit card, but that still means fumbling through your wallet. If you're filling up in Fargo, North Dakota, in January, you'd probably rather keep your mittens on.Paying for fuel and plenty of other things is about to get much easier. Visa has partnered with Daimler to develop a new generation of in-car payments called Pay+. The basic idea is to register your card with your car and then use that card to pay for everything from gas to tolls. Eventually, Visa says you could even use it to pay your auto insurance directly if, for some reason, you're averse to online automatic payment plans. Convenience is the leading factor here, but this upcoming technology has a somewhat dark side. While the rise of the software-defined vehicle has made for cars that evolve and grow thanks to over-the-air (OTA) updates, manufacturers are increasingly offering premium features, everything from higher horsepower to hands-free driving.Having a virtual wallet within your car will make it much easier to tap your way into unlocking whatever premium digital upgrade we used to get for free. This same payment method could also make paying for EV charging easier, but other technologies are helping to address that, too. Plug & Charge is the umbrella term for your car, which automatically handles the handshake and payment when you plug into a charger, storing account and payment information for multiple chargers. And the rising adoption of Tesla's North American Charging Standard, or NACS, will only make the process smoother. While many existing cars will need to use adapters for the next few years, they should be able to plug in and start charging directly without loading smartphone apps or scanning QR codes, things that are even more awkward to do without your mittens when it's 20 below.¬†From fossil to E-fuelsAnd what about gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles? Do they have a place in this future? Absolutely. Even if the most optimistic plans to transition away from internal combustion come to pass, traditional cars powered by combustible fuels will be a significant part of the transportation landscape for decades to come. But the nature of those fuels may change.We've already seen a major push to blend ethanol into gasoline to boost the renewability of traditional gasoline, but next-generation fuels may come from even more exotic sources. Synthetic fuel, or e-fuel, is a major global research topic and subject to billions in investments. Porsche is one of those investors, putting $75 million into a project called HIF Global. A pilot plant in Chile, which you can read all about here, is capable of outputting 34,000 gallons of e-fuels for use by Porsche's various global marketing and motorsports events. These fuels are literally made of air and water, with a theoretically neutral environmental impact.¬†The output from HIF's Chile facility is nowhere near enough even to dent current or future gasoline demands in the United States. But with another, far larger plant scheduled to begin construction in Texas this year, there's the potential to start offsetting a meaningful amount of fossil fuels. And with enough investment and incentives, these fuels could even replace fossil fuels if we look far enough down the road. So one way or another, even if traditional gasoline's days are numbered, the gas station's future looks brighter than ever.Photos by Ryan Lugo",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main goals of the information given were my desire to help Seeking Alpha readers be more aware of the issue of analyzing financial risks, the clinical data of a company's medicines, its financial metrics, and the need to take into account the influence of its competitors to ultimately make more informed decisions and maximize the profit from investments. Global obesity treatment market The global obesity treatment market is of enormous interest not only because it is expected to be worth more than $100 billion by 2030 but also because only two of the eight FDA-approved medications are currently extremely popular for weight control. As a result, there is still significant potential for growth in sales of medicines developed by Wall Street mastodons such as Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). However, I also believe that commercial opportunities remain for smaller companies, the analysis of which will be presented later in the article. Overall, the clinical data from semaglutide and tirzepatide indicate that anti-obesity medications have the potential to be effective, including in reducing the risk of progression of kidney disease and major adverse cardiovascular events, as well as in the treatment of other diseases, including obstructive sleep apnea, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, osteoarthritis of the knee and more. According to IQVIA, there are currently around 120 drugs in development for obesity treatment. Given the tremendous success of Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, this requires others in the obesity treatment market to develop medications with more effective mechanisms of action that can not only provide better weight-loss outcomes but also address the problem of muscle loss caused by the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. In addition, I believe that the efforts of pharmaceutical companies should be aimed not only at finding molecules with higher clinical efficacy relative to competitors but also their product candidates should have a lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including nausea and diarrhea, to ultimately meet the needs of people living with obesity. In the table, I have indicated the most promising drugs and their mechanisms of action.   Source: table made by the Author of the articleCompanies, for one reason or another that do not currently have a favorable risk/reward profile However, there are other factors to consider when investing in the healthcare sector, so not all of the companies listed below have a favorable risk/reward profile at the moment. So, according to my methodology, I exclude Altimmune (ALT) and Terns Pharmaceuticals (TERN) since their market capitalization is below $500 million. However, it will be useful for Seeking Alpha readers to know that pemvidutide, which is a dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonist, demonstrated encouraging data in a phase 2 clinical trial. So, in a group of patients taking Altimmune's product candidate at a dose of 2.4 mg, body weight decreased by 15.6% by 48 weeks. However, an MRI-based body composition analysis of 50 patients showed that the average loss of lean mass was 21.9%. By comparison, in a 68-week trial, weight loss in patients taking Novo Nordisk's Wegovy was associated with a 39.5% loss of muscle mass.   Source: AltimmuneLet's move on to discuss Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), which is one of my favorites in the healthcare sector and which brought me significant profits in 2023. It has an extremely promising portfolio of investigational drugs being developed to treat metabolic and endocrine disorders. According to Seeking Alpha data, analysts have an average price target of $112 for Viking Therapeutics, indicating a potential growth of over 100% from its current share price. One of the reasons why Wall Street analysts believe Viking Therapeutics has a bright future is the excellent results from Phase 2, which assessed the efficacy of VK2735 in treating patients with obesity.   Source: Seeking AlphaSo, in the group of patients taking VK2735 at a dose of 15 mg, the average reduction in body weight was 14.7% at the end of the 13-week course of treatment. This value is significantly higher than that of all FDA-approved drugs currently.   Source: Viking TherapeuticsHowever, the FDA could potentially request an additional Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate VK2735's additional dose strengths and/or frequency of dosing, which would increase the time to start a pivotal clinical trial, as well as due to the incomplete technical correction of its stock price, I believe that Viking Therapeutics does not currently have a favorable risk/reward profile.   Source: TradingViewI also believe that Eli Lilly does not have a favorable risk/reward profile at the moment, as stated in ""Eli Lilly: Good Performance, But A Hold,"" due to the lack of strong catalysts on the near horizon after Kisunla was approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, its trailing 12-month P/E ratio is 124.6x, and by 2026, although it will drop to 36.2x, it will still be significantly higher than that of the sector, but also Novo Nordisk. However, its obesity franchise is robust, including through Zepbound (tirzepatide). So, its sales amounted to $517.4 million in the first three months of 2024, which is approximately 3 times more than the previous quarter thanks to an avalanche-like growth in demand for it due to its highest efficacy in the global obesity treatment market at the moment.   Source: graph was made by Author based on 10-Qs and 10-KsAlso, as I already indicated in the previous article, on April 17, 2024, Eli Lilly pleased investors with data from two Phase 3 clinical trials showing that the group of patients taking tirzepatide experienced a significant reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index relative to the placebo group. The company's product also contributed to a statistically significant improvement in sleep apnea symptoms. If approved by the FDA and EMA, tirzepatide would be the first pharmaceutical treatment for tens of millions of adults with obstructive sleep apnea.   Source: Eli LillyIn addition to the growth in sales of Zepbound, Eli Lilly continues to actively develop its obesity franchise with the ultimate goal of strengthening its position in the market.   Source: Eli LillySo, in my assessment, the company's most promising drug is retatrutide, which is a GLP-1/GIP/glucagon receptor triagonist. At the end of June 2023, Eli Lilly published the data of a phase 2 clinical trial that demonstrated the outstanding efficacy of its experimental drug among obese individuals without diabetes. At the 24th week of treatment, the group of patients taking retatrutide 12 mg experienced a decrease in body weight by 17.5%, and by the end of the 48-week course of treatment, this value increased to 24.2%.   Source: Eli LillyThe company is currently conducting several pivotal studies to evaluate the efficacy of retatrutide in the treatment of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and knee osteoarthritis in participants who have obesity.   Source: Eli LillyAlso, according to my steps for selecting the most promising pharmaceutical companies, I exclude Structure Therapeutics (GPCR), Zealand Pharma (OTCPK:ZLDPF), and Boehringer Ingelheim for the following reasons noted in the table below.   Source: table made by the Author of the articleCompanies with a favorable risk/reward profile in the anti-obesity therapeutics market Let's finally move on to the most interesting part of the article, namely my list of the most investment-attractive pharmaceutical companies in the global anti-obesity drugs market. The first of these was Novo Nordisk, the analysis of which was presented in the previous article ""How To Pick Top Pharma Stocks: Novo Nordisk And More."" Amgen Amgen (AMGN) is a pharmaceutical company with a leading position in the global autoimmune disease and cancer therapeutics markets. My previous article, ""Amgen: You Haven't Seen Anything Yet,"" which was published on June 17, provided a detailed analysis of the company's financial results for the first quarter of 2024. However, some of Seeking Alpha's readers may have missed it. As a result, the table below shows the growth rate of revenue, operating income, and other metrics, including its P/E ratio, which once again underscores why Amgen is attracting significant attention from financial market participants.   Source: Seeking AlphaIn recent years, the company's management, recognizing the significant commercial opportunities in the market for obesity drugs, has continued to invest substantial financial and research resources in the development of its franchise. So, in my opinion, one of the most promising drugs in Amgen's portfolio, which has attracted the attention of Wall Street like a magnet in recent months, is MariTide (maridebart cafraglutide). The mechanism of action of this molecule is complex since, on the one hand, it is a GIPR antagonist, and on the other hand, it activates glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors. To further understand, Novo Nordisk's Ozempic, Wegovy, and Trulicity are GLP-1 receptor agonists, meaning they activate the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor. On February 5, 2024, Amgen and Nature published the results of a clinical study that shocked me in that a group of patients taking the highest dose of MariTide led to a loss of 14.5% body weight on the 85th day, which today is significantly higher compared to such blockbusters as semaglutide and Eli Lilly's tirzepatide. Currently, the company is working to complete a Phase 2 clinical trial and is committed to moving forward with pivotal clinical studies to determine the efficacy of MariTide in the fight against type 2 diabetes and obesity. On May 2, Dr. James Bradner, the Chief Scientific Officer of Amgen, said the following on the quarterly earnings call. We're seeing a differentiated profile of MariTide and are confident that it will address important unmet medical needs, obesity, obesity-related conditions and diabetes. We look forward to completing the ongoing Phase II study and working with regulators to move rapidly to the broad Phase III program. Pfizer Pfizer (PFE) is a pharmaceutical company whose share price has returned to an upward trend despite continued pessimism from retail investors. My previous article, ""Pfizer: Seriously Undervalued At Peak Pessimism,"" which was published on June 23, provided a detailed analysis of the company's financial results for the first quarter of 2024. However, for those readers who may have missed it, I have summarized Pfizer's dividend yield, as well as its growth rate in revenue, operating income and other metrics over recent quarters.   Source: Seeking AlphaJust like Amgen, Pfizer management is seeking to bite off a share of the obesity treatment market from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. On December 1, 2023, the company published the results of a phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of danuglipron, which is a non-peptide GLP-1 receptor agonist. So, patients taking danuglipron 120 mg led to a decrease in body weight by 11.7% by the end of 32 weeks, while those who took placebo had an increase in body weight by 1.4%. Also, although the safety profile of the experimental drug was acceptable, one of its disadvantages is the frequency of dosing, namely the need to take it twice a day. As a result, the company works on its once-daily formulation. Albert Bourla, who is the CEO of Pfizer, said the following on the last quarterly earnings call. So, we are waiting around mid-year to get the totality of the data that relates to the once-a-day formulation. And then based on the data and everything else, we will make decisions for future plans. Also, at the end of June, Albert Bourla encouraged investors by announcing that Pfizer was analyzing three new product candidates for weight loss. The mechanism of action, two of which are based on the activation of GLP-1 receptors, but he kept silent about how the third medication works. Roche Holding Roche Holding (OTCQX:RHHBY) is the largest Swiss pharmaceutical company, whose diagnostic solutions were in great demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, it has an extensive portfolio of medicines for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory diseases, rare diseases, eye disorders and more. Since the topic of this article is √¢¬Ä¬úanalysis of the obesity treatment market√¢¬Ä¬ù and because I plan to publish an in-depth analysis of the financial results of the company and its pipeline of experimental drugs, the table below highlights only the values √¢¬Ä¬ã√¢¬Ä¬ã√¢¬Ä¬ã√¢¬Ä¬ãof key Roche Holding metrics indicating that it is trading at a discount relative to the sector, as well as some of its competitors, including Merck (MRK), AbbVie (ABBV), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), and AstraZeneca (AZN).   Source: Seeking AlphaOn May 16, 2024, news published by a Swiss pharmaceutical company caused a furor among financial market participants. So, patients taking CT-388, which is a GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, led to a decrease in average placebo-adjusted weight loss by 18.8% at the end of the 24-week course of treatment. In addition, Roche stated that this experimental drug was well tolerated without disclosing full data on adverse events that occurred. Takeaway In this article, I presented an analysis of the global market for obesity drugs, which, according to JPMorgan analysts (JPM), will exceed $100 billion by 2030. In the first part, a list of the most promising drugs that demonstrate promising clinical results in the fight against obesity was presented. However, not all companies developing them have a favorable risk/reward profile. On the other hand, in my opinion, Novo Nordisk, Roche Holding, Amgen, and Pfizer are attractive stocks for long-term investors interested in the healthcare sector.

eS1DloVGH0Nwiak,Inside EVs,google,GMC Hummer EV SUV Is One Of The Best EVs. Too Bad It‚Äôs For Nobody: Doug DeMuro,https://insideevs.com/news/725356/2024-gmc-hummer-ev-review-doug-demuro-video/,2024-07-04 12:00,2024-07-04 12:08,GM,,"Ever since its debut three years ago, the GMC Hummer EV SUV has been a regular appearance in YouTube videos, thanks to its size, polarizing looks and impressive spec sheet. Now, famous car reviewer and InsideEVs friend Doug DeMuro got his hands on a 2024 GMC Hummer EV SUV in 3X trim and made a video where he talked about all the quirks and features, as he does with all the cars he drives. Until we finish our own review of the battery-powered Hummer, let‚Äôs see what DeMuro has to say about the crab-walking electric SUV.   Get Fully Charged   Tech-filled bonanza  The 2024 GMC Hummer EV, be it the pickup or SUV, has over a dozen camera angles, including video feeds from underneath the car. The brawny electric truck also comes as standard with four-wheel steering, adjustable air suspension and infotainment system graphics that look like they were lifted straight from a video game.    Sales of both the pickup and SUV variants of the Hummer EV haven‚Äôt been anything to write home about, with General Motors moving just 1,668 units in the first quarter. Things might have improved in Q2, as GM recently announced that it sold a record number of EVs in the previous three months, but we don‚Äôt have hard numbers yet, so we‚Äôll see how the humongous EV fared.  More Hummer EV Stories           The Tesla Cybertruck Beat The Rivian R1T In U.S. Registrations           The $79,995 Base GMC Hummer EV Is Reportedly Dead           Electrified Hummer H1 Has Old-School Looks, Same Power As New GMC Hummer EV           2024 GMC Hummer EV Pickup And SUV EPA Range And Pricing Overview    Production-related issues are partly to blame for the poor sales performance of GMC‚Äôs resurrected Hummer, but as Doug DeMuro says in the video embedded at the top of this page, the fact that it‚Äôs such a brash-looking thing might have alienated every possible customer base. People who usually consider getting an EV wouldn‚Äôt necessarily look at the Hummer EV SUV because it‚Äôs too big, too flashy and rather energy inefficient, while people who prefer big trucks don‚Äôt usually consider an EV, including one that can sprint to 60 miles per hour in under four seconds, can tow up to 11,500 pounds and has a driving range of up to 314 miles on a full charge. Customer preferences aside, DeMuro says that the battery-powered Hummer EV SUV has a ‚Äúsurprisingly luxurious‚Äù interior, although the steering wheel column stalks have been lifted straight from the GM parts bin and feel cheap compared to the rest of the cabin.

The annoying bit is that the same button can‚Äôt be used to raise all the windows back up, which means the driver has to individually close them using the separate buttons on the door and headliner. Another detail that might annoy people is the icon for the air recirculation function, which shows the pickup version of the Hummer EV even in the SUV. Apart from all these little niggles, Doud DeMuro describes GM‚Äôs brawny EV as being supercar-fast‚Äìfaster than a Porsche Carrera GT, in fact‚Äìcool, surprisingly comfortable and a great all-around vehicle, as long as you can get around the brutish styling and rather high starting price of $100,000.

Their net worth is estimated to be $250 million.This has all come legally without any insider information as Paul Pelosi is a savvy investor and Nancy Pelosi is a successful public servant.¬†If they did anything illegal in investing, ethics complaints would have been filed against her long ago.¬†His firm would have been reported to the authorities and shut down.¬†An investigative committee in Congress would have been formed.¬†Just look at the jail time and negative press Paul Pelosi got for a DUI. Imagine what would happen from felonies like insider trading, securities fraud, and tax evasion!Many politicians and reporters would love to ‚Äúmake their bones‚Äù by taking down Pelosi for insider trading. None of this has happened because they have done nothing wrong in their investing.What they have done right is invest in what they know, like Peter¬†Lynch, and bought quality like Warren Buffett. Representing a district close to Silicon Valley, their portfolio has the biggest and best tech stocks starting¬†with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG; NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).If there were an investing guide for Nancy Pelosi stocks, the mission statement would be to invest in companies with a California¬†presence active in the tech community.¬†The following are two stocks the Pelosis should consider and a third that she‚Äôs already trading. Each is active in California in some aspect of tech.Archer Aviation (ACHR)Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comArcher Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) has plans for ports for flying car taxis near San Francisco, the heart of Pelosi‚Äôs district. The city is affluent with Silicon Valley, Napa Valley and world-class beaches nearby. Along with paradise comes traffic jams, meaning plenty of business for flying taxis.This is a good time to buy Archer, as the stock is down. Most of the market‚Äôs gains have come from mega-cap tech stocks. It would add balance to Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs stock portfolio, as it leads in its area of tech.This can be seen in Archer Aviation‚Äôs financials. There is little debt, which shows the company does not have to leverage its future to finance its operations. Earnings per share are up more than double digits this year and are expected to rise almost 10% next year. Strong insider ownership shows bullish sentiment for Archer from those who know it best.First Citizens Bancshares (FCNCA)Source: shutterstock.com/rafapressHistory repeats itself with First Citizens Bancshares (NASDAQ:FCNCA), based in Raleigh, North Carolina acquiring the assets of Silicon Valley Bank. It was another stellar North Carolina bank, NationsBank from Charlotte, that bought Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), then headquartered in San Francisco, and took the name. Bank of America is now based in Charlotte. First Citizens now has a substantial presence in the California tech community as its banker.Gobbling up assets from failed Texas institutions in the 1980s made NationsBank a national institution. With a presence in California as the banker for the tech sector, First Citizens is now a national player. The stock rose more than 30% last year.Expect more as the profit margin is high and the price-to-earnings ratio is low, which is generally a bullish combination. Another nice one-two is high institutional ownership and a low short float. This and the stock rise show that hedge funds and other institutional investors are bullish on its expansion into California‚Äôs tech community.Nvidia (NVDA)Source: gguy / Shutterstock.comIf you were to believe the negative press about Nancy Pelosi stocks, you would think their holdings in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are insider dealings. But this is ridiculous as Nvidia, based close to Pelosi‚Äôs district, is the darling of Wall Street! The Pelosis made nearly $4 million on NVDA call options that they purchased late last year.There have been about 20 positive analyst ratings for Nvidia in the last month. There has been one for Alphabet in the last year. Suffice it to say there are a lot of bonuses riding on Nvidia, so expect the analyst crowd to do what they can to keep the price rising.A Truist analyst expects Nvidia to earn $140 a share. The recent stock split will facilitate that rise, as will a profit margin of over 50%, with sales and earnings soaring.On the date of publication, Jonathan Yates did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That‚Äôs what happened during the week of July 1.Views are mixed on Wood, who may be the country‚Äôs best-known investor after Warren Buffett. Boosters say she‚Äôs a technology visionary, while detractors say she‚Äôs just a mediocre money manager.Related: Cathie Wood net worth: Why the Ark Invest CEO is an investor to watchWood (Mama Cathie to her followers) rocketed to acclaim after a stupendous return of 153% in 2020 and lucid presentations of her investment philosophy in numerous media appearances.Cathie Wood is a controversial figure in the investment world.PATRICK T. FALLON/Getty ImagesBut her longer-term performance is less impressive. Wood‚Äôs flagship Ark Innovation ETF¬† (ARKK) , with $6.2 billion in assets, produced annualized returns of 1.09% for the last 12 months, -28.94% for the past three years and -0.4% for five years.That‚Äôs quite woeful compared to the S&P 500. The index posted positive annualized returns of 26.16% for one year, 10.05% for three years, and 14.94% for five years. Ark Innovation‚Äôs numbers also fall well shy of Wood's goal for annual returns of at least 15% over five-year periods.Cathie Wood‚Äôs straightforward strategyHer investment philosophy is pretty simple. Ark ETFs usually purchase emerging-company stocks in the high-tech categories of artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. Wood maintains that companies in those categories will change the world.Of course, these stocks are quite volatile, so the Ark funds‚Äô values frequently fluctuate up and down. Wood adds to and subtracts from her top names frequently.Investment research titan Morningstar offers a harsh assessment of Wood and the Ark Innovation ETF. Investing in young companies with slim earnings ‚Äúdemands forecasting talent, which ARK Investment Management lacks,‚Äù Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold wrote in March.The potential of Wood‚Äôs five high-tech platforms listed above is ‚Äúcompelling,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut the firm‚Äôs ability to spot winners and manage their myriad risks is less so‚Ä¶. It has not proved it is worth the risks it takes.‚ÄùRelated: Cathie Wood sells $4.3 million of Nvidia stockThis isn‚Äôt your parent‚Äôs investment portfolio. ‚ÄúResults range from tremendous to horrendous‚Äù for Wood‚Äôs young, often unprofitable stocks, Greengold said.Wood has defended herself from Morningstar‚Äôs criticism. ‚ÄúI do know there are companies like that one [Morningstar] that do not understand what we're doing,‚Äù she told Magnifi Media by Tifin in 2022.‚ÄúWe do not fit into their style boxes. And I think style boxes will become a thing of the past, as technology blurs the lines between and among sectors.‚ÄùStory continuesBut some of Wood‚Äôs customers apparently agree with Morningstar. Over the past 12 months, Ark Innovation ETF suffered a net investment outflow of $2 billion, according to ETF research firm VettaFi.What Cathie Wood sold last weekOn July 2-3, Ark funds unloaded 76,080 shares of electric vehicle titan Tesla¬† (TSLA) . That chunk of stock was worth $18.7 million as of the July 3 close.Tesla shares jumped 17% July 1-2, after the company reported stronger-than-expected output and deliveries for the second quarter. The surge came despite the fact that deliveries dropped 4.8% from a year earlier, and production fell 14%.Related: Analysts reset Tesla stock price targets as robotaxi event loomsWood probably booked substantial profit on her Tesla sales, as for years she has been a devotee of its Chief Executive Elon Musk.Last month, she forecast that Tesla stock will hit $2,600 in 2029. That represents a 10-fold rise from the July 3 close of $246.40. The stock already has rebounded 73% from April 22.Tesla is the biggest holding in Ark Innovation ETF.Morningstar's view on TeslaThe company is slated to release its full second-quarter earnings report July 23. Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein foresees mixed news.‚ÄúWe expect the company will report lower revenue and profits versus the prior-year quarter,‚Äù he wrote in a commentary.Fund manager buys and sells:Veteran fund manager sounds alarm on stocksCathie Wood sells $11 million of soaring fintech stockVeteran analyst just bought this under-the-radar housing stock‚ÄúHowever, sequentially [quarter-over-quarter], we expect Tesla will begin to see stabilizing automotive gross profit margins versus the first quarter.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs because ‚Äúthe company will begin to see lower unit production costs and benefit from lower raw materials costs,‚Äù Goldstein said.‚ÄúWhile we forecast lower revenue and profits, we see margin recovery in the second half of the year.

FaM7ijaf2C9loyU,Seeking Alpha,bing,Novo Nordisk: Buy On Dips,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702480-novo-nordisk-buy-on-dips,2024-07-04 12:52,2024-07-04 13:00,LLY,,"Carolina Rudah There√¢¬Ä¬ôs exactly one reason that drew me to write on the Danish pharmaceuticals company Novo Nordisk (NVO) (OTCPK:NONOF) today. And that√¢¬Ä¬ôs Ozempic. As it happens, there has been such a steady stream of its mention in my news and podcast feeds, my curiosity was piqued. I√¢¬Ä¬ôd even go so far as to say that its popularity might have come second only to updates on the all important general elections being held in various parts of the world this year. The point is, that a medical treatment becoming a regular feature in pop culture conversation says something. Something about the size of the problem (no pun intended) it addresses. In my article on Eli Lilly (LLY) (see section on √¢¬Ä¬òWinning in the Diabetes market√¢¬Ä¬ô of the link), I had mentioned the extent of challenge that weight and associated lifestyle diseases represent. And these closely correlate with Ozempic√¢¬Ä¬ôs effect as well. But being newsworthy is not the same as being a good investment. So here I take a closer look at Novo Nordisk to assess whether there's an upside to the stock or not. Advantage Ozempic and Wegovy Technically, Ozempic is a diabetes medication, which regulates blood sugar. But √¢¬Ä¬úweight loss is a common side effect√¢¬Ä¬ù as University of California, Davis [UC Davis] points out. UC Davis also notes that √¢¬Ä¬úIt is not approved for weight loss, but some physicians prescribe it to be used for weight loss√¢¬Ä¬ù. Novo Nordisk√¢¬Ä¬ôs weight management drug is actually Wegovy, which has the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Ozempic leads sales But Ozempic stands out as the company's leading treatment (see chart below), bringing in 41% of its revenues in 2023, with Wegovy bringing in another 13.5%. The weight management and diabetes segment all together is its mainstay contributing to 93% of the sales last year.   Source: Statista Diabetes and obesity care show above average growth Clearly, the focus segment is doing very well for Novo Nordisk, which saw a 22% sales growth at market exchange rates [MER] and 24% at constant exchange rates [CER] in DKK terms in the first quarter (Q1 2024). The Diabetes and Obesity care segment saw slightly higher growth of 25% at MER and 27% at CER, pulling up overall growth. The latest numbers follow the already robust 36% CER increase in 2023, with 42% growth for Diabetes and Obesity care. Further expansion seen Moreover, the growth is expected only to continue as Wegovy was recently approved by China. This is a particular positive considering that China is the biggest pharmaceuticals market in the world after the US. So far, Novo Nordisk has only limited exposure to it, with it having a less than 7% share in its sales as of 2023. Wegovy might be just the recipe for greater inroads into the market, going by the fact that 1.4 billion people in China are either overweight or obese. The treatment has also been approved in the US for people at with or at risk of cardiovascular disease due to weight management challenges. Positive full year outlook In line with the continued boom in its focus market, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs little wonder that Novo Nordisk√¢¬Ä¬ôs full year outlook is not just positive, but was also upgraded (see graphic below). At the midpoint of the new guidance range, sales are expected to increase by 23%, which isn't very different from that seen in Q1 2024. The company√¢¬Ä¬ôs operating profits are also seen growing at a fast clip, with 26% increase seen at the midpoint of the guidance range, which is lower than the 30% CER rise seen in Q1 2024. However, it may well come in at the top end of the range, in line with the last quarter. Assuming however, that the operating profit does come in at the midpoint of the range and the ratio of net profit to operating profit remains at ~80%, the same as in Q1 2024, the net profit would come to DKK 103.1 billion. This is also a healthy growth of 23.2% YoY.   Source: Novo Nordisk Rising challenges However, while all appears to be going very well for Novo Nordisk, challenges are visible too. Here are three of them: #1. Health risks: While there are good reviews available for both the Ozempic and Wegovy, they have also come under fire recently. Some 7-9% of users of these treatments are seen as at risk of nothing short of blindness. To be fair, some risk exists even for alternate medications. But it's a comparatively far lower rate of 0.8-1.8%. #2. Prices in the US: The company, along with Eli Lilly, has also come under fire for charging √¢¬Ä¬úunconscionably high prices√¢¬Ä¬ù in the US by none other than President Biden. In an opinion article for USA Today earlier this week, he points out that if prescribed by a doctor, √¢¬Ä¬ú√¢¬Ä¬¶ the prices of Ozempic and Wegovy can be up to six times higher than prices in Canada, Germany, Denmark and other major countries.√¢¬Ä¬ù. The upshot of the article for Novo Nordisk is essentially that its margins could be set for a decline in the US, which isn't trivial either. The US is the biggest market for Novo Nordisk, with a 63% contribution to sales as of 2023. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs also worth adding that the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs EBIT margin at 44.1% in 2023 was significantly ahead of its biggest peers by market capitalisation. Even Eli Lilly, which comes next, for example, had a far lower margin of 31.6% during the year. #3. Rising competition: Finally, the success of its treatments and the big market for weight management is set to increase competition as well. Last month, the Swiss pharmaceutical stock Roche Holding AG (OTCQX:RHHBY) made gains on positive results from its weight management treatment√¢¬Ä¬ôs clinical trials. Also, after a disappointment last year on its obesity treatment√¢¬Ä¬ôs side effects, Pfizer (PFE) is now testing three new drugs too. While these treatments will take their time to come to market, the fact is that Novo Nordisk√¢¬Ä¬ôs sales growth may well slow down over time as a result. Steep market multiples With a price rise of 40% year-to-date [YTD}, Novo Nordisk√¢¬Ä¬ôs market multiples aren√¢¬Ä¬ôt looking attractive right now. Based on the estimate for net income made earlier, the forward GAAP price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio comes to 41.5x. This is not just substantially higher than the average of 27.1x for the healthcare sector but also the stock√¢¬Ä¬ôs own five-year average of 30.5x. However, the forward ratio is for the year 2024. Since we are midway through, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs also worthwhile to look at the ratio for 2025. This is improved, at 32.7x, as per the average of analysts√¢¬Ä¬ô estimates on Seeking Alpha, but not enough to make it attractive. What next? Unless the company upgrades its earnings outlook again, for now, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs hard to make a Buy case for Novo Nordisk. Even if it does make an upgrade, the gap between the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs past average and current forward P/E is so big, it might still indicate overvaluation. In any case, it remains to be seen whether another revision even happens, after President Biden has been critical of its prices, which could impact margins going forward. Whether or not it happens is debatable as the US goes to elections later this year, but it√¢¬Ä¬ôs worth bearing in mind. Rising competition over time among weight management products can be another drag on the company. That said, though, for now it looks very good fundamentally. Specifically, Ozempic is hugely popular even as its side effects are becoming increasingly known. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs a big contributor to Novo Nordisk√¢¬Ä¬ôs sales, which are expected to continue being healthy going forward into the year and for now its margins look strong too. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs a pity, really, for investors who√¢¬Ä¬ôd like to buy the stock. But it√¢¬Ä¬ôs worth watching and buying on significant dips. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm going with a Hold on Novo Nordisk.

This facility will supply LNG bunkering vessels with refueling services in the Vancouver region. Strategically located adjacent to FortisBC's existing Tilbury LNG facility, the jetty will leverage the facility's production of LNG, which is less carbonintensive compared to the global average due to its use of hydroelectric power.LNG reduces local air pollutants, this is especially important for ports and populated coastal areas. With about 3,100 ships calling on the Port of Vancouver each year, switching from conventional marine fuel to LNG marine fuel could remove 90 per cent of the particulate matter associated with marine shipping from the local airshed, according to a third-party study.ADVERTISEMENTIn 2022,¬†FortisBC and Musqueam Indian Band (x ∑m…ôŒ∏k ∑…ôyÃì …ôm) signed an agreement that will see both parties working in close collaboration as the Tilbury projects are developed.

Yet a handful of stocks get all the attention from the media, analysts and investors. These tend to be the mega-cap tech stocks that dominate the market and are responsible for the majority of its gains and losses. Attention tends to go to companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) because they have so much influence over the market‚Äôs direction instead of some under-the-radar tech stocks.While it makes sense that the most influential stocks should get most of the attention, it also means many great under-the-radar tech stocks. This is disappointing as many of these neglected stocks are quietly rising and beating the returns seen in the broader market. Spotting these hidden gems can add big gains to a portfolio.Here are three under-the-radar tech stocks with millionaire-maker upside.  Applied Materials (AMAT)Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.comApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) doesn‚Äôt get nearly as much attention as it deserves. Companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) use the microchip-equipment maker‚Äôs components. Yet the company and its stock receive only a fraction of the media attention given to its customers. This is largely due to Applied Materials being a going concern since 1967 and being viewed as Silicon Valley‚Äôs founding father.Some of Applied Materials‚Äô equipment is so old that it is housed at the Smithsonian Museum. Regardless of its age, Applied Materials is still posting strong financial results, and its stock is responding. For its fiscal second quarter, Applied Materials most recently announced EPS of $2.09, which was ahead of analyst consensus estimates that called for a profit of $1.99 a share. Revenue totaled $6.65 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $6.54 billion.The strong results and bullish forward guidance continue to send AMAT stock higher. In the last 12 months, Applied Materials‚Äô share price has risen 67%.Palo Alto Networks (PANW)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comFor an under-the-radar cybersecurity stock, look to Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). The company‚Äôs stock is up 18% this year, but it badly trails the gains seen in its competitors, such as CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), whose share price has gained 57%. The big problem at Palo Alto Networks is that the company has missed Wall Street forecasts on several occasions.Most recently, Palo Alto Networks reported quarterly billings that missed analyst estimates, sending its stock down nearly 10%. For the company‚Äôs fiscal third quarter, billings came in at $2.33 billion, missing analysts‚Äô average estimate of $2.34 billion. U.S. Analysts see the disappointing billing figure as a sign of reduced corporate spending on cybersecurity solutions, creating headwinds.Despite the near-term challenges, 38 Wall Street analysts who cover the company rate Palo Alto Networks‚Äô stock a ‚Äústrong buy‚Äù and expect future gains.Analog Devices (ADI)Source: sdecoret / Shutterstock.comLike Applied Materials, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a semiconductor company whose stock flies under the radar of most investors but nevertheless outperforms. So far, in 2024, ADI stock is up nearly 20%. In the last five years, the share price has more than doubled. Also, like Applied Materials, Analog Devices continues to post strong quarterly prints that underpin its share price.In May of this year, Analog Devices announced EPS of $1.40 for its fiscal second quarter, beating analysts‚Äô consensus forecast of $1.26. Revenue came in at $2.16 billion, beating expectations for $2.11 billion. The company, which makes semiconductors used in data conversion and signal processing, attributed the strong results to rising orders and demand for its products, particularly in the automotive and industrial sectors.Looking ahead, Analog Devices raised its forecast for the year‚Äôs second quarter, saying it expects revenue of $2.27 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Analysts had forecast $2.16 billion in fiscal third-quarter sales.

Rivian Rules Out Battery Fault,https://insideevs.com/news/725586/rivian-amazon-electric-vans-fire-houston-heat/,2024-07-04 13:02,2024-07-04 13:06,RIVN,{'AMZN': {'score': -1}},"Electric vehicle fires are rare, but they quickly make headlines due to the new technology and ongoing public education about EV safety. A recent incident that caught our attention involved three Rivian Amazon Electric Delivery Vans (EDVs) bursting into flames at an Amazon fulfillment center in Houston, Texas, this week. For starters, Amazon is using thousands of EDVs made by Rivian to cut its emissions. The fleet is quickly expanding and they're already all over the U.S. The footage of the EDVs catching fire was captured by drone operator Third Coast Drone on July 1 and first reported by Gizmodo.   Get Fully Charged   Fire safety in EVs.  EV batteries have several built-in safeguards to avoid fires, like insulators and flame-retardant additives. Most certified batteries that major automakers use undergo severe thermal stress tests. But that doesn't mean things can't go wrong. Irregular charging, extreme heat and damage to battery packs can all cause fires.    In the video above, you can see a large parking lot with tens of EDVs and some are plugged in for charging. The maximum temperature that day had reached almost 100 degrees Fahrenheit as the scorching summer heat wave continues to affect several U.S. states. The drone operator saw plumes of toxic black smoke rising towards the sky from one Rivian EDV first and then the fire spread to two other EDVs parked adjacent. ‚ÄúWe are aware of the incident and are investigating the situation,‚Äù a Rivian spokesperson told InsideEVs. ‚ÄúThere were no injuries. As we are gathering information, it‚Äôs too soon to say what might have caused this thermal event.‚Äù ""We‚Äôre grateful no one was injured and are thankful for the Houston Fire Department‚Äôs rapid response,"" Amazon said in a statement. ""We‚Äôre working with a third-party investigator and experts from Rivian to investigate and are not going to speculate, so we won‚Äôt be sharing additional details until we‚Äôre confident in the facts.""

Some immediate safety precautions have also been taken at the site. The chargers connected to the damaged circuit panel board have all been turned off. Amazon electrical engineers and a high-voltage specialist determined that the rest of the chargers at the site were safe to use.¬† Studies have shown that EVs catch fire a lot less compared to combustion engine vehicles. In the rare instances when they do, the fires are dramatic and excruciatingly difficult to douse. That‚Äôs in part because the lithium-ion battery is extremely flammable. ‚ÄúThere were a few vehicles impacted by the incident, but the thermal event propagated from the source to surrounding vehicles,‚Äù Rivian said. ‚ÄúThis vehicle was plugged into the charger, but it was not charging when the incident occurred. The HV battery was not the initiator of the incident,‚Äù the spokesperson added.             In the video above, you can see firefighters struggling to extinguish the flames, but it continues to rage on, showcasing the challenges first responders face due to thermal runaway‚Äîa phenomenon where lithium-ion battery cells enter an uncontrollable, self-heating and oxygen-creating state and the pack continues to reignite until there's nothing left to burn. Modern-day lithium-ion batteries have come a long way in terms of fire safety. The U.S. doesn‚Äôt seem to have a repository of EV-related fire incidents, but Norway found that ICE-powered vehicles are four to five times more likely to catch fires. Another study in Sweden found that all non-EV fuel types produced 68 fires per 100,000 vehicles compared to 3.8 fires per 100,000 vehicles for EVs. That doesn't mean things can't go terribly wrong. Using non-certified batteries, irregular charging patterns, damage to the battery pack and extreme heat have all been linked to fires in EVs.

The world's largest cryptocurrency fell 5% in intraday trading, before recovering back to the $58K level. BTC is currently trading at $58.2K as at 1:21 pm ET.

Moreover, over the long term, it has performed quite admirably on a total return basis, virtually matching the S&P 500 until recently, where the boom in the ""Magnificent 7"" fueled by the AI bonanza has pushed the S&P above SCHD's total return performance. Data by YCharts Still, its total returns outperform many of its dividend growth peers, and anyone who bought it and held it for many years has done quite well, especially given the nice income they receive alongside it. This makes it a great fit for retirees who want to live off dividends, but also still generate very respectable long-term total returns. Moreover, SCHD has a tremendous long-term dividend growth track record, having grown its dividend every year for 12 years in a row, boasting a 10-year dividend growth rate of 11% and a five-year dividend CAGR of nearly 13%. Finally, with the S&P 500 looking overvalued by virtually every metric right now, thanks in large part to the rich valuations of some of its largest mega-cap holdings, SCHD looks like a bargain by comparison. SCHD ETF Warning That being said, it's not all sunshine and rainbows for SCHD right now, and investors need to have realistic expectations for the fund moving forward. First and foremost, with inflation moderating but still remaining quite sticky and the Federal Reserve continually stating that it is in no rush to cut rates, investors in SCHD should operate on the assumption that interest rates will remain higher for longer. This will likely pose a headwind for the dividend stocks SCHD focuses on, since many of them are viewed as bond proxies due to their high and stable yields. This, in turn, will likely weigh on price appreciation as well moving forward. Additionally, SCHD has very little AI exposure as it has no major AI companies in its top ten holdings and has quite low technology exposure overall. This means that if AI continues to dominate markets moving forward, SCHD will very likely continue to lag from a total return perspective. Additionally, with tensions soaring between North Korea and South Korea, the threat of China invading Taiwan growing seemingly by the day, and Russia and Iran remaining actively engaged in conflicts in their respective regions, geopolitical risks are a major concern. Given that SCHD invests primarily in large American multinational corporations with very low exposure to precious metals, with only 1.8% exposure to basic materials, it has considerable risks if a war should break out, though perhaps its 3.97% position in Lockheed Martin (LMT) will help some. Additionally, there are growing signs that the economy is weakening, with unemployment rising to about 4%, consumer sentiment and spending weakening, personal and corporate debt levels soaring, and credit conditions weakening, especially in the middle market sector, as Ares Capital Corporation's (ARCC) CEO recently warned, and with the yield curve remaining sharply inverted, an economic downturn will still likely hit all stocks, including SCHD's holdings. This is especially true given that about 40% of its portfolio is invested in consumer and industrial stocks. Finally, investors should note that while its long-term dividend growth history is strong, recently its dividend growth rate has slowed somewhat, with its three-year dividend CAGR being 9% and its trailing 12-month dividend CAGR being 8.86%. While this is still well above the rate of inflation and combines nicely with its 3.7% trailing 12-month dividend yield to provide a compelling case for double-digit annualized total returns moving forward, it's important to keep in mind that many of its top holdings are increasingly becoming slower-growing, mature stalwarts that will likely see their dividend growth rates slow moving forward. For example, Verizon (VZ) is one of its top 10 holdings, occupying nearly 4% of its portfolio, and it's not likely to grow its dividend at much more than a 1-2% annualized rate for the foreseeable future. United Parcel Service (UPS) is another dividend stalwart stock that has seen its dividend growth rate slow considerably over the past few years, with its three-year dividend CAGR being a whopping 17%, but its trailing 12-month dividend CAGR being a mere 5%. Its forward dividend per share growth outlook is an even more meager 2.35%. Coca-Cola (KO) is another top holding that has an impressive long-term dividend growth track record, but is likely to grow its dividend at less than 5% moving forward. Additionally, two of its top holdings, AbbVie (ABBV) and Amgen (AMGN), are both pharmaceutical stocks with inherently speculative business models due to the sensitivity of their dividend growth to their pipelines. Moreover, AbbVie is expected by analysts to grow at a sub-5% annualized rate moving forward. As a result, it would not surprise us to see SCHD's overall dividend growth rate continue to decelerate into the mid-single digits moving forward, despite posting double-digit annualized dividend growth in its history. Investor Takeaway The takeaway from this is that we continue to like Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF√¢¬Ñ¬¢ as a diversified passive income snowball for investors with a long time horizon who are not concerned about chasing the AI hype. It combines a solid current dividend yield with what is likely to be inflation-beating dividend growth for years to come.  However, investors in SCHD should do so with eyes wide open and realize that it could very well be a while before they enjoy any material total returns from stock price appreciation. They should also realize that they remain significantly exposed to geopolitical and macroeconomic risks while holding SCHD. Finally, they should not expect the fund to continue generating double-digit annualized dividend growth, though they should remain confident that it will continue to generate inflation-beating dividend growth for years to come.

(Netflix )Social SharingIt's a good time to be an Eddie Murphy fan.¬† After stepping out of the spotlight for a few years, Murphy is back and reengaging with the culture.¬†There's a new Shrek¬†sequel on the way and talk of a Donkey-focused film.¬† In 2019, Murphy returned with the riotous Dolemite is My Name.¬†He's also begun revisiting some of his greatest hits, first with Coming to America 2 and now Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.¬†In a recent interview with the New York Times, a reflective Eddie Murphy mused about the kind of movies he wants to make:¬†""I want to do something I know works and something that I know I can be funny doing.""¬†Whether at 21, the age when he filmed the first¬†Beverly Hills Cop, or now in his sixties, Eddie Murphy is effortlessly funny. There's looseness, a comfort on camera, and ease with improv other comedians can only envy.Indeed, many of the funny throwaway lines in the new film were improvised, such as when Murphy is being put into a tiny police car and quips, ""Y'all are the Lego cops.""¬†This is the Eddie Murphy who wowed audiences back in '84 as¬† Axel Foley, the fast-talking detective from Detroit who caused chaos wherever he went.¬†The first two films were a smash.¬† Murphy himself in the Times interview admits the third outing ""didn't come out good.""¬† Now reunited with producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the movie mogul responsible for Top Gun, Bad Boys, and Armageddon, Murphy felt he had a winning formula for a fourth installment.The fourth film in the franchise contains a few new faces.  From left to right Taylour Paige as Jane, Axel Foley's daughter, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Detective Bobby Abbott. (Melinda Sue Gordon/Netflix )Throwback tunes and story¬†That formula that turns out to be a heady mix of vehicular mayhem and familiar faces.¬†Watch the opening sequence set in Detroit with Foley driving a garbage truck and Bob Segers' Shakedown blaring in the background and you could be forgiven for thinking it's an outtake from the first film. Add in the Pointer Sisters, Don Henley, and the endless earworm of the original Axel F tune and the only missing from the soundtrack is a yellow Sony Walkman to play it on.After the opening in Detroit (and a warm welcome glimpse of Paul Reiser as the deputy police chief) Foley is drawn back to Los Angeles due to a case his former partner Billy is working. The return of Judge Reinhold is just the beginning of a cavalcade of returning characters.¬†There's the eternally grumpy John Ashton as Chief John Taggart, and what would a Beverly Hills Cop film be with the amusingly ambiguous accent of Serge played by Bronson Pinchot?¬†Like Murphy, Pichot is evidently enjoying himself. If you're watching on Netflix, keep your eyes out for a fun mirror moment at 49.10, as Serge adds a little flourish as he exits the room.¬†Evidently you can't make a Beverly Hills Cop without Serge. Bronson Pichot and his remarkable accent return for the new film.

(Andrew Cooper/Netflix)Sofa cinema¬†While¬†Eddie Murphy's own daughter Bria Murphy appears in a¬†minor role¬†as an arresting officer, it's the addition of Taylour Paige as Jane, Axel Foley's estranged daughter that adds a much-need level of, if not maturity, at least introspection to the story.¬†After walking out on his family,¬†Axel's relationship with¬†Jane¬†is on rocky ground.¬†With Jane also involved in the case as a¬†lawyer, Paige adds a¬†feisty presence as an actor who can hold her own with motormouth Murphy.¬†Considering the success of Bad Boys: Ride or Die, another aging action franchise that struck a chord with audiences, it might seem a missed opportunity that Axel F bypassed the movie mutliplex to premiere on Netflix.But¬†by relying on calcified callbacks and the familar Axel Foley shtick, Murphy is playing it safe and going for the easy laughs.

AAMwVSYW9ETkIgK,USA Today,bing,2024 MLB Draft: Full first round predictions starting with Cleveland at No. 1,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2024/07/04/mlb-mock-draft-roundup-first-round-predictions/74294246007/,2024-07-04 14:45,2024-07-04 14:54,ARM,,"The 2024 Men's College World Series is in the books after Tennessee's run to its first title in program history. But many of the stars in that tournament won't have to wait long for the next step in their baseball careers.The 2024 MLB Draft kicks off on Sunday, July 14. More than 600 total selections will be made spanning 20 rounds from Cowtown Coliseum in Fort Worth, Texas. For the first time in franchise history, the Cleveland Guardians hold the No. 1 overall selection. Rounding out the top five are the Cincinnati Reds, Colorado Rockies, Oakland Athletics, and Chicago White Sox.Last year, LSU standouts Paul Skenes and Dylan Crews were expected to go at the top of the draft. They did with Skenes going No. 1 overall to the Pittsburgh Pirates and Crews going No. 2 to the Washington Nationals. This year there's less of an outright consensus. Here's what experts at USA Today, Bleacher Report, MLB.com, and CBS Sports predict will happen in the first round:2024 MLB Draft mock draft roundup1. Cleveland GuardiansUSA Today: Travis Bazzana, 2B, Oregon StateBleacher Report: JJ Wetherholt, 2B/SS, West VirginiaMLB.com: Travis Bazzana, 2B, Oregon StateCBS Sports: JJ Wetherholt, 2B/SS, West VirginiaBazzana, a native of Sydney, Australia, would be the second Oregon State player taken No. 1 overall in the MLB Draft following Baltimore Orioles' Adley Rutschman in 2019. Bazzana was the top hitter on the Beavers' Pac-12 winning squad this season, leading the team in batting average (0.407), on-base percentage (0.568), and slugging (0.911).Follow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.Wetherholt is arguably the best hitter in the class but missed significant time with a hamstring strain. Last season, he posted just a 10% miss rate in a full season of action.USA Today: ""There‚Äôs nearly a whole month to adjust your dart tosses as teams juggle slot money and bonus pools. But Bazzana, a 21-year-old Aussie who batted .407 with 28 home runs last year, can move quickly to Cleveland and bring a near plug-and-play dynamic to their current group.""CBS Sports: ""We're going to say Wetherholt sneaks in as the No. 1 pick. He was viewed as a No. 1 pick candidate entering the spring, before a hamstring strain sidelined him about six weeks. The money matters as much as the talent. The Guards have a competitive-balance pick (No. 36) and any bonus pool money they save here can be spent on a high-end talent later.""2. Cincinnati RedsUSA Today: Charlie Condon, 3B, GeorgiaBleacher Report: Charlie Condon, 3B, GeorgiaMLB.com: Jac Caglianone, 1B/RHP, FloridaCBS Sports: Charlie Condon, 3B, GeorgiaNearly consensus across the board for Cincinnati here. Condon won the 2024 Golden Spikes Award given to the best amateur baseball player in the country. He was one of the top hitters in the country at Georgia this past year and led the NCAA in batting average (0.433) and home runs (37).Caglianone was electric in the College World Series and racked up 68 home runs in the last two seasons and was second to Condon in the NCAA this season with 35. He won the John Olerud Award as the best hitter/pitcher in college baseball but might not pitch in the majors.USA Today: ""Sometimes a player fits snugly in a spot and that seems like Condon‚Äôs deal here, regardless of the chaos before and after this pick. Eight years after using the second overall pick on Nick Senzel, another versatile player with power from an SEC school, the Reds opt for Condon‚Äôs record-setting 37-home run pop.""MLB.com: ""The Reds likely are focusing on [Bazzana, Wetherholt, Condon, Caglianone, Wake Forest right-hander Chase Burns, and Arkansas left-hander Hagen Smith]. Caglianone appears to be ahead of Condon, with Burns the choice if they want a pitcher.""3. Colorado RockiesUSA Today: Chase Burns, RHP, Wake ForestBleacher Report: Chase Burns, RHP, Wake ForestMLB.com: Charlie Condon, OF/3B, GeorgiaCBS Sports: Chase Burns, RHP, Wake ForestAnother near-consensus at No. 3 overall here. Burns pitched the fifth-most innings in the country (100) this season and posted a 2.70 ERA, 14th in the country. He relied heavily on his fastball and slider to rack up 191 strikeouts. Condon drops no lower than third in this roundup.USA Today: ""Perhaps spending top 10 draft capital on right-handed college pitchers named Chase is the cure for Coors Field pitching woes.""MLB.com: ""Though there has been talk of the Rockies targeting a pitcher (likely Burns over Smith), they wouldn't pass on Condon and probably not on Caglianone.""4. Oakland AthleticsUSA Today: Jac Caglianone, 1B/RHP, FloridaBleacher Report: Travis Bazzana, 2B, Oregon StateMLB.com: Braden Montgomery, RF, Texas A&MCBS Sports: Travis Bazzana, 2B, Oregon StateA mix of prospects at No. 4 for Oakland. Caglianone and Bazzana are reliable bats, as is Montgomery. The Aggie hitter ended prior to the College World Series because of a broken ankle. Concerns about the injury and his recovery could drop him out of the top five picks.USA Today: ""If A‚Äôs owner John Fisher is excited about famous opposing players like Aaron Judge coming to play in their temporary Sacramento digs, Caglianone, a two-way player, might give Sacto-A‚Äôs fans a hometown guy to rally around. While Caglianone may very well be strictly a hitter in the pros, that‚Äôs more than enough.""Bleacher Report: ""A year after taking Grand Canyon shortstop Jacob Wilson with the No. 6 overall pick, the Athletics find the other piece of their future double play combination in this hypothetical and add another elite pure hitter to the system.""5. Chicago White SoxUSA Today: Hagen Smith, LHP, ArkansasBleacher Report: Jac Caglianone, 1B/RHP, FloridaMLB.com: Konnor Griffin, OF/INF, Jackson Prep (Miss.)CBS Sports: Jac Caglianone, 1B/RHP, FloridaFor Chicago, Smith was one of the top pitchers in the NCAA last season. His 161 strikeouts were second only to Burns but he led the country with 17.25 strikeouts per nine innings. Griffin is one of the top prep players in the class and won Gatorade National High School Player of the Year. He boasts a 6-foot-4 frame and a rounded set of skills.USA Today: ""What to get the franchise that needs everything? The entire prep draft class and a handful of very enticing college position players are available here, but Chicago opts for the sure thing in Smith.""CBS Sports: ""Will the team that drafts Calgianone let him continue as a two-way player? There's some thought he'll really blossom as a hitter once he gives up pitching, and we are talking about the guy with the most power in the draft class. Caglianone has legitimate pro potential on the mound, but he might just be a reliever in the long run. Is the juice worth the squeeze?""6. Kansas City RoyalsUSA Today: Nick Kurtz, 1B, Wake ForestBleacher Report: Hagen Smith, LHP, ArkansasMLB.com: Hagen Smith, LHP, ArkansasCBS Sports: Hagen Smith, LHP, ArkansasA mix of prospects for Kansas City at No. 6 overall. Smith is one of the top pitchers on the board. Kurtz dealt with a rotator cuff injury to start the season but still finished the year eighth in the NCAA in on-base percentage (0.531) with 78 walks, the most in the country.USA Today: ""While an early-season rotator cuff injury slowed some of his momentum, Kurtz still slugged 22 home runs and got on base at a .531 clip, drawing 78 walks to 42 strikeouts in 260 plate appearances. Probably the safest but not sexiest pick at this juncture.""Bleacher Report: ""With the exception of Bobby Witt Jr., the Royals have done a much better job developing pitching talent in recent years. And if Chase Burns is the No. 1 pitcher in this draft class, then Hagen Smith is ""1A"" and not far behind.""7. St. Louis CardinalsUSA Today: Braden Montgomery, RF, Texas A&MBleacher Report: Nick Kurtz, 1B, Wake ForestMLB.com: Chase Burns, RHP, Wake ForestCBS Sports: Bryce Rainer, SS, Westlake HS (California)St. Louis is the first pick to see four different prospects in this mock draft. The only new name is Rainer who is close with Griffin as one of the top high school talents in the draft. The 6-foot-3 shortstop was one of the top players at the National High School Invitational this spring.USA Today: ""Another two-way player who leans strongly toward hitting, Montgomery is a dynamic defensive right fielder who hit 26 home runs but needs to improve on strike-zone recognition.""CBS Sports: ""It has been almost 30 years since the Cardinals drafted this high -- their last top-seven pick was in 1998 (J.D. Drew at No. 5) -- and this pick is when we could see the first high schooler taken. Rainer is loaded with tools and upside, and he gives off some Gunnar Henderson and Corey Seager vibes back when they were draft prospects.""8. Los Angeles AngelsUSA Today: JJ Wetherholt, 2B/SS, West VirginiaBleacher Report: Bryce Rainer, SS, Westlake HS (California)MLB.com: JJ Wetherholt, 2B/SS, West VirginiaCBS Sports: Trey Yesavage, RHP, East CarolinaWetherholt falls no farther than No. 8 across these mock drafts. Rainer is the top high schooler in another mock drafts as well. Yesavage suffered a punctured lung this season that kept him out of the ACC tournament but he ranked third in ERA (2.02) and fifth in strikeouts (145) in the country this season.USA Today: ""Perhaps the most fluid prospect in the first 10 picks, Wetherholt could land anywhere in the top or bottom of that range; ultimately, he lands with a franchise that adds another quick-to-the-majors talent in the footsteps of Nolan Schanuel and Zach Neto.""CBS Sports: ""History says the first player to reach the big leagues from this draft class will be an Angel. That was the case in 2021 (Chase Silseth), 2022 (Zach Neto), and 2023 (Nolan Schanuel). Yesavage missed the ACC tournament with a punctured lung a few weeks ago, but he returned looking like himself, and that's a quick-moving starter with stuff and pedigree.""9. Pittsburgh PiratesUSA Today: Konnor Griffin, OF/INF, Jackson Prep (Miss.)Bleacher Report: James Tibbs III, RF, Florida StateMLB.com: James Tibbs III, RF, Florida StateCBS Sports: James Tibbs III, RF, Florida StateA new prospect enters the roundup at No. 9 for Pittsburgh. Tibbs III is right behind Caglianone and Condon as far as power hitters in the class. He finished the season with 28 home runs, tied for seventh-most in the country.USA Today: ""Finally, the run of college players ends with a talent who will play somewhere up the middle as a pro, with speed his most devastating tool. LSU commit and the Gatorade National Player of the Year.""MLB.com: ""If one of the eight players projected above gets to No. 9, the Pirates could pounce. They're probably the second team, after the White Sox, that would pop Griffin. Barring one of those guys remaining on the board, Pittsburgh could pivot to a below-slot deal with someone like Tibbs or [Christian] Moore. Don't rule out Kurtz.""10. Washington NationalsUSA Today: Bryce Rainer, SS, Westlake HS (California)Bleacher Report: Konnor Griffin, OF/INF, Jackson Prep (Miss.)MLB.com: Bryce Rainer, SS, Westlake HS (California)CBS Sports: Braden Montgomery, RF, Texas A&MIt's all about hitting for the Nationals. Prep standouts Rainer and Griffin have the tools to develop while Montgomery brings a lot of upside if healthy at this point.USA Today: ""We try not to force comps too much, but Rainer profiles similarly to Padres rookie Jackson Merrill with his 6-3, 195-pound frame, power and arm. The former pitcher is likely to stick at shortstop, though.""Bleacher Report: ""The 2024 Gatorade National High School Player of the year, Griffin already looks the part of a big leaguer with a 6'4"", 215-pound frame and a well-rounded skill set that includes 50-hit, 60-power and 65-speed tools... The Nationals generally prioritize upside over polish at the top of their draft classes, and they are in a good spot at No. 10 to scoop up whoever slides from the top tier of players.""11. Detroit TigersUSA Today: Cam Caminiti, LHP, Saguaro HS (Ariz.)Bleacher Report: Braden Montgomery, RF, Texas A&MMLB.com: Nick Kurtz, 1B, Wake ForestCBS Sports: Cam Caminiti, LHP, Saguaro HS (Ariz.)Montgomery makes it no farther than No. 11 across these mock drafts. Caminiti was projected to be one of the top players in the 2025 class but re-classified to 2024 and is arguably the top prep pitching prospect. He already has high-90 speed with his fastball and could develop his curve, slider, and changeup to pro levels.USA Today: ""The cousin of former NL MVP Ken Caminiti, Cam is a powerful lefty with a fastball that‚Äôs touched 96 mph. Struck out 119 in 52 2/3 innings and batted .493. Has committed to LSU.""MLB.com: ""Kurtz has no obvious home in the top 10 selections and could be a steal here, the scary recent track record of college first baseman in the upper half of the first round nothwithstanding. The Tigers could take anyone else from the consensus top 10 who slips.""12. Boston Red SoxUSA Today: Christian Moore, 2B, TennesseeBleacher Report: Trey Yesavage, RHP, East CarolinaMLB.com: Christian Moore, 2B, TennesseeCBS Sports: Konnor Griffin, OF/INF, Jackson Prep (Miss.)Moore was one of the top hitters for the Volunteers this season and led the country in hits (111) and finished third in home runs (34) behind Condon and Caglianone. He played well on the big stage, too, with a home run in game three of the College World Series. Griffin falls no farther than No. 12 across this roundup and Yesavage offers another arm to the Red Sox.USA Today: ""Broke the Vols‚Äô career home run record by slugging 60 longballs, including 33 this season for the national champions, and became just the third player in SEC history to win the Triple Crown.""Bleacher Report: ""The Red Sox have not always had the best luck developing pitching prospects, so that makes a polished, high-floor arm like Yesavage an attractive target. The 20-year-old is essentially a plug-and-play future rotation piece, even if his ceiling is more middle-of-the-rotation than future ace.""13. San Francisco GiantsUSA Today: Vance Honeycutt, OF, North CarolinaBleacher Report: Cam Caminiti, LHP, Saguaro HS (Ariz.)MLB.com: Cam Caminiti, LHP, Saguaro HS (Ariz.)CBS Sports: Christian Moore, 2B, TennesseeFour different options for San Francisco here. There's the prep pitcher with tools (Caminiti), the safe hitter (Kurtz), and the College World Series standout (Moore). Honeycutt is arguably the best defensive player in the draft with Golden Glove potential. He posted career-highs in batting average (0.318), slugging (0.714), and home runs (28) in 2024.USA Today: ""A Giants draftee (20th round, 2021), Honeycutt instead became a Tar Heel walk-off king, lifting them to the College World Series while slugging 28 home runs and 65 in three years. The Giants will spend a much higher pick on him this time.""CBS Sports: ""The Giants lean heavily on analytical models to make decisions, including on draft day, and Moore has put up premium exit velocities throughout his time with the Volunteers. He may not be a second baseman long-term, but just about everyone believe he's going to hit and hit a lot.""14. Chicago CubsUSA Today: Trey Yesavage, RHP, East CarolinaBleacher Report: Christian Moore, 2B, TennesseeMLB.com: Trey Yesavage, RHP, East CarolinaCBS Sports: Nick Kurtz, 1B, Wake ForestAnother mix of Kurtz and Moore here as well as the productive Yesavage for Chicago.USA Today: ""He‚Äôs the third-best pitching prospect behind Burns and Smith, but Yesavage is hardly a consolation prize, especially for a pitching-needy organization like the Cubs. A 6-4 lefty with a fastball that touches 98 mph and offers the promise of a quick move through the organization.""CBS Sports: ""The track record of college first basemen taken in the first round is awful (C.J. Cron is the last to have a decent career), plus Kurtz missed time with a shoulder injury this year. Those factors conspire to push him down into the middle of the first round. The Cubs seem like a fine landing spot.""15. Seattle MarinersUSA Today: James Tibbs III, RF, Florida StateBleacher Report: Theo Gillen, SS, Westlake High School (TX)MLB.com: Jurrangelo Cijntje, RHP/LHP, Mississippi StateCBS Sports: Ryan Waldschmidt, OF, KentuckyFour different options for Seattle at No. 15. Tibbs III offers the best power outside of Condon and Caglianone. Seattle's picked prep players in the first round in recent years and Gillen fits the bill. He rebounded from two injury-riddled seasons with a standout senior year that showed off his impressive athleticism and power from the plate.Cijntje is the best pitcher on the board at this point with Caminiti and Yesavage off the board. Waldschmidt's exit velocity is outstanding and if he continues to improve off of ACL surgery he could have a future as a centerfielder.USA Today: ""The ACC player of the year, Tibbs slugged 28 homers in 66 games for the Seminoles. A solid bat but some defensive limitations that might confine him to left field or first base.""CBS Sports: ""The Mariners traded their competitive-balance pick (No. 68) to the White Sox for Gregory Santos (competitive-balance picks are the only picks that can be traded), so they get fewer bites at the apple this year. That could lean them to a 'safer' pick and college hitters with premium data are as safe as it gets.""16. Miami MarlinsUSA Today: Cam Smith, 3B, Florida StateBleacher Report: Ryan Waldschmidt, OF, KentuckyMLB.com: Cam Smith, 3B, Florida StateCBS Sports: Vance Honeycutt, OF, North CarolinaCam Smith was another Men's College World Series star with two-run homers to sweep the Seminoles through regional play. He improved at the plate and at third base as a sophomore this season. Waldschmidt could improve with more time from the ACL surgery while Honeycutt is already a standout centerfielder on defense.USA Today: ""It‚Äôs back-to-back Seminoles as the Marlins snag Smith, who posted a .488 OBP and 16 homers and moves well with a 225-pound frame that suggests more power is in the offing.""Bleacher Report: ""The Marlins are desperate for impact offensive talent, and Waldschmidt has the tools to be just that with elite exit velocity numbers and a polished, all-fields approach at the plate.""17. Milwaukee BrewersUSA Today: Carson Benge, OF, Oklahoma StateBleacher Report: Cam Smith, 3B, Florida StateMLB.com: Seaver King, 3B/OF, Wake ForestCBS Sports: Seaver King, 3B/OF, Wake ForestBenge is versatile at the plate and on defense; he was a semifinalst for the John Olerud Award this year (won by Caglianone). He boasts a combination of top exit velocities and bat-to-ball skills. King may end up at shortstop initially but he could develop at multiple spots on defense. At the plate, he needs to improve his discipline but racked up 78 hits this season.USA Today: ""Another two-way talent who underwent Tommy John surgery in 2022 and now profiles as a outfielder with elite exit velocity. Brewers have had success with collegiate outfielders Garrett Mitchell (UCLA) and Sal Frelick (Boston College), and Benge gives them another solid and projectable option with loud skills.""CBS Sports: ""King fits Milwaukee's M.O. as a player with power who might be a swing tweak or two away from fully unlocking it. He played at least 10 games at three different positions this spring (shortstop, third base, center field) and has a chance to play third or center at the next level. Pop and defensive versatility is up the Brewers' alley.""18. Tampa Bay RaysUSA Today: Tommy White, 3B, LSUBleacher Report: Carson Benge, OF, Oklahoma StateMLB.com: Ryan Waldschmidt, OF, KentuckyCBS Sports: Kellen Lindsey, SS, Hardee HS (Florida)White's been a powerful hitter from the plate since his prep days. He was tied for 16th in home runs (24) and tied for 22nd in hits (92) in the country this season. Neither Waldschmidt nor Benge can match his power. Lindsey is a top-tier athlete who lacks hit power at this point but makes up for it with strike zone awareness and decision making.USA Today: ""A star at both N.C. State and LSU, his elite power should transfer well to the bigs. Can play either corner spot and it‚Äôs easy to envision the Rays deploying him at both.""Bleacher Report: ""[Benge] is a legitimate five-tool talent as a position player with a 55-hit, 55-power offensive profile and a strong arm that plays well in right field, though he is also quick enough to potentially get some run in center field. The Rays tend to target standout tools and figure out how they fit when the time comes, and Benge could prove to be a great value at this spot.""19. New York MetsUSA Today: Jurrangelo Cijntje, RHP/LHP, Mississippi StateBleacher Report: Vance Honeycutt, OF, North CarolinaMLB.com: Carson Benge, OF, Oklahoma StateCBS Sports: Carson Benge, OF, Oklahoma StateThree familiar prospects are all options at No. 19 for the Mets: the ambidextrous Cijntje, defensive standout Honeycutt, and Benge's two-way potential.USA Today: ""Will Steve Cohen pay the ambidextrous pitcher two paychecks if he makes the majors as a right-handed starter and lefty reliever? The possibilities are intriguing, but it‚Äôs from the right side where Cijintje touches 97 and sits 95 with the fastball, complemented by solid secondary offerings.""Bleacher Report: ""Honeycutt would be a Top-10 pick if not for some swing-and-miss concerns, as he struck out 83 times in 62 games this spring... [he] profiles as a potential Gold Glove center fielder. So, even if he never hits for a high average, he provides enough secondary value to make a huge impact at the next level.""20. Toronto Blue JaysUSA Today: Seaver King, SS, Wake ForestBleacher Report: Tommy White, 3B, LSUMLB.com: Walker Janek, C, Sam HoustonCBS Sports: Brody Brecht, RHP, IowaKing brings consistent hitting and White offers power for the Blue Jays. Janek is the second non-Power 5 college prospect in this roundup. The Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year runs better than your typical catcher and is a threat to steal bases. Brecht pitched just 78.1 innings for Iowa this year but racked up 128 strikeouts, putting him fifth in the country in strikeouts per nine innings (14.71).USA Today: ""Quite a ride from Wingate College to Winston-Salem to Ontario. King can play all over the infield and while he lacks Bazzana and Wetherholt‚Äôs elite speed-power combo, he offers plug-and-play lineup reliability for a franchise that may be taking some hits on the dirt.""MLB.com: ""With impressive bat speed and good strength, Janek creates plus raw power that translates into average game pop with most of his home runs driven to his pull side. While he's an aggressive right-handed hitter who looks to launch balls and frequently chases pitches out of the strike zone, he's showing more patience and doing a better job of using the entire field in 2024.""21. Minnesota TwinsUSA Today: Billy Amick, 3B, TennesseeBleacher Report: Seaver King, SS, Wake ForestMLB.com: Vance Honeycutt, OF, North CarolinaCBS Sports: Walker Janek, C, Sam HoustonKing and Honeycutt fall no further than Minnesota at No. 21 overall in this roundup. Amick was part of the NCAA's best offense last season and finished tied for second on the Volunteers with 23 home runs. That raw power will likely translate to the majors but he'll need to develop more consistency.USA Today: ""Not a ton of upside but also just tapping into it after transferring from Clemson to Knoxville, where he hit 23 homers for the national champs. Twins can work to reverse his plate discipline ‚Äì he had 53 strikeouts to 29 walks this season.""CBS Sports: ""This draft class has four college catchers who could hear their names called within the first 40 picks. Depending who you ask, Janek is the best of the bunch thanks to his power, his strong arm, and his good receiving chops. The Twins are not the easiest team to pin down leading up to the draft because the current front office regime has shown a willingness to do anything.""22. Baltimore OriolesUSA Today: Ryan Waldschmidt, OF, KentuckyBleacher Report: Billy Amick, 3B, TennesseeMLB.com: Brody Brecht, RHP, IowaCBS Sports: Cam Smith, 3B, Florida StateA mix of production from the plate and the mound here for Baltimore. Smith and Waldschmidt both fall no further than No. 22 overall in this roundup.USA Today: ""Can Mike Elias shake his obsession with college outfielders? We say not yet. Waldschmidt is rising quickly after a prep and collegiate career marred by injury, but his elite exit velocity, chase rate and potential to play center field will be too tough to pass up.""MLB.com: ""When he's on, Brecht's fastball and slider are comparable to those of Paul Skenes, the No. 1 pick in last year's draft. He can sit at 96-99 mph and touch 101 with his heater, which has explosive running action and superior shape to Skenes' fastball, though Brecht doesn't locate his nearly as well. All that said, his best pitch is a slider that parks at 87-89 mph and peaks at 91 with plenty of horizontal and vertical action.""23. Los Angeles DodgersUSA Today: Kash Mayfield, LHP, Elk City HS (Okla.)Bleacher Report: Kash Mayfield, LHP, Elk City HS (Okla.)MLB.com: William Schmidt, RHP, Catholic HS (Baton Rouge, La.)CBS Sports: Jurrangelo Cijntje, RHP/LHP, Mississippi StateA consensus on the position but not the player here. Mayfield is one of the top lefties in the draft with a fastball in the high 90s and arguably the best changeup in the class. Schmidt's curveball is the best and his fastball is top tier among the prep pitchers in the class.USA Today: ""The 6-4 19-year-old has touched 97 mph with his fastball. The Dodgers and other late-round clubs may need to get creative with their bonus pool to lure the top prep lefty away from Oklahoma State.""MLB.com: ""Not only does Schmidt have some of the best stuff in the Draft, but he also generates it with ease and fills the strike zone. He still has room to add more strength to his wiry 6-foot-4 frame, so he could get better. He used to elicit comparisons to three-time All-Star Adam Wainwright, but now he's better at the same stage of his career.""24. Atlanta BravesUSA Today: Brody Brecht, RHP, IowaBleacher Report: Jurrangelo Cijntje, RHP/LHP, Mississippi StateMLB.com: Braylon Doughty, RHP, Chaparral HS (Temecula, Calif.)CBS Sports: William Schmidt, RHP, Catholic HS (Baton Rouge, La.)Another spot with a consensus on pitching. Brecht brings efficiency, Cijntje brings switch-pitching possibilities, and Schmidt's a high-ceiling prospect. Doughty makes up for his lack of size (6-foot-1) with a strong, athletic frame that translates to a commanding fastball, strong curveball, and solid slider.USA Today: ""Let‚Äôs make it five years in a row the Braves take a pitcher in the first round, four of them collegians. Atlanta will need to improve Brecht‚Äôs command but they have a 6-4, 235-pound frame to work with.""MLB.com: ""Doughty‚Äôs athleticism helps him find the strike zone very consistently, especially given his power repertoire. Those who were around him at the Area Code Games also saw plus makeup, a kid who was a sponge for pitching knowledge, something he would take to Oklahoma State should the Draft not go his way.""25. San Diego PadresUSA Today: Dakota Jordan, OF, Mississippi StateBleacher Report: William Schmidt, RHP, Catholic HS (Baton Rouge, La.)MLB.com: Kash Mayfield, LHP, Elk City HS (Okla.)CBS Sports: Kash Mayfield, LHP, Elk City HS (Okla.)Mayfield doesn't make it out of the top 25 in this roundup and Schmidt brings a pair of strong pitches already. Jordan's the lone outfielder here with arguably the top bat speed in the class. His strength with that swing bodes well for the majors but will need to improve his plate discipline.USA Today: ""It‚Äôs been eight years since the Padres have taken a collegiate player with their first pick ‚Äì but they also don‚Äôt typically draft 25th, this position partly a punishment for grossly exceeding the luxury tax. But Jordan is no low-upside safety pick. He has power to all fields, elite exit velocity and arm strength from right field.""Bleacher Report: ""The Padres are one of the few teams that have not shied away from high school pitching in the first round, and that could be to their benefit this year as there's a good chance one of the consensus top three‚ÄîCam Caminiti, Kash Mayfield and William Schmidt‚Äîwill still be on the board at No. 25 overall.""26. New York YankeesUSA Today: Kaelen Culpepper, SS, Kansas StateBleacher Report: Dakota Jordan, OF, Mississippi StateMLB.com: Tommy White, 3B, Louisiana StateCBS Sports: Braylon Doughty, RHP, Chaparral HS (Temecula, Calif.)A mix of prospects for the Yankees here. Culpepper is good but not great for now at the plate and may need to transition to third base in the majors.USA Today: ""A consummate glue guy on the left side of the infield, Culpepper has both pop and speed, neither elite but also an excellent package for this end of the first round. With Anthony Volpe entrenched, the hot corner would be calling Culpepper.""CBS Sports: ""New York hasn't taken a pitcher in the first round since Clarke Schmidt in 2017, but this would be a good year to break the trend given who's available in our mock draft. The toolsy exit velocity guys they typically target are mostly off the board and Doughty offers some of the best data in the draft class (spin rates, etc.).""27. Philadelphia PhilliesUSA Today: Caleb Lomavita, C, CalBleacher Report: Kellen Lindsey, SS, Hardee HS (Florida)MLB.com: Ryan Sloan, RHP, York HS (Elmhurst, Ill.)CBS Sports: Slade Caldwell, OF, Valley View HS (Arizona)Four different prospects at four different positions for Philadelphia. Lomavita's one of the top catchers whose swing is unusual but effective. He's improved his bat potential in his collegiate career. Sloan has a very good fastball and a surprisingly advanced changeup for a prep pitcher. Caldwell lacks size (5 feet, 9 inches tall) but makes up for it with bat speed, aggression, and athleticism to hang in at centerfield.USA Today: ""One of two Bay Area backstops who could go in the first round ‚Äì along with Stanford‚Äôs Malcolm Moore ‚Äì Lomavita brings a polished offensive profile but also questions about his receiving ability that may suggest a move to the infield.""CBS Sports: ""A year ago, the Phillies landed the steal of the draft in Aidan Miller at No. 27. Miller and Caldwell are not all that similar -- Miller is a power threat likely to settle in at third base, Caldwell is a slash-and-dash burner -- but the Phillies have really leaned into the high school ranks the last few years, and Caldwell is the highest-upside high school position player still available in our mock draft.""28. Houston AstrosUSA Today: Walker Janek, C, Sam HoustonBleacher Report: Brody Brecht, RHP, IowaMLB.com: Theo Gillen, SS, Westlake High School (TX)CBS Sports: Billy Amick, 3B, TennesseeA bunch of familiar prospects here as Brecht makes it into the first round of all four mocks.USA Today: ""They head north just a bit to pluck a collegian who could go higher in the first round thanks to solid receiving skills and 17-homer, 1.185 OPS production in the AAC.""MLB.com: ""Gillen may have the best bat of any high schooler in this Draft. He has a disciplined approach, quick hands and a sweet left-handed swing that combine to produce line drives to all fields. His hitting ability will allow him to get to most of his plus raw power, giving him a 20-homer floor, and he should develop more pop as he adds more strength to his physical 6-foot-2 frame..""29.

Compared to Janek, his bat is more productive but his glove isn't, giving a consideration to a potential position change.USA Today: ""Caldwell stands just 5-9, and though the Diamondbacks wouldn‚Äôt be be getting a power hitter, his high-energy approach, speed and hit tool would play well in both their lineup and ballpark.""MLB.com: ""[Moore]'s shown he can have an advanced approach at the plate, including doing damage with two strikes, though he wore out catching every day in his first year of college. While his surface numbers were down for much of his sophomore season, he still had elite chase rates and swing-and-miss rates in the zone. If teams think he can be an average catcher, he could easily be considered a top 10 pick.""30.

The Rangers may prefer Stanford's Malcolm Moore, another catcher with a chance to be selected earlier than No. 30.

tQcjIA8YbKzHvl6,USA Today,bing,"Magomed Ankalaev: UFC champ Alex Pereira 'overrated,' can't move to heavyweight before facing me",https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2024/07/ufc-news-magomed-ankalaev-alex-pereira-overrated-striking-cant-move-heavyweight-before-title-defense,2024-07-04 15:43,2024-07-04 15:47,V,,"Magomed Ankalaev refuses to accept the notion UFC champion Alex Pereira has cleaned out the light heavyweight division.Pereira (11-2 MMA, 8-1 UFC) registered his second consecutive title defense this past Saturday with a second-round TKO of Jiri Prochazka in the UFC 303 main event. Afterward, there‚Äôs been discussion about ‚ÄúPoatan‚Äù moving up to the heavyweight division to pursue a historic third divisional title under the UFC banner, but Ankalaev (19-1-1 MMA, 10-1-1 UFC) isn‚Äôt having it.With a 12-fight unbeaten streak at 205 pounds, Ankalaev, No. 3 in the latest USA TODAY Sports/MMA Junkie light heavyweight rankings, is the only highly-ranked fighter left in the weight class who No. 1 Pereira hasn‚Äôt beat.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a good run so far in UFC, 12 fights, and obviously Alex Pereira got up there ‚Äì he had two, three fights (in the division) and he skyrocketed,‚Äù Ankalaev told MMA Junkie through an interpreter on Wednesday. ‚ÄúNow he holds the title and now I feel I deserve with all my past credentials to get a title shot. I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to this opportunity now.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why people are saying he‚Äôs going to move up to the actual heavyweight division. I don‚Äôt see that. As a guy who has no wrestling I think it‚Äôs going to be really hard for him. Maybe just one fight. But I think once he came up to light heavyweight, he went through the division, but I‚Äôm still there. He didn‚Äôt fight me. If you want to be the champion of the division I think he definitely has to face me first. Then maybe he can consider other moves.‚ÄùOn paper, Ankalaev, 32, is arguably the worst matchup in the division for Pereira, 36. The Brazilian is a decorated and dangerous striker with a perceived weakness on the ground, while Ankalaev has proven to be highly competent both on the feet and the ground.With so much attention paid to Pereira‚Äôs recent success, pitting him against Ankalaev is a risky bit of matchmaking, especially if the current champion were to be exposed on the ground.However, Ankalaev‚Äôs social media posts in the aftermath of UFC 303 have explicitly stated he thinks he would win a striking-only affair. He stood behind that notion, though admitted he‚Äôs also aware his advantage in grappling situations would be significant.‚ÄúWith Alex you just have to watch a couple of his past fights: With (Jan) Blachowicz, his wrestling was on the level and Alex didn‚Äôt have much to offer. Same with (Israel) Adesanya. They‚Äôre both strikers, but Adesanya was able to show him some wrestling,‚Äù ankalaev said. ‚ÄúI think he is a great striker, but he is the kind of guy that always moves forward, and that‚Äôs sometimes where he might make mistakes, where I might catch him. There is strategy we have if he‚Äôs going to be doing striking. But also, if we add wrestling here, I think he doesn‚Äôt stand a chance and I have a few potential options how to finish him.‚ÄúHe definitely has a strong punch, but overall his standup is overrated. Watch his fight with Jamahal Hill. He had something to offer to counter him. Same in the fight with Prochazka. You could see he is also moving forward with the same style. He was lucky he didn‚Äôt face serious opposition. Wrestling is there, but I‚Äôm ready to fight with him standing up, to test him out.‚ÄùAnkalaev said he would be ready to accept a title shot with Pereira at any point. He rejected the rumor spread by former champ Hill that he is unable to competed in the United States due to visa issues, but said he his ideal situation would be to book it for UFC 308 on Oct. 26 in Abu Dhabi.‚ÄúAs of now we don‚Äôt have any certain dates set,‚Äù Ankalaev said. ‚ÄúI do not have any problems with visa right now. I have a valid visa, so if it‚Äôs going to be (in the U.S.) that‚Äôs one option. I would love it to be in Abu Dhabi, that‚Äôs a better place for me.‚ÄùUFC CEO Dana White was open to the idea of Pereira vs. Ankalaev when proposed with the matchup at the UFC 303 post-fight news conference. Pereira also said he will fight ‚Äúwhoever‚Äù the UFC wants him to compete against next.""ANYBODY""Champ Alex Pereira won't shy away from Magomed Ankalaev ‚Äì¬†or anyone else¬†‚Äì after #UFC303. pic.twitter.com/rT7x9XQgSq‚Äî MMA Junkie (@MMAJunkie) June 30, 2024Ankalaev is optimistic he will get the call sooner than later, and when he does, he will be prepared to maximize his moment.‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to be the next one for the title shot because if you look at the top five, everyone had a loss recently, and just logically I‚Äôm going to be stepping up and having this title fight next,‚Äù Ankalaev said. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to light heavyweight, I put a lot of hard work here. I have a stellar record. He moved up to our division. He got lucky. He had a good run, but it‚Äôs just fair that he has to face me.‚ÄúWe have to settle this with him. It‚Äôs going to be a great fight.

Key Takeaways from the Thyroid Eye Disease Market Report According to DelveInsight‚Äôs analysis, the market size of thyroid eye disease in the 7MM was found to be around USD 2.5 billion in 2023.According to DelveInsight‚Äôs analysis in 2023, the US accounted for ~40% of the total prevalent cases of thyroid eye disease in the 7MM.Prominent companies working in the domain of thyroid eye disease, including Viridian Therapeutics, Roche, Immunovant, Amgen, Sling Therapeutics, Inc., ACELYRIN Inc., Tourmaline Bio, Inc., Lassen Therapeutics Inc., and others, are actively working on innovative drugs for thyroid eye disease. These novel thyroid eye disease therapies are anticipated to enter the thyroid eye disease market in the forecast period and are expected to change the market.Some of the key therapies for thyroid eye disease treatment include VRDN-001, ENSPRYNG (satralizumab), Batoclimab, Teprotumumab, Linsitinib, Lonigutamab, TOUR006 - 20, LASN01, and others.¬†In January 2024, a New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted for TEPEZZA in Japan based on the results from the OPTIC-J study evaluating TEPEZZA in patients with active TED.In October 2023, Amgen announced that it had completed its acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. Discover which therapies are expected to grab the thyroid eye disease market share @ Thyroid Eye Disease Market Report Thyroid Eye Disease Overview Thyroid eye disease is an autoimmune condition often associated with hyperthyroidism, particularly Graves' disease. The immune system mistakenly attacks the muscles and fatty tissues around the eyes, leading to inflammation and swelling. The primary cause of TED is the production of autoantibodies that target the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which is also expressed in the tissues around the eyes. This immune response results in characteristic symptoms such as bulging eyes (proptosis), eye redness, swelling, pain, double vision (diplopia), and, in severe cases, vision loss due to optic nerve compression. The diagnosis of thyroid eye disease involves a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and laboratory tests. Ophthalmologists and endocrinologists often work together to assess the extent of eye involvement and thyroid function. Physical examination includes a detailed assessment of eye movements, eyelid position, and visual acuity. Imaging studies, such as orbital ultrasound, CT scans, or MRI, can reveal the degree of tissue inflammation and muscle enlargement. Blood tests are crucial to measure thyroid hormone levels (T3, T4, and TSH) and to detect the presence of specific autoantibodies, such as thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb). Early diagnosis and intervention are essential to manage symptoms, prevent complications, and improve the quality of life for individuals with thyroid eye disease. Treatment options may include corticosteroids, orbital radiotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, and, in advanced cases, surgical intervention.  Thyroid Eye Disease Epidemiology Segmentation The thyroid eye disease epidemiology section provides insights into the historical and current thyroid eye disease patient pool and forecasted trends for the 7MM. It helps recognize the causes of current and forecasted patient trends by exploring numerous studies and views of key opinion leaders.

While managing hyperthyroidism is crucial, it does not alleviate symptoms of thyroid eye disease. Some individuals with moderate-to-severe thyroid eye disease may eventually need surgery. Surgery is also required for those with severe cases. It is generally advised to delay surgery until the active phase of the disease has subsided. Doctors aim to manage the symptoms as effectively as possible and then proceed with surgery once the inflammation and swelling have decreased. However, if a patient's vision is threatened by the disease progression, surgery may be necessary during the active phase. The treatments for managing thyroid eye disease include glucocorticoids, mycophenolate, rituximab, tocilizumab, teprotumumab, cyclosporine/mTOR inhibitors, along with several other therapies. Until today, only one drug, developed by Horizon Therapeutics (now acquired by Amgen), has been approved by the FDA in 2020 for treating adults with thyroid eye disease. This drug, TEPEZZA (teprotumumab), is an insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor inhibitor (IGF-1R). It is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-DG44) cells, with a molecular weight of approximately 148 kD. TEPEZZA is provided as a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white lyophilized powder for IV infusions. In January 2024, the company announced it had filed for approval in Japan, with an expected launch by 2025, and plans to file in the EMA and the UK in the first half of 2024. Learn more about the FDA-approved drugs for thyroid eye disease @ Drugs for Thyroid Eye Disease Treatment¬† Thyroid Eye Disease Emerging Drugs and Companies Some of the drugs in the pipeline include VRDN-001 (Viridian Therapeutics), ENSPRYNG (Roche), Batoclimab (Immunovant), and others. VRDN-001 is a unique monoclonal antibody that targets the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), a well-established target for treating thyroid eye disease. Two critical Phase III clinical trials, named THRIVE and THRIVE-2, are currently enrolling patients with active and chronic TED, respectively. The preliminary data for THRIVE is anticipated mid-year, while results for THRIVE-2 are expected by the end of the year. Additionally, the company is developing VRDN-003, designed for subcutaneous administration, and plans to launch a global pivotal program for VRDN-003 mid-year. This program will include trials for both active and chronic TED patients, pending regulatory approval. Immunovant‚Äôs batoclimab is a groundbreaking, fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Both nonclinical studies and clinical trials have shown that batoclimab can lower IgG antibody levels. Elevated levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies are responsible for many autoimmune diseases, making this candidate a promising treatment for various IgG-mediated autoimmune conditions as a self-administered subcutaneous injection. Top-line results from the Phase III clinical trial for thyroid eye disease are expected in the first half of 2025. The other therapies in the pipeline for thyroid eye disease treatment include Teprotumumab: AmgenLinsitinib: Sling Therapeutics, Inc.Lonigutamab: ACELYRIN Inc.TOUR006 - 20: Tourmaline Bio, Inc.LASN01: Lassen Therapeutics Inc. The anticipated launch of these emerging therapies are poised to transform the thyroid eye disease market landscape in the coming years. As these cutting-edge therapies continue to mature and gain regulatory approval, they are expected to reshape the thyroid eye disease market landscape, offering new standards of care and unlocking opportunities for medical innovation and economic growth. To know more about Thyroid Eye Disease clinical trials, visit @ Thyroid Eye Disease Treatment Drugs¬† Thyroid Eye Disease Market Dynamics The thyroid eye disease market dynamics are anticipated to change in the coming years. Recent efforts to increase patient and clinician awareness of thyroid eye disease, through various awareness campaigns and a collaboration between the American Thyroid Association and the European Thyroid Association, have resulted in a comprehensive clinical guide based on the latest evidence and experience from renowned experts. This guide covers the multidisciplinary care of thyroid eye disease, which is practical, timely, and highly relevant to specialists worldwide, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis and treatment.¬† Additionally, the lack of availability of disease-modifying treatments for chronic patients significantly impacts their emotional and social well-being, highlighting the importance of designing effective molecules with appropriate delivery modes as a necessary first step in ocular drug discovery programs. Furthermore, many potential therapies are being investigated for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, and it is safe to predict that the treatment space will significantly impact the thyroid eye disease market during the forecast period. Moreover, the anticipated introduction of emerging therapies with improved efficacy and a further improvement in the diagnosis rate are expected to drive the growth of the thyroid eye disease market in the 7MM. However, several factors may impede the growth of the thyroid eye disease market. Lack of understanding regarding the disease progression, leading to lack of clarity regarding the durability of response and frequency of relapse, combined with the characteristic inflammation associated with thyroid eye disease impacting the ocular muscles and resulting in diplopia and detrimental effects on daily activities such as reading and driving, presents a critical challenge in drug development due to the inherent small patient population of this rare disease, and new therapeutics discovery and development for ocular diseases have been traditionally associated with a low probability of technical and regulatory success. Moreover, thyroid eye disease treatment poses a significant economic burden and disrupts patients‚Äô overall well-being and QOL. Furthermore, the thyroid eye disease market growth may be offset by failures and discontinuation of emerging therapies, unaffordable pricing, market access and reimbursement issues, and a shortage of healthcare specialists. In addition, the undiagnosed, unreported cases and the unawareness about the disease may also impact the thyroid eye disease market growth.

Learn how to copy them.Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR)Stock price today: ~$26A risky buy, not because of concerns about future growth, but because shares have already risen by 30% since January after posting impressive 2023 Q4 and 2024 Q1 earnings reports and a net profit for the sixth straight quarter in May.AI technology continues to grow without an end in sight, and some notable investors have taken note of Palantir‚Äôs expansion into both government contracts and the corporate sector. Cathie Wood recently added more Palantir stock to her ARK Investment Management portfolio, and the company is working on software capabilities with the U.S. Special Operations Command. Shares have been stuck in the $20-$25 range but are currently trading slightly above that.Pfizer (NYSE: PFE)Stock price today: ~$28A stock that has declined over the past year is big pharma company Pfizer, whose revenue and profits have taken a hit due to a drop in demand for its COVID-19 vaccines. But the company is too established and should steadily rebound despite forthcoming patent expirations for some of its top-selling products.The Motley Fool has been pushing Pfizer for some months now, citing the company‚Äôs dedication to launching new products, growing its dividend (currently sitting at 6.6%), and adding business development deals that could add $25 billion to its annual revenue by 2030.Marathon Digital Holdings Inc.

The Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner has aggressive expansion plans that are supported by solid fundamentals.Story continuesMarathon Digital closed the first quarter with a cash cushion of $1.6 billion (including digital assets), paving the way for aggressive growth and diversification, like its recent Kaspa mining venture. At just over $21 per share, MARA stock seems inexpensive, given the growth prospects.Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F)Stock price today: ~$13Why on Earth would you invest in one of the old-school auto companies that is delaying production of some of its planned electric vehicle models and has seen its stock drop 16% over the past year? As InvestorPlace mentions, Ford is cheap (around $13 a share), currently trades at only 13 times future earnings estimates, and pays a dividend of 15 cents per share.The company will eventually adapt to EV production concerns while continuing to produce models that never go out of style, such as the F-150 pickup and Mustang.Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: VKTX)Stock price today: ~$51Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: VKTX) is a biopharmaceutical business that creates treatments for people with endocrine and metabolic ailments. According to Insider Monkey, the company‚Äôs share price has gained 146% in the last 52 months, yet it still typically trades below $50 (however, today, it‚Äôs slightly above $51), making it a winner for healthcare companies to buy.Viking Therapeutics shares have risen since the company published forward-looking findings from its Phase 2 clinical study of VK2735, a weight-loss medicine. Although it recorded a net loss of $27.4 million in Q1 2024 (a $0.26 loss per share of $0.26), VKTX attributed the negative returns to an increase in R&D.DraftKings¬†(NASDAQ: DKNG)Stock price today: ~$37.70Even the biggest hermits will concede that sports betting is everywhere. Since sports gambling was legalized in 2018, 38 states (plus Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico), have legalized the activity.

E2G1vrb8qlMH9p0,Yahoo Finance,bing,A Deal at Last: Assessing the Future for ‚ÄòSaks Global‚Äô,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deal-last-assessing-future-saks-202000489.html,2024-07-04 16:23,2024-07-04 16:39,AMZN,,"What‚Äôs next for ‚ÄúSaks Global?‚ÄùThat‚Äôs the new entity being formed through the definitive $2.65 billion agreement for Saks owner HBC to buy the Neiman Marcus Group, which is pending approval by the Federal Trade Commission and which came to light late Wednesday.More from WWDSaks-Neiman's Merger Has Finally Arrived: What Are the Ramifications?Saks Fifth Avenue Plans 20 Stand-alone Fifth Avenue Club Locations by the End of 2024Neiman Marcus Cyber Attacker Looks to Sell Hacked Data of 'High Value Rich Targets!'Based on the $6 billion purchase price in 2013, and very recent speculation that the price tag on Neiman‚Äôs would exceed $3 billion, it appears that Saks, at the $2.65 billion price, got a good deal. Baker would not comment on that, though he has a reputation for never overspending to acquire retail.In a digital-age twist, Amazon is an investor in the deal, as is private equity giant Apollo as well as Salesforce.Richard BakerThe purchase price is expected to be funded by a combination of equity capital from new and existing shareholders and debt. Amazon will work with Saks Global to ‚Äúinnovate on behalf of customers and brand partners following the close of the transaction,‚Äù HBC said. That could involve logistical and digital upgrades.The Rh√¥ne Capital private equity firm and affiliated investment entities continue as the active lead investor in Saks Global. Global software investor Insight Partners, an investor in Saks.com, will be a shareholder in the new company. Salesforce will also become an investor at closing.In addition, HBC has secured a $1.15 billion fully committed term loan from investment funds and accounts managed by affiliates of Apollo, and a $2 billion fully committed revolving asset-based loan facility from Bank of America, the lead underwriter, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, RBC Capital Markets and Wells Fargo.‚ÄúThe transaction deleverages the combined enterprise while ensuring that Saks Global, on a pro forma basis, will have significant liquidity,‚Äù HBC said in its statement on the deal.Now that there‚Äôs an agreement, there‚Äôs lots to be taken care of, and even though the deal had been rumored for months, some aftershock is rattling employees and vendors concerned about the future. Chatter over a marriage of the New York-based Saks and Dallas-based Neiman Marcus went into overdrive when HBC bought Saks Fifth Avenue 11 years ago, and HBC chairman and chief executive officer Richard Baker instantly made no secret of the fact that he wanted to add the Neiman Marcus Group to the portfolio and create a U.S. luxury retail empire.Story continuesThe FTC is expected to make a ‚Äúsecond request‚Äù for information from Saks, which already supplied some to the government, and Saks will have to make a case for the combination, likely pressing how both brands have a greater chance of surviving, and thriving, under one corporate entity rather than as separate companies. Saks will also stress how there‚Äôs still plenty of competition in the luxury sector from multibrand websites, and luxury brands operating their own stores and websites.Internal communications will have to be stepped up to try to ease concerns over job security and potential consolidations, to try to at least keep employees focused on their jobs. With designers and brands as well, Saks needs to convey potential opportunities presented by the combined entity, and be reassuring about the future. Saks has sent letters to vendors and employees explaining the deal.Management changes are in the works. Already, Marc Metrick, currently CEO of Saks, has been named CEO of Saks Global, assuming the deal gets green-lighted by the government. Ian Putnam, president and CEO of HBC Properties and Investments, will become CEO of Saks Global Properties and Investments. Metrick and Putnam will report to Baker, who becomes executive chairman of Saks Global. It‚Äôs likely other organizational changes are contemplated but won‚Äôt be disclosed until after the deal closes.Marc Metrick will be CEO of the new Saks Global.‚ÄúI‚Äôm very excited. We‚Äôve worked on this for over a decade,‚Äù Baker told WWD on Wednesday evening, confirming earlier media reports that day about the deal. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had many discussions to buy Neiman‚Äôs at much larger numbers. It was too expensive before. It didn‚Äôt make sense. The pandemic happened. Neiman‚Äôs went bankrupt, but we finally got to a point where we were able to come to terms and do what we think is the right thing for everyone.‚ÄùWhen asked about the possibility of consolidations, Baker replied, ‚ÄúWe are not planning on closing stores, or rebranding. We are planning on using our combined resources to better serve customers, for better personalization, better functionality online, to take advantage of AI, and bring more tools to better service our customers. Neiman Marcus has a tremendous sales culture and tremendous stores with fantastic productivity. We have always admired that. So this is a great opportunity.‚ÄùBaker said he was not ready yet to discuss other management changes or structure. ‚ÄúWe will be surveying and understanding all the talent that exists in all three businesses to put together a best-in-class team,‚Äù Baker said, referring to Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks. Saks Global will thoroughly review its talent pool and create a ‚Äúbest-in-class‚Äù team going forward, he said.Baker would not comment on the future of Geoffroy van Raemdonck, CEO of the Neiman Marcus Group. There is some question whether van Raemdonck will be part of Saks Global.Saks Global, a combination of luxury-oriented retail and real estate assets, will include Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, each of which will continue to operate under their respective brands, according to HBC. Saks Global will include HBC‚Äôs U.S. real estate assets and Neiman Marcus Group‚Äôs real estate assets, creating a $7 billion portfolio of retail real estate assets in top-tier luxury shopping destinations.Also, HBC‚Äôs Canadian business, which includes TheBay.com, the Hudson‚Äôs Bay department stores, and $2 billion in real estate, will be recapitalized and stay separate from Saks Global, with ‚Äúsignificantly reduced leverage and enhanced liquidity,‚Äù the company said.A $10 Billion EntityAccording to Baker, Saks Global generates $10 billion in sales, with Saks accounting for about $6 billion in sales and Neiman‚Äôs, $4 billion. He also said that Neiman‚Äôs volume has declined from 2013, when it generated $4.9 billion in sales at the time of its $6 billion purchase by Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. In 2013, Saks Fifth Avenue generated $3 billion in volume, he said. Neiman‚Äôs went in and out of bankruptcy in 2020, through a debt-for-equity swap with Pacific Investment Management Co., or PIMCO; Davidson Kempner Capital Management, and Sixth Street.There are 39 Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 95 Saks Off 5th off-price stores. Saks.com operates as a separate business that is owned by HBC.¬†Neiman Marcus Group has 36 department stores, two Bergdorf Goodman stores and five Last Call discount stores.The buyout of Neiman‚Äôs is part of a wave of dealmaking interest in department stores, generally a beleaguered sector where investors are looking at the legacy names with new eyes. But like the deal bringing Saks and Neiman Marcus together, much depends on the ability to find investors willing to back deals. For example, Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management have been trying to buy Macy‚Äôs Inc. since last year and according to media reports, their proposed bid was just sweetened this week, building on the $6.6 billion offered in March. A source said that Arkhouse and Brigade have been looking for equity coinvestors and debt financing to firm up the offer.Meanwhile, the Nordstrom family has been in talks with private equity investors about taking Nordstrom Inc. private.Saks and Neiman‚Äôs have been in talks to merge many times over the years, but the latest negotiations began last summer.As recently as two weeks ago, sources said the price tag on Neiman‚Äôs was $3.1 billion, but at least some of the financial players around the deal were worried about the marriage of two retailers that are still looking to find their footing in a challenging retail climate.One source said Apollo wanted a coinvestor in the deal to ‚Äúreally pony up and stand side by side with them‚Äù ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the role Amazon ultimately played. Both Amazon and Salesforce have provided logistical and technology support to Saks for the last few years, according to reports.The deal would seem to give the e-commerce giant a new foothold in luxury fashion, a space that‚Äôs been hard for the ‚Äúeverything store‚Äù to navigate despite the launch of the Amazon Luxury Stores platform dedicated to high-end style. However, many observers question whether major luxury labels that sell to Saks and Neiman‚Äôs will be willing to have Amazon carry their products since they have resisted the e-tailer‚Äôs overtures for years.‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs their way to try to get into the luxury space and legitimize their entry into luxury,‚Äù the source said of Amazon‚Äôs involvement. Fashion and beauty are warming to Amazon.The Case for a DealThere‚Äôs a case for putting the two together into one group.First and foremost, millions of dollars in cost savings would be attained by centralizing and eliminating duplicative functions, such as accounting, planning, human resources, legal and distribution facilities. There could be one online buying team for both retail brands, and further consolidations and savings could involve closing some stores and reducing rents. Ultimately, the headcount could shrink by several hundred, if not by thousands.Secondly, there would be a sharing of data, best practices, management talent and a common customer base. Merging loyalty programs is a possibility. For example, using each retailer‚Äôs credit cards to shop could earn points valid at both Saks and Neiman‚Äôs. Or spending enough at either store could lead to access to invitation-only events at both Saks and Neiman‚Äôs.Third, there could be a greater differentiation between Saks and Neiman‚Äôs, and reduced overlap of merchandise, which is extensive. A former executive at Bergdorf Goodman, which NMG owns, estimated that among the true luxury brands, there‚Äôs been about 90 percent overlap. Saks already emphasizes a wider range of categories and price points and has been more aggressive online with the split of the retailer into the online operation Saks and its brick-and-mortar business Saks Fifth Avenue, while¬†Neiman‚Äôs has said it is refocusing on its wealthiest customers.Outside a Neiman Marcus store.Vendor RelationshipsThe combined entity would have greater leverage over vendors, particularly smaller ones more dependent on Saks and Neiman‚Äôs, more so than giant multinational luxury conglomerates such as LVMH Mo√´t Hennessey Louis Vuitton that are less dependent on wholesaling. At the same time, a combined entity, with a strong balance sheet, could bring greater opportunities to vendors and a willingness to test new vendors.According to the Green Street real estate research firm, there are eight malls that have both a Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus store, including the Somerset Collection in Troy, Mich.; the Fashion Show mall in Las Vegas, and Bal Harbour Shoppes in Miami. Decisions could be made on closing the weaker of the two in certain locations, benefiting the remaining store. Neiman‚Äôs generally operates larger, more productive locations with more dominant designer presentations than Saks. But Saks captures a wider spectrum of the population with its broader range of prices and offerings.‚ÄúIf Saks bought Neiman‚Äôs, they would have to more sharply differentiate,‚Äù said one luxury source, who suggested Neiman‚Äôs could focus more on high-priced designers and selling to the most affluent consumers, while Saks could double down on accessible luxury.The closing is pending approval by the Federal Trade Commission, which has grown more assertive, and the antitrust division of the Justice Department might be all over it, and possibly block it over concerns about the potential for HBC to raise prices, close stores, lay off workers and increase pressure on vendors. Recent history shows that these federal agencies have challenged transactions involving well-known businesses in other industries, such as¬†Microsoft, Meta, American Airlines and JetBlue, but also in fashion/retail, with the FTC blocking Tapestry Inc.‚Äôs¬†$8.5 billion deal to buy¬†Capri Holdings¬†‚Äî which would create an accessible handbag giant with Tapestry‚Äôs¬†Coach¬†and¬†Kate Spade¬†and Capri‚Äôs¬†Michael Kors.¬†The FTC argued that consumers will lose the benefit of head-to-head competition on price, discounts and promotions, innovation, design and marketing if the deal goes through.¬†Just this week, the FTC voted to block Tempur Sealy‚Äôs $4 billion bid to acquire Mattress Firm on grounds that the deal would suppress competition and price mattresses a lot higher.Beyond the potential of action by the FTC and Justice Department, the deal raises several other concerns.Recent history shows that retail mergers don‚Äôt always work out that well. The Macy‚Äôs Inc. takeover of May Co. in 2005 left Macy‚Äôs saddled with hundreds of weak stores, leading to mass liquidations over the years, though the deal, according to former Macy‚Äôs officials was right for the times. The Sears-Kmart merger became a slow disappearing act for both retailers, and ultimately a virtual total liquidation of both.While market experts say merging Saks and Neiman‚Äôs compounds both of their chances of long-term survival, both have been experiencing sluggish sales as consumers shift much of their spending to travel, dining out and other experiences. Whether that‚Äôs a permanent shift or not remains to be seen. Also, recently, there have been reports of Saks not paying some bills, whereas Neiman‚Äôs appears to be paying in a timely fashion. Putting together two companies sagging on the sales front doesn‚Äôt guarantee that combined entity would be stronger.When Neiman‚Äôs went bankrupt in 2020, Mudrick Capital Management, one of the lenders at the time, characterized Neiman‚Äôs and Saks as ‚Äúhighly complementary business models with significant overlap among consumers, vendors and geographic locations which provides an opportunity for significant synergies and value creation through a combination of both retailers.‚Äù But NMG quickly emerged from its Chapter 11 proceedings with new owners PIMCO, Sixth Street Partners and Davidson Kempner Capital Management, providing Neiman‚Äôs with a healthier balance sheet and a lot less debt.Michael Gould, former Bloomingdale‚Äôs chairman and CEO, has reservations about a Saks-Neiman‚Äôs combination. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see where there is any positive outcome for the customer. In certain malls where there is a Saks and a Neiman‚Äôs, you won‚Äôt need both,‚Äù said Gould. ‚ÄúIt will be a real tough thing for those vendors in the rung just below the true luxury vendors. Neiman‚Äôs together with Saks, they‚Äôre not going to be able to dictate pricing to Chanel, Vuitton or Dior,‚Äù he said, adding that several top luxury brands have been reducing their wholesale distribution, becoming less dependent on Saks and Neiman‚Äôs.‚ÄúVendors underneath that true luxury level are going to be squeezed to the ‚Äònth‚Äô degree,‚Äù Gould said, and there will be pressure exerted on vendors to sell both nameplates.If a Saks-Neiman‚Äôs deal is consummated, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll really go after the online business and explore the potential internationally,‚Äù Gould suggested. ‚ÄúThe move to acquire Neiman Marcus is unsurprising as multibrand retailers struggle,‚Äù¬†Juan Pellerano-Rend√≥n, chief marketing officer at¬†Swap, a retail technology platform that manages e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands, said in a statement. ‚ÄúRecent failures like Matchesfashion, Net-a-porter, and Farfetch‚Äôs bailout highlight the industry‚Äôs challenges. This deal aims to save Saks and Neiman Marcus from a similar fate. While skeptics cite the FTC blocking Tapestry‚Äôs acquisition of Capri, that case involved ‚Äòaccessible luxury,‚Äô which isn‚Äôt the focus here.‚Äù‚ÄúA Powerful Combination‚ÄùOne former Neiman Marcus senior official, who requested anonymity, said putting Saks and Neiman‚Äôs under the same umbrella creates ‚Äúa powerful combination as it relates to dealing with the market.‚Äù The new team, the source added, ‚Äúshould spend time understanding the culture of Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. The service level at these stores is outstanding. It‚Äôs not just about selling product.‚ÄúThere is no question that creating one set of administrative costs instead of two is a big savings and most important to focus on, though that is only a onetime gain,‚Äù the former official said. ‚ÄúThe ability to service the customer shouldn‚Äôt be overlooked. The merchandising could be centralized, but they should make sure Bergdorf Goodman remains autonomous. Bergdorf‚Äôs has the best designer presentation. It has to be very, very upscale. The challenge is how to make the stores into great emporiums where people get excited, where there‚Äôs theater, and new and interesting ideas. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs missing.‚ÄùNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, commented Wednesday, ‚ÄúNews that Saks Fifth Avenue has reached a deal to acquire Neiman Marcus comes as no great surprise as the two companies have been in discussions for some time. However, the plot twist is that Amazon will potentially take a share in the new entity ‚Äî something that adds a bit of spice to an otherwise predictable deal.‚ÄúBringing Saks and Neiman Marcus together would be something of a marriage of convenience. Both chains have struggled with growth, and both have concerns about their prospects. The rationale is that, together, they would have more financial firepower to negotiate with luxury brands and to cut out duplicative costs,‚Äù Saunders added.He also voiced some skepticism over the deal. ‚ÄúA merger does not resolve all the issues, especially those of the relevance of the chains in a market where more luxury players are pushing direct-to-consumer sales. As a larger entity, negotiating power will be a little better with the brands, but even a combined chain would not match the heft and power of the global luxury conglomerates, which would still hold most of the cards. As such, there is a risk that the deal might end up creating an even bigger headache for Saks.‚ÄúAmazon taking a stake in the business would make sense, as it has ambitions to play more heavily in the luxury space and this would give it a toehold. However, the real win here would be the ability of Amazon to streamline logistics and e-commerce, giving the new entity an advantage in a market where remote shopping has become more important to shoppers ‚Äî especially younger ones, which both chains need to do more to attract.‚ÄùOne former Bergdorf‚Äôs executive observed that luxury consumers like having options and that many shop both Saks and Neiman‚Äôs. But they‚Äôre also loyal to their personal shoppers and favorite salespeople. As the former Bergdorf‚Äôs executive said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very delicate situation dealing with the luxury customer.‚Äù¬†Best of WWDInside the Demise of Lord & Taylor¬†COVID-19 Spikes Elevate Retail ConcernsSelfridges' New Owners Bank On a Retail Renaissance in City CentersView comments",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amazon declined to comment on the planned merger.Among the country's oldest retailersHerbert Marcus Sr., his sister, Carrie Marcus Neiman, and her husband A.L. Neiman opened the retailer's first store in Dallas, Texas, in 1907. The company was sold to department store operator Broadway-Hale in 1969, setting the stage for it to expand beyond Texas. Later, Neiman Marcus came under the ownership of the conglomerate Harcourt General, which also published textbooks and owned movie theaters.In 1999, Harcourt General spun off Neiman Marcus stores and Bergdorf Goodman. Private equity firms TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus bought the company in 2005 for $5.1 billion.Today, the retailer has 36 Neiman Marcus stores in the U.S., two Bergdorf Goodman stores and five Last Call outlets. The company declared bankruptcy in May of 2020, at the time becoming one of the highest-profile retailers to collapse as the COVID-19 pandemic was shuttering retailers across the U.S.; it emerged from court supervision roughly four months later after shedding billions in debt.Story continuesSaks, based in New York City, was founded in 1924 and today has 41 stores.

If¬†the strike continues,¬†it will open 32¬†stores¬†Friday through Sunday¬†with limited hours.The corporation says its website and app will continue to accept orders for free home delivery for¬†the duration of a possible strike, but there would be ""reasonable caps"" on products both in store and online.¬†Distribution to bars and restaurants would continue, and LCBO¬†convenience outlets in smaller communities would remain open.Sales would also continue at grocery stores, private wineries, breweries¬†and distilleries, as well as bars, restaurants and The Beer Store.WATCH |¬†What you need to know about the¬†possible LCBO strike:¬†¬†Here is everything you need to know about a possible LCBO strike5 hours agoDuration 5:17The Ontario Public Service Employees Union has set a strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. Friday for its approximately 10,000 workers at the LCBO. CBC‚Äôs Mike Crawley has the latest on the negotiations. LCBO¬†stores expanded their hours in the past week, with all stores in the province opening early at 9:30 a.m. and many stores staying open until 10 p.m. The Crown corporation says it's focused on getting a deal¬†that's fair to employees but also helps it ""operate effectively and efficiently for Ontario in a new marketplace.""'Unnecessary' strike threatens summer fun: provinceA spokesperson for Ontario Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy¬†criticized the union and defended its decision to expand alcohol sales.""It's disappointing that OPSEU could be heading towards an unnecessary strike that threatens people's ability to enjoy their summers,"" Bethlenfalvy's press secretary wrote in a statement.""Ontario consumers need and deserve the same choice and convenience every other Canadian enjoys.""A customer leaves an LCBO store in Toronto on Thursday, July 4, ahead of a looming strike deadline set by the union representing LCBO workers. (Mike Crawley/CBC)Restaurant industry groups are advising their members to sign up for the LCBO's new online platform so they can continue to order alcohol for delivery during a potential strike, and to stock up.Rocco Mastrangelo¬†Jr.,¬†owner of Cafe Diplomatico¬†in Toronto's Little Italy, said the possible strike comes at a bad time, citing the ongoing Euro Cup and¬†Copa¬†America soccer tournaments.""Little Italy is always looking forward to the summer season for patio season and we're very busy,""¬†he said¬†in an interview on CBC Radio's¬†Metro Morning.""We've stocked up as much as possible. I have product even sitting at home because I don't have enough room in the restaurant to hold it.""Matt Woo, who works for a wine and spirit importer in Toronto,¬†said he was buying alcohol for himself that isn't available at grocery stores ahead of the possible strike, including vintage wines and tequila.""I'm an absolute snob when it comes to wines and, quite frankly, the selections¬†you can find at your local grocery stores¬†‚Äî I'll just drink water, thank you very much,"" Woo said in an interview outside a downtown Toronto LCBO.¬†Deal could be difficult to reach given demands: expertOver the years, unionized LCBO workers have always been able to get a deal without walking off the job, even when they've voted strongly in favour of a strike.¬†LCBO workers voted to strike in¬†2005,¬†2009,¬†2013¬†and¬†2017, yet reached agreement on a contract without a strike in every one of those rounds of bargaining.¬†Despite that¬†history of reaching deals, one expert says things could go differently this time.Rod Phillips, a wine writer and professor at Carleton University who's¬†studied the history of alcohol, said he thinks a deal might be difficult to reach due to the complexity of the union's¬†demands, which go beyond wages, benefits and working conditions.""Some of the things the union wants, like rolling back privatization, is something that the LCBO can't do,"" Phillips said.¬†""These are government decisions.""LCBO strike would be 1st in Ontario liquor store's historyLCBO expands hours before possible strikePhillips said the Ford government has shown itself to be ""very positive"" about expanding alcohol availability across the province and is unlikely to roll that back.A strike could backfire and damage the LCBO¬†because of the availability of other options, Phillips said.""One of the dangers is that if the strike goes on for very long, that people get used to going to other places, so that when the strike is over ... the business doesn't just flow back to the LCBO automatically,"" he¬†said.ABOUT THE AUTHORRyan Patrick JonesReporterRyan is a reporter with CBC Toronto.

jwU2iDrys0ZA92A,BBC,rss,Amazon at 30: What next for 'The Everything Company'?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqv5l6vnvqjo,2024-07-04 19:16,2024-07-04 19:21,AMZN,,"Three decades on from the day it began, it is hard to get your head around the scale of Amazon. Consider its vast warehouse in Dartford, on the outskirts of London. It has millions of stock items, with hundreds of thousands of them bought every day - and it takes two hours from the moment something is ordered, the company says, for it to be picked, packed and sent on its way. Now, picture that scene and multiply it by 175. That's the number of ""fulfilment centres"", as Amazon likes to call them, that it has around the world. Even if you think you can visualise that never-ending blur of parcels crisscrossing the globe, you need to remember something else: that's just a fraction of what Amazon does. It is also a major streamer and media company (Amazon Prime Video); a market leader in home camera systems (Ring) and smart speakers (Alexa) and tablets and e-readers (Kindle); it hosts and supports vast swathes of the internet (Amazon Web Services); and much more besides. ""For a long time it has been called 'The Everything Store', but I think, at this point, Amazon is sort of 'The Everything Company',"" Bloomberg's Amanda Mull tells me. ""It's so large and so omnipresent and touches so many different parts of life, that after a while, people sort of take Amazon's existence in all kinds of elements of daily life sort of as a given,"" she says. Or, as the company itself once joked, pretty much the only way you could get though a day without enriching Amazon in some way was by ""living in a cave"". So the story of Amazon, since it was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, has been one of explosive growth, and continual reinvention. There has been plenty of criticism along the way too, over ""severe"" working conditions and how much tax it pays. But the main question as it enters its fourth decade appears to be: once you are The Everything Company, what do you do next? Or as Sucharita Kodali, who analyses Amazon for research firm Forrester, puts it: ""What the heck is left?"" ""Once you're at a half a trillion dollars in revenue, which they already are, how do you continue to grow at double digits year over year?"" One option is to try to tie the threads between existing businesses: the vast amounts of shopping data Amazon has for its Prime members might help it sell adverts on its streaming service, which - like its rivals - is increasingly turning to commercials for revenue. But that only goes so far - what benefits can Kuiper, its satellite division, bring to Whole Foods, its supermarket chain? To some extent, says Sucharita Kodali, the answer is to ""keep taking swings"" at new business ventures, and not worry if they fall flat. Just this week Amazon killed a business robot line after only nine months - Ms Kodali says that it is just one of a ""whole graveyard of bad ideas"" the company tried and discarded in order to find the successful ones. But, she says, Amazon may also have to focus on something else: the increasing attention of regulators, asking difficult questions like what does it do with our data, what environmental impact is it having, and is it simply too big? All of these issues could prompt intervention ""in the same way that we rolled back the monopolies that became behemoths in the early 20th century"", Ms Kodali says. For Juozas Kaziukƒónas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, its size poses another problem: the places its Western customers live in simply can not take much more stuff. ""Our cities were not built for many more deliveries,"" he tells the BBC. That makes emerging economies like India, Mexico and Brazil important. But, Mr Kaziukƒónas, suggests, there Amazon does not just need to enter the market but to some extent to make it. ""It's crazy and maybe should not be the case - but that's a conversation for another day,"" he says. Amanda Mull points to another priority for Amazon in the years ahead: staving off competition from Chinese rivals like Temu and Shein. Amazon, she says, has ""created the spending habits"" of western consumers by acting as a trusted intermediary between them and Chinese manufacturers, and bolting on to that easy returns and lightening fast delivery. But remove that last element of the deal and you can bring prices down, as the Chinese retailers have done. ""They have said 'well, if you wait a week or 10 days for something that you're just buying on a lark, we can give it to you for almost nothing,'"" says Ms Mull - a proposition that is appealing to many people, especially during a cost of living crisis. Juozas Kaziukƒónas is not so sure - suggesting the new retailers will remain ""niche"", and it will take something much more fundamental to challenge Amazon's position. ""For as long as going shopping involves going to a search bar - Amazon has nailed that,"" he says. Thirty years ago a fledging company spotted emerging trends around internet use and realised how it could upend first retail, then much else besides. Mr Kaziukƒónas says for that to happen again will take a similar leap of imagination, perhaps around AI. ""The only threat to Amazon is something that doesn't look like Amazon,"" he says.

According to the Atlantic Council, Chinese sales of EVs abroad rose 70 percent in 2023, reaching $34.1 billion.Almost 40 percent went to the European Union, the largest recipient of Chinese EVs.The EU market share of Chinese-made EVs climbed from around three percent to more than 20 percent in the past three years, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.- Who are the key players?¬†-The overwhelming market leader from China is BYD, which this year posted record annual profits for 2023 and says it aims to be among the top five car companies in Europe.Last year, it became the first manufacturer to pass the five million milestone in terms of hybrids and all-electric vehicles produced, cumulatively -- crowning itself as ""the world's leading manufacturer of new energy vehicles"".Among the other top Chinese EV makers exporting to Europe are SAIC, MG Motor and Polestar -- owned by Volvo and its Chinese parent firm Geely -- according to state media.Story continues- Why is the EU worried?¬†-The surge in exports has allowed Chinese firms to rapidly increase their share of the EU market for EVs.The EU has now concluded that Chinese manufacturers benefited from ""unfair subsidisation, which is causing a threat of economic injury"" to European automakers.But there is also dissent within the EU -- Germany, a major trade partner whose car market is heavily reliant on China, warned tariffs would harm German companies.The EU will now impose provisional duties between 20 and 38 percent on top of the current 10 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars.Definitive duties will take effect in November for a period of five years, pending a vote by the EU's 27 states.- How has Beijing reacted? -Beijing has yet to react but a Chinese trade group condemned the bloc's ""protectionism"".China has already bared its teeth however, kickstarting an anti-dumping investigation into pork imports from the EU, threatening Spanish exports.In January, China launched an anti-dumping investigation into brandy imported from the EU, in a move seen as targeting France, which had pushed for the commission's probe.Beijing said in June it ""reserves the right"" to file a case with the World Trade Organization over the EU tariffs.- How have car manufacturers reacted? -Since the EU's move will impact all Chinese-made electric cars, Tesla's Model 3, the electric Mini, and the Volvo EX40 are also among the vehicles that will face higher duties.A Tesla spokesperson said prices for the Model 3 -- the number three in electric car sales in Europe -- should increase ""in the short term"".China's electric car makers Nio and XPeng told AFP they had no plans to quit the European market after the announcement.Meanwhile, MG France said it already imported 2,600 electric vehicles from China that have cleared customs.- What impact will the tariffs have? -Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy, alongside Austrian institutes, predicted the higher taxes will reduce vehicle imports from China by 42 percent.Electric car prices could rise by an average of 0.3 to 0.9 percent in the EU, they added.Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, said costs for Chinese exporters of EVs and EU consumers would increase, and the duties would also hit the bloc's energy conservation and green development goals.burs-oho-raz/ec",0.0,True,"China has implemented a focused industrial strategy to bolster its electric vehicle (EV) industry, injecting substantial government funding into domestic companies.

t14FflKHdGbtI37,Seeking Alpha,google,Meta Platforms Stock: Explaining The Growth Algorithm And Prospects (NASDAQ:META),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702492-meta-platforms-explaining-growth-algorithm-and-prospects,2024-07-04 23:40,2024-07-04 23:41,META,,"gorodenkoff/iStock via Getty Images Meta (NASDAQ:META) has seen its shares nearly 5x from their 2022 trough, driven by a relentless focus on efficiency, huge success in Reels, and achieving best-in-class ad targeting capabilities in a post-ATT world. Today, as Reels monetization reaches neutrality, comps begin to get tougher, and Zuckerberg directs a lot of attention and resources toward AI, investors are once again questioning the company's future. This is a good time to explain Meta's complex growth algorithm and show why it has a very bright future ahead. Introduction I've been covering Meta on Seeking Alpha since July of last year. Across four articles, I discussed Meta's year of efficiency success, the burden of the Reality Labs segment, the significant remaining upside heading into 2024, and the potential implications of a TikTok ban. I maintained a Buy rating throughout the period, which turned out to be correct: Data by YCharts With Meta hugely outperforming the rest of its big tech peers and the indices, it's reasonable to question the remaining upside. To answer, we need to start by discussing Meta's moat. Meta's Moat Post-ATT In April 2021, Apple (AAPL) released an iOS update that included the App-Tracking-Transparency or 'ATT' framework. Until then, platforms like Facebook were able to track users' actions across apps, which enabled deterministic measurement of the return on ad spend. Simply put, Meta and its advertisers knew the exact conversion rates of ads shown on Meta's platforms. Then came Apple, and under the excuse of privacy, it effectively killed thousands of applications whose business model relied on advertising, a form of monetization that was harder for Apple to collect fees from. Meta was then forced to find a new way to measure the ROAS for its customers and turned to a probabilistic model. This required billions of dollars of investment, specifically on GPUs, as Meta had to build a machine-learning algorithm to gauge the conversion rates of its ads. Aside from Alphabet's (GOOG) Google, there aren't too many companies in the world with enough resources to build a similar algorithm. As a result, both Meta's and Google's moats significantly strengthened. Not only do they have the most eyeballs and time spent on their platforms, but they are now years ahead of any alternative in terms of measurement, and targeting. This didn't only kill other ad-based applications, it also made thousands of small businesses go out of business, as it's harder to use probabilistic measures in their case. Data by YCharts It took some time, but both Meta and Google are close to beating Apple since that ATT release (and they were way ahead until the recent WWDC surge), while smaller peers like Snapchat (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) couldn't deal with the ATT implications and are still very much below their April 2021 levels. This gives us the relevant backdrop for the next section. Meta's Playbook & Reels Monetization Worries Leveraging its best-in-class advertising offering, Meta is by far the industry leader in monetizing the most popular features of 2024. This includes Stories, and of course, Reels. Ever since TikTok took the world by storm, investors were afraid that Meta would lose its dominance in the social media landscape. However, in a typical Meta way, Zuckerberg was quick enough to realize they needed to add short-form video, and engagement skyrocketed. Then, as Reels was very successful in increasing engagement, investors were worried about its dilutive effect on monetization. Every time Meta adds a new feature, it starts by making it the best possible experience and then begins incorporating ads over time. As of 2024, Reels have reached monetization neutrality, meaning Meta is essentially complacent whether a user goes through the feed, looks at Stories, or scrolls Reels. This takes us to today. Extraordinary Success Brings Along Worries About The Future All those struggles that Meta encountered, including building the post-ATT infrastructure, increased competition from TikTok, regaining profitability, and dealing with a tougher advertising market, are a story of the past. Pretty much since the second quarter of 2023, Meta had quarter after quarter of revenue growth acceleration and margin expansion: Meta Q1'24 Presentation As we can see, the upcoming second quarter will still enjoy easy comps, specifically on the margin front, but from that point on, Meta will start lapping much better quarters. Furthermore, Reels monetization reached optimization in early 2024, so it will still be a big tailwind throughout the year, but it won't have this outsized impact from 2025 and beyond. Once again, investors worry about Meta's future prospects, especially following the recent earnings call, as Meta raised both its expense and capex outlook. Meta's Increased Expense Guide & AI Investments Let's start with the profitability outlook. So far, Meta raised its expense outlook primarily due to higher legal costs, and higher infrastructure costs. This does not reflect any meaningful change in the margin outlook for the company. Investors are justifiably uncertain about Meta's path to monetize its AI efforts. However, there are several things that should be remembered. First, when it comes to the development of the Llama model, Meta is playing defense against closed AI models in hopes that they won't use their AI capabilities to (1) take away engagement from its platforms and (2) diminish the leadership of its ad platform offerings. You can easily understand that if you use closed generative AI models to generate content and/or ads, you might use Meta's platforms less. Making it open source makes sure the value remains in Meta's networks. Second, so many times in the past Meta had success with the playbook we just discussed, I see no reason to doubt Zuckerberg's ability to succeed once again. Zuckerberg is clearly happy with the 'Efficient Meta', and I can't envision him going back to the old days of reckless spending. With that, let's turn to top-line growth. The Top-Line Growth Algorithm Going Forward Finally, we reach the key issue of this article. At this point, I think we established that margins will remain somewhat stable going forward and that Meta has a huge moat when it comes to time spent on its platforms, and monetizing it. The main drivers of Meta's top-line growth are reflected in the following graph: Created by the author using data from Meta's reports. As more people become more engaged with the platforms, Meta generates more ad impressions. As the return on those ads improves, Meta charges a higher price. Importantly, another major factor that influences the price per ad is inventory. This means that if ad impressions grow it creates a downward pressure on price. The optimal period for revenue generation is when ad impressions are growing but demand is so high that price is growing too. Until now, ad impressions benefitted from Reels' ad load increasing sharply. As we progress through the quarters, this will become a less meaningful tailwind. So, what do Meta's growth prospects look like in the future? First, user growth, which remains steady in the mid-to-high single-digit range (crazy to think about as Meta now has 3.24 billion daily users). This will lead to more ad impressions. Second, ad load, as Meta continues to incorporate more ads into the platform even though most features are pretty loaded up already. Three, price per ad, as Meta continues to offer a best-in-class advertising platform for advertisers, with a constantly improving Advtange+ suite. Four, new products and features, such as Threads, which recently reached 175 million monthly actives, and Meta AI. Five, higher digital advertising budgets, as more and more spending transitions to digital, and overall advertising spending continues to grow. Six, WhatsApp Business, which continues to gain traction, as reflected by the 85% growth in non-advertising FoA revenues last quarter. Valuation & Low Consensus Estimates Considering all of the above, I find consensus estimates for 12% revenue growth in 2025 extremely low. In addition, EPS estimates reflect essentially flat margins, despite the fact that this year's margins include several one-offs, primarily regarding legal costs. With that in mind, let's take a look at Meta's current multiples: Data by YCharts At 22 times CY25 earnings, Meta is slightly above Google as the cheapest among big tech: Data by YCharts That puts Meta at a market average valuation and a convenient 1.8x PEG. In my view, considering all the growth avenues Meta has and its extremely wide moat, this valuation is too low. In my view, a 2x PEG would be fair, getting us to a price target of $574 a share, which reflects 13% upside, and a 25x P/E on CY25 earnings. In addition, I expect Meta will surpass EPS estimates by a very significant margin, but I'll leave that out of the calculation. Conclusion Meta has multiple drivers for continued mid-teens growth while at least maintaining current profitability. Consensus estimates materially underestimate the company's ability to sustain its efficiency gains, increase engagement, and continue to improve its advertising capabilities. Furthermore, those estimates don't reflect potential success in Threads, direct AI monetization, and WhatsApp business. Even if consensus estimates are correct, Meta is still undervalued, trading at a market-average low-twenties multiple. If expenses go out of hand it might create a near-term selloff, similar to what we say post-earnings, but I find that unlikely and irrelevant from a long-term perspective.  I reiterate Meta at Buy.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

6KVUcKxVeZswuWP,Seeking Alpha,bing,"Goldman Sachs BDC: Improvements, But Key Risks Remain",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702495-goldman-sachs-bdc-improvements-but-key-risks-remain,2024-07-05 00:29,2024-07-05 00:39,ARM,,"Trevor Williams I have been actively covering Goldman Sachs BDC (NYSE:NYSE:GSBD) since December last year, when I issued my initial thesis that was somewhat conservative. The issue was related to the weakening portfolio dynamics coupled with relatively marginal dividend coverage level that together outweighed the GSBD positives such as focus on well-established businesses and primarily senior secured first lien structures. After some while GSBD circulated its Q4, 2023 earnings deck, which I also assessed per a separate article. Here the new data points were not sufficient to justify a more bullish stance on GSBD as the portfolio quality continued to worsen. Furthermore, it become even more evident after the Q4 earnings release that GSBD really struggles to capitalize on its potential synergistic effects with the broader Goldman investment banking arm (i.e., the management has not managed to register surplus investment volumes over the TTM period, which is critical for BDCs to grow the NII generation). If we take a look at the total return performance of GSBD since the moment when my first piece was published, we will notice a somewhat correlated return profile with the broader BDC market. Ycharts Now, a while ago, GSBD published its Q1, 2024 earnings deck, which includes some additional insights that are worth contextualizing against the current thesis to understand whether the overall investment case of GSBD has improved. Thesis All in all, the Q1, 2024 performance of GSBD could be deemed decent and in line with how the market has priced the stock since the date of the earnings release (which is an increase of 2% in total return terms). At the same time, the results were not overly positive that would justify higher share price or a change in investment stance (to a more bullish one) on GSBD. Let me explain. The net investment income per share for the first quarter was $0.55, which implies a decrease of $0.01 per share compared to the prior quarter, which itself came in materially lower than what GSBD had achieved in Q3, 2023. The key reasons behind the continued drop in the net investment income generation was related to the top-line dynamics. During the quarter, the total investment income decreased mostly due to the accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts. On top of this, the GSBD also recorded an increase in PIK income, which is not cash like item and effectively reduces the quality of earnings. Despite the weaker results in the NII generation, GSBD has still maintained its dividend level at $0.45 per share, which after the Q1 period marks the company's 37th consecutive quarter of a $0.45 per share dividend. Yet, if we compare this dividend with GSBD's NII per share results we will arrive at a dividend coverage of ~ 120%, which indicates a reasonable margin of safety. Based on this surplus, GSBD should be able to also build up its NAV base and fund new acquisitions without relying solely on the external debt. However, during Q1, GSBD registered a minor drop in its net asset value per share of 0.5%. While the net investment income again exceeded the quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share, this surplus was neutralized by several investment write-downs (although the total non-accrual base dropped to 1.6% of the total portfolio FV). Now, if we take a look at GSBD funding volumes, which was one of my identified red-flags in the previous articles, we will observe some improvement. During Q1, 2024, GSBD originated circa $360 million in new investment commitments, which was the highest figure the BDC had achieved over the trailing twelve month period. The sales and repayment activity also came in higher than in at a relatively sizeable level of $115.7 million, but against the backdrop of growing funding volumes, the total portfolio value finally ticked higher. GSBD Investor Presentation Here it is also worth highlighting the commentary in the recent earnings call by Alex Chi √¢¬Ä¬ì Co-Chief Executive Officer - who provided a nice color on the improving funding volume outlook: Yes. Just the pipeline of new opportunities has really picked up materially, and I think it just points to the themes that we've been talking about, which is the significant amount of dry powder that private equity firms have that they will need to deploy, but also the record amount of portfolio companies that need to get sold due to the DPI pressure that firms have, especially if they want to raise their next vintage of funds. With all of this being said, my key concern still remains in place (unchanged). Although GSBD is nicely diversified across 149 portfolio companies that operate across 39 different industries, the underlying financial profiles of these businesses are just too risky. Namely, the weighted average net debt to EBITDA of these companies remained flat at 6.1x, which is a clear indicative of an elevated financial risk. Also, from the debt service cost perspective, the picture does not look that sound. The weighted average interest coverage of GSBD's investment portfolio companies did not improve either, remaining flat at 1.5x. The bottom line The recent quarterly earnings report did indeed deliver some encouraging data points about GSBD's prospects to stabilize its NII generation levels. The most important aspect is that the net funding volumes were positive allowing GSBD to organically grow its portfolio, which, in turn, should create a more favorable environment from which to increase its NII results. Furthemore, it seems now that the pipeline is also strong as implied from the management's commentary and sizeable gross originations. Having said that, the underlying portfolio quality still remains a notable concerns with the key credit metrics (e.g., net debt to EBITDA and DSCR) remaining unchanged at a levels that are clearly indicating an elevated financial risk. Yet, at the same time, GSBD trades at a premium to its NAV of ~ 8%, which, in my opinion, does not take into account the risk of incremental non-accruals that could stem from weakening economy affecting the highly leveraged portfolio companies.  As a result of these dynamics, I do not view Goldman Sachs BDC as a solid investment choice in the BDC space.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

oTCRDP96ECWkbv2,BBC,bing,Blue wall crumbles in Essex as Tories lose seven seats,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng93n0yj6o,2024-07-05 01:15,2024-07-05 01:30,F,,"The Conservatives' blue wall in Essex has crumbled during a damaging night for the party. Nigel Farage stole the headlines as he rounded off his high-profile campaign by romping home in Clacton. The Tories also surrendered seats in Harlow, Colchester and Chelmsford as the results rolled in earlier. Kemi Badenoch was elected for the party in the newly-formed North West Essex seat but said her party had lost the trust of voters. The Tories have lost seven seats so far, with three still to declare, while Labour has won five and both the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK gained one. Results in Witham and South Basildon and East Thurrock are still being counted. Mr Farage said he would be ""out and about"" in Clacton-on-Sea as he became an MP at the eighth time of asking. In a speech after the result was announced, Mr Farage said it was ""the first step of something that is going to stun all of you"". He won Reform UK's second seat of the night, overturning a Tory majority of more than 25,000 to create his own lead in excess of 8,000 votes. Labour delivered a crushing defeat for Southend Tories who lost both city seats for the first time in history. In Southend West and Leigh, former Basildon mayor David Burton-Sampson snatched the seat. And across the south Essex city, Bayo Alaba won Southend East and Rochford. In Colchester, Labour's Pam Cox became the first woman to be elected as the city's MP as she saw off competition from former Olympic gold medallist and Tory candidate James Cracknell. Chris Vince gained Harlow from the Conservatives with 16,313 votes and a majority of 2,504 ‚Äì making him the first Labour MP for the bellwether town for almost 20 years. ""What I can offer is someone who works incredibly hard and puts the people of Harlow first,"" he said. In Thurrock, there was huge disappointment for the incumbent Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price. She had a majority of 11,482 but came third in the vote, beaten to second place by Sophie Preston-Hall, of Reform. It followed Labour taking control of the financially-challenged Thurrock Council in May. The single Liberal Democrat gain came in Chelmsford, where Marie Goldman took the seat from Vicky Ford, the city's previous Tory MP. The selection of Richard Holden as the Conservatives‚Äô candidate in Basildon and Billericay certainly ruffled a few feathers. Mr Holden, who is chairman of the Tory party, had previously been the MP in North West Durham ‚Äì some 300 miles away. His arrival was described as a ""slap in the face"" by party officials in Essex before he won the seat by just 20 more votes than Labour's Alex Harrison. Conservative Kemi Badenoch won the newly-formed North West Essex seat but said her party must regroup. ""As a party the Conservatives must come back together, look deep in our political souls, and ask some uncomfortable questions,"" she said. Former Home Secretary James Cleverly held Braintree with a majority of just under 4,000. Veteran Tory MPs Sir Bernard Jenkin and Sir John Whittingdale both retained their seats in Harwich and North Essex and Maldon respectively. Alex Burghart held his position in Brentwood and Ongar for the Conservatives, as did Rebecca Harris in Castle Point and Mark Francois in Rayleigh and Wickford. And in Epping Forest, Neil Hudson successfully defended the seat vacated by his Tory predecessor Dame Eleanor Laing. By Matt Knight, BBC Essex political reporter Change came to the country and here to Essex as well. For the first time since 2005, Labour won seats here in Colchester, Harlow and Thurrock. Then, quite incredibly, the party won in both Southend West and Leigh and Southend East and Rochford ‚Äì places that have never had a Labour MP. But Labour were not the only ones celebrating on a night of drama. The Liberal Democrats won in Chelmsford and at the eighth time of asking, Nigel Farage won the support of voters in Clacton to finally make his way to Parliament as a Reform MP. The Tories held on in areas like Castle Point and Rayleigh and Wickford, but only just after the Reform vote surged.  Perhaps their night was best summed up in Basildon and Billericay where Richard Holden, the Conservative Party chairman, won by just 20 votes from his Labour challenger. He had sorted a so-called safe seat in Essex after moving from the north east, but in this general election nowhere was safe for the Conservatives as they met the anger of voters, the return of Labour and the emergence of Reform.

Shares are up more than 40% over the past 12 months, sharply outperforming the iShares Biotechnology ETF (IBB), of which AMGN is a holding. Though the $166 billion market cap biotech industry company has been a performance leader in its niche, the speculative biotech slice of the US stock market has underperformed the S&P 500. Big pharma, such as Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) seem to capture all the attention, but I see bullish fundamentals and strong technicals with AMGN that investors should consider. Amgen develops, manufactures, and markets biologic therapies for oncology, inflammation, and rare disease, and I have a buy rating on the stock. It's also making strides in the lucrative weight-loss area. Amgen Shares Sharply Outperforming IBB Stockcharts.com Back in early May, Amgen reported a strong set of quarterly results. Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $3.96 topped the Wall Street consensus forecast by a nickel while $7.45 billion of revenue, up 22% from year-ago levels, was about in-line with expectations. The management team guided FY 2024 operating EPS of $19 to $20.20 with a full-year top line of $32.5 billion to $33.8 billion, both material increases and with midpoints above consensus. Amgen's strong first quarter was driven by solid performance from its key drugs, including Repatha, Aranesp, and Epogen. Enbrel, Otezia, and Neulasta sales were not as impressive, though. Altogether, though, the Q1 numbers were met with applause from investors as shares rose 11.8% the following session - the best earnings-day performance in at least the last three years, according to data from Option Research & Technology Services (ORATS). Looking ahead to the Q2 report, the options market has priced in a 3.8% earnings-related stock price swing when analyzing the at-the-money straddle expiring soonest after the August 6 release. That's the cheapest straddle since the Q2 report last year. Slower Embrel Sales YoY Seeking Alpha It will be key to look for updates on Amgen's obesity portfolio and AMG 133 which showed promising interim phase 2 results earlier this year. All eyes are on its MariTide medication which would go up against Wegovy and Ozempic. But Lilly and Novo are tough competitors, and increasing entrants into the GLP-1 space is a key risk. Furthermore, Amgen's legacy drug portfolio could begin to weigh on sales growth in the quarters ahead. Another risk is a lack of successful product launches or disappointing clinical trial results. On earnings, analysts at BofA see operating EPS rising just 3% this year with an earnings acceleration into the out year. By 2026, per-share profits could reach $22. The current Seeking Alpha consensus numbers are slightly less sanguine, showing steadier bottom-line advances in the mid-single-digit range through 2026 while revenue is forecast to jump 17% this year. Dividends, meanwhile, are projected to increase at a 10% annual rate over the next handful of quarters, potentially resulting in a growing yield if the stock price holds where it is today. And with just a mid-teens earnings multiple and consistent free cash flow, the operational backdrop appears favorable in my view. Amgen: Earnings, Valuation, Dividend Yield, Free Cash Flow Yield Forecasts BofA Global Research I don't see Amgen as a deep-value idea or even a standout GARP play yet. Consider that its 5-year average forward non-GAAP price-to-earnings ratio is just 14.3. If we assume $20.10 of operating EPS over the coming 12 months, about where the consensus is today, and apply a 14.3 multiple, then shares should trade near $287. But I assert that a P/E closer to the sector median is appropriate given the potential of its weight-loss drug. Apply a 17x multiple, still more than four turns cheaper than that of the broader market, and the fair value is closer to $342, making the stock a buy on valuation. Amgen: Attractive on Earnings, Near-Average P/S Metrics Seeking Alpha Compared to its peers, Amgen sports a soft valuation rating but the earnings picture is attractive given where the stock trades today. While the growth trajectory has been lackluster, the firm's own earnings estimates have bumped up, potentially leading to an improved profit picture come 2025. What's more, the company's profitability metrics are compelling as it stands today despite a weak ratio of sellside EPS downgrades to upgrades in the past 90 days. Investors continue to lift AMGN stock higher, though, and the technical situation and share-price momentum trends are positive, which I will detail later. Competitor Analysis Seeking Alpha Looking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show a confirmed Q2 2024 earnings date of Tuesday, August 6 BMO with a conference call immediately after the results cross the wires. You can listen live here. No other volatility catalysts are seen on the calendar. Corporate Event Risk Calendar Wall Street Horizon The Technical Take With a decent valuation and growth prospects, AMGN's technical situation is impressive. Notice in the chart below that shares have been in a protracted uptrend going back a decade. I normally analyze price action on a three-year zoom, but prospective investors and current shareholders should appreciate the big picture here. I see support at the uptrend support line which currently resides in the $230 to $240 range. Resistance is at about $340 - above the double-top of $326 to $329 that was recently put in. But with a rising long-term 40-week moving average (comparable to a 200-day moving average), the bulls control the primary trend. Furthermore, take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph - it has been ranging in a bullish area between 40 and 80. While we could see the stock drift closer to the uptrend support line, the trend is up and shares are not overbought today. Thus, the technicals are solid today ahead of bullish July and August seasonal trends. AMGN: Bullish Long-Term Uptrend Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line  I have a buy rating on Amgen. I see this big biotech company as intriguing as it makes headway into the GLP-1 weight loss drug market. AMGN has also been a consistent long-term winner in a volatile industry as the stock's momentum remains strong.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
XPLtBDWuWEQTMhO,BBC,bing,County red as Red Wall seats return to Labour,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czq6pz26q6eo,2024-07-05 02:11,2024-07-05 02:22,F,,"Labour reversed their losses in the so-called Red Wall and and took a stranglehold of South Yorkshire as the party won every seat in the county. Rother Valley, which was won by Alexander Stafford in 2019, turned red as did Penistone and Stocksbridge, plus Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme. In Sheffield, Labour increased their majority in the marginal Hallam seat and saw off a challenge from Reform in Barnsley. Marie Tidball, who won Penistone from Tory Miriam Cates, said: ""Our community gave me so such, it will be a great privilege to use my skills and experience to give back to the place that made me."" Ms Tidball picked up 19,169 votes, giving her a majority of just under 9,000 over Ms Cates, who saw her share of the vote fall by a quarter. She thanked the NHS in her victory speech and said being elected to the seat she grew up in was ""the honour of my life"". In Rother Valley, Labour's Jake Richards narrowly eclipsed Tory Mr Stafford to record a majority of just 998. Mr Richards recorded 38.5% of the vote, which translated into 16,023 votes. Mr Stafford recorded 36.1% of votes cast which meant 15,025 ballots for him. LIVE: UK general election - latest results and updates LIVE: South Yorkshire results come in as Labour make gains A night at the counts in Sheffield and Rotherham  The winner paid tribute to Mr Stafford, saying although they ""may disagree on a lot, I never doubt that he worked incredibly hard"". Voters in what was previously Don Valley, now renamed and reshaped as Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme, dispensed with Tory Nick Fletcher. The outspoken Mr Fletcher, who during his tenure had said a female Dr Who robbed boys of a role model, came second with 12,811 votes - a decrease in share of nearly 20%. Winner Lee Pitcher polled 15,122 or 38.6% of votes cast. Following the announcement, Mr Fletcher, who had been the first Tory MP in Doncaster, warned residents to ‚Äúbe careful‚Äù of what he saw as a future of socialism across the country. In Barnsley, Labour saw off what was expected to be a stiff challenge from Reform. Polling had suggested a close race in Barnsley North and Barnsley South, but in the end it was comfortable for Labour. Dan Jarvis, who had been MP for Barnsley Central before it became Barnsley North scooped a majority of 7,811 by attracting 18,610 votes to Reform's 10,799. Posting on X, the former South Yorkshire mayor, said: ""Reports of my demise had been greatly exaggerated..."" In Barnsley South, Stephanie Peacock recorded more than 46% of the vote to poll 16,399. Reform's David White came second with 11,651. Ms Peacock said her party's win was a ""reflection of 14 years of a chaotic Conservative government"". In Sheffield Hallam, Labour's Olivia Blake secured 23,875 votes compared to challenger and city Lib Dem leader Shaffaq Mohammed's 15,686. This gave her a majority of 8,189 - up from 712 in 2019. She said her win celebrated the end of ‚Äú14 years of Conservative vandalism‚Äù. Labour cantered to victory with solid majorities across the rest of the city. In Rotherham, Sarah Champion was re-elected with a majority of about 5,500 votes over second-place Reform. Mr Miliband, who accrued 16,231 votes against the Conservative candidate in second on 7,105, said he was delighted with the picture locally and nationally. He said Labour had received an ""historic mandate"". Mr Miliband said people on the doorstep had expressed fear whether any party could ""turn the country around"". He said Labour's job was now to ""show people that they can deliver"".  Copyright 2024 BBC.

EzVMQEBwKDxxV5k,Seeking Alpha,bing,Unity Software: Painful Turnaround,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702507-unity-software-painful-turnaround,2024-07-05 02:30,2024-07-05 02:40,AAPL,,"sebastianosecondi/iStock via Getty Images Anytime a stock continues to hit new lows, an investor has to tread cautiously. Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) recently traded at all-time lows following another weak quarter in Q1, and the stock appears headed for a test of the $15.23 low on June 21. My investment thesis remains Neutral on the stock, with the new CEO only starting on May 15 due to the potential kitchen sink type quarter coming up. Source: Finviz Dumpster Fire If anyone wants a glimpse of how bad the 1H performance was for Unity Software, one only has to see how the stock was one of the worst performing stocks in the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). The ETF had a lot of dogs this year, yet Unity Software still fell into the top 5 losers with a 60% loss. Source: Seeking Alpha New CEO Matthew Bromberg comes from Electronic Arts (EA) and previously served as the COO of mobile game developer Zynga. The new CEO has still yet to place his finger on the turnaround business plans of Unity, and a lot of new CEOs like to restructure the business regardless of what an interim CEO of the quality of Jim Whitehurst has already completed. The maker of the Unity game engine is leaning into AI with the Unity 6 product set to release later this year. In addition, the company has launched and expanded on ad platforms with the integration of data from ironSource Ads, contributing to the opportunity to further monetize advertising with the Unity game engine. The company had 50% of the top Apple (AAPL) Vision Pro games made with Unity. AR/VR games are a future growth opportunity, but naturally Apple has seen limited headset sales so far due to the device costing in excess of $3,500. Executive Chairman Jim Whitehurst actually sees the biggest opportunity in the business from the Industry segment, working with corporations. Unity is working in areas from human machine interface to training and sales and marketing to bring real-time 3D to the office place. On the Q1'24 earnings call, Mr. Whitehurst made the following statement about the opportunity in the Industry segment, topping gaming as follows: Secondly, I'm not going anywhere. I'm remaining as Executive Chairman. And what I'm really excited about working on is the industry side of the business. I am obviously in an area where I've spent a lot of time and I continue to be super excited about the opportunity we have there. I'm probably biased, but I still think that's a bigger opportunity in the long run than the gaming business. Naturally, the new CEO comes from the gaming background, so the focus might entirely shift back to gaming. An investor never knows the unpredictable turns of a new CEO. Looking For The Bottom A big contributor to the lower stock price is that Unity reported a very confusing Q1 quarter and guided to similar confusing numbers for Q2. The company reported strategic sales of $426 million and guided to only $420 to $425 million in Q2, with an expected dip of 6% to 7%. The gaming software company guided to revenues of $1.8 billion for the year, which would represent minimal growth of up to 4% YoY. A lot of these sales numbers were technically below consensus, but the real confusing part is that Unity Software provides the total Q1 sales of $460 million, but the company guided to just the strategic revenue level for Q2 and full year. The company only generated $34 million in revenues from the non-strategic portfolio, which is expected to dip to below $10 million per quarter by year end. Again, corporate turnarounds are difficult due to restructuring actions like these that make comparing financials very difficult. The ultimate key is that the strategic revenues are targeted to dip during Q2. The stock continues to trend along the bottom due to the combination of weak results and a new unproven CEO. Unity Software did generate an adjusted EBITDA of $79 million in Q1, up from $29 million last year due to cost actions. The company targets Q2 adjusted EBITDA relatively flat sequentially at $75 to $80 million. The stock has a market cap of ~$7.5 billion, with diluted share count listed at 478 million shares. At the $1.8 billion revenue target, Unity trades at only 4x sales. If the company returns to 15%+ sales growth, the stock is exceptionally cheap at 4x sales targets for a high margin software business. If Unity Software meanders with lackluster growth, the stock could actually dip to a multiple of 1x to 2x sales targets. Unity is already solidly profitable, with a $300+ million adjusted EBITDA target for the year and a consensus EPS estimate of $0.82 turning into $1.05 in 2025. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that the company still has too many questions to bet on the bottom yet. Unity Software has huge potential growth in utilizing AI to build developer tools for games and industry apps, while AR/VR provide another growth opportunity.  For now, investors should continue watching from the sidelines until the new CEO outlines plans and Unity Software shows signs of the turnaround being in place.

China has become an increasingly important market for Tesla, as the country accounts for more than half of the world‚Äôs total EV sales. Last year, Tesla derived nearly a quarter of its total revenue from China.                But the US carmaker is also facing rising competition from Chinese rivals. BYD overtook Tesla in the final quarter of 2023 as the biggest seller of EVs on the planet. Tesla regained its position in the first half of this year, but they are neck and neck.                Tesla cars had previously been¬†barred from entering¬†some government and military complexes in China due to spying and data security concerns.

h4lVS2Wuc9Pmq58,Seeking Alpha,google,"Riot Platforms Stock: A Cash-Burning Machine, Even In The Crypto Bull Market (NASDAQ:RIOT)",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702509-riot-platforms-a-cash-burning-machine-even-in-the-crypto-bull-market,2024-07-05 03:01,2024-07-05 03:05,BTC,,"asbe In December of 2021, I published a bearish view regarding the blockchain mining company Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) in ""Why Riot Blockchain May Never Generate Consistent Profits."" The stock has declined by ~64% despite a significant Bitcoin rally over the past year. RIOT is also down 28% YoY despite an 86% increase in Bitcoin's value. Analyst sentiment remains very mixed, with many bullish and bearish outlooks. Given Bitcoin is back at a high level and facing some stagnation to its rally, I believe it is another excellent time to analyze Riot Platforms. The company has changed over the past two and a half years, and the cryptocurrency market has shifted even more, going through a full negative and positive cycle since. With Bitcoin at a high, we should imagine Riot's current profit level may be in the higher range of its forward potential. Thus, it may be headed for even greater financial pressures if it cannot earn a consistent profit after years of development and higher cryptocurrency prices. Further, with Bitcoin crashing by over 5% on Thursday, we must consider RIOT's exposure to a potential reversal in Bitcoin's value. Bitcoin May Have No Value in the Long Run Over a decade ago, Riot's business model likely would have sounded nonsensical to most people. The company owns massive Bitcoin ""mining"" facilities through data centers. This requires Gigawatts of power, enough energy to power hundreds of thousands of homes. Mind you, its operations are focused in Texas, which has had notorious difficulty with the ERCOT grid in recent years due to rising demand. As such, Texas has paid Riot Platforms through energy credits to avoid consuming power during peak demand periods. The company has reported this as ""providing power,"" but it is more than not using it during high-demand periods and getting paid for that. All of this power is used to make more Bitcoins. Those who have read my work know that I do not believe Bitcoin is a viable currency, given its poor transaction efficiency ""scalability problem."" What I understand is not necessarily important in the short-term, as if people believe in Bitcoin, it will have value. However, in the long run, I think it will likely be other cryptocurrencies that do not have scalability issues and extremely excessive power demand requirements that prove viable. Riot may adapt to this by shifting toward other cryptocurrencies. Of course, potentially viable alternatives like Ripple cannot be mined. I argue that ""mining"" is a crucial issue with many cryptocurrencies. Riot's servers are dedicated to solving ""complex cryptographic puzzles"" that become more difficult once Bitcoins are mined, artificially limiting supply growth. This validates transactions, but in a highly inefficient manner where the transaction ledger must be updated across a comprehensive decentralized platform of miners. Cryptocurrencies like XRP that do not use this inefficient method can do transactions in seconds (as opposed to ~30 minutes) at much lower power costs. For me, Riot Platform is far too dependent on Bitcoin, a Dinosaur in the cryptocurrency market√¢¬Ä¬îthe vast majority like Bitcoin for its speculative volatility. Most people think of Bitcoin in terms of its dollar value, directly implying that its value compared to fiat currency is more important than its value as a replacement of fiat currency. This is to say that Bitcoin has value only because people think it has value - not because it can replace fiat currency. Rising Power Retail Prices Signal Political Risk The most significant issue with its profitability is the cost of power. Including all of its facilities, its power cost was 2.6c/kWh last month. Due to seasonal fluctuations, its annual average power cost should be above that level. Its power costs are far below retail levels due to long-term power contracts and its effort to buy at low-cost periods and avoid consumption during peak demand. Since it has contracts to buy, it has earned sales by selling this pre-contracted power during expensive periods. It could be argued that its most profitable business segment is these gains from not operating. Still, there is a generally positive trend in Texas' power costs, likely partially driven by rising demand from industrial sources like Riot. See below: Data by YCharts Given Texas ' power grid issues, it is unclear if Riot will manage very low power costs indefinitely. Key figures in the Texas state government sought to survey its power consumption in an ""emergency survey."" However, Riot, with aid from the Texas Blockchain Council, blocked this through a lawsuit, leading to the destruction of all relevant data. From this, I conclude that Riot's exposure to political strains will likely grow, as people and politicians may see it as an enormous drain of scarce power that is not going to a clear economic purpose. Of course, I am confident that Riot would argue that mining Bitcoin serves some purpose, but politicians and voters struggling with rising electricity bills may disagree. Unprofitable In Good Times and Bad Most cryptocurrency-centric stocks are highly correlated to Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. RIOT has partially lost its correlation to Bitcoin, given its operating income has collapsed to terribly negative levels despite an increase in revenue. See below: Data by YCharts Critical differences exist between how YCharts accounts for Riot's operating income and how the company does. Per its annual report, we can see that it counts changes to Bitcoin's value as an operating factor, whereas such (changes to fair value) are more typically viewed as non-operating, which is how YCharts accounts. Riot's operating income is very negative, attributable to its relatively low profit margins after its power costs and other overhead. Of course, if we add back depreciation and amortization, or ""net operating income,"" we can see it closer to breakeven but still generally below that threshold. Further, by looking at the difference between its operating income and net income (per YCharts' accounting), we can see its exposure to Bitcoin's price. See below: Data by YCharts Riot Platform holds around 9.33K in BTC, which is worth around $538M at today's price. As the price of Bitcoin rose in 2023, the company reported a positive change in the fair value of Bitcoin of $184.7M (10-K pg. 42). That figure is the primary driver of its positive net income on a TTM basis. However, even if we deduct all depreciation (some of which will be realized as its assets age), the company does not earn a consistent profit on its core operations, primarily mining. The Bottom Line I am skeptical of Riot Platform's current business model. Not only is the premise of Bitcoin mining likely flawed (in my opinion), as well as the concept of Bitcoin-as-a-currency, but it has also failed to earn a positive net operating income even during a period of high Bitcoin prices. Of course, that point can be debated based on how we account for changes to Bitcoin's fair value. Its income is positive due to unrealzied gains on higher BTC prices. Now that we're seeing negative pressure in BTC, it seems that those gains could become losses. From an operational standpoint, its most profitable activity is not using the power it bought at a lower cost. That is interesting, but I do not believe it will be an avenue for long-term consistent profitability. Today, its Bitcoin production is down dramatically YoY as it continues to shift toward lower production at greater Hash Rate efficiency. While Riot's strategy has failed to earn consistent profits in a would-be-strong period, it has some value. The company owns electronic assets, some of which could theoretically be converted into a traditional data center if it shifted away from Bitcoin. The critical issue with this is that most of its computational power comes from Application-Specific Integrated Circuits instead of CPUs and GPUs. These ""ASIC"" chips are specifically designed for cryptocurrency mining and use more power to do so more efficiently. If the cryptocurrency mining market fails due to a prolonged decline in cryptocurrency prices or higher power costs, these components may be of little value. Still, Riot has no material financial debt and other valuable assets. Its tangible book value per share is $9.15, which is near its current share price of $9.6. Its cash position is historically high at $688M. That said, its value is at high dilution risk. The company is likely losing cash on an operational basis today and is instead utilizing tremendous cash from financing via very aggressive share sales. See below: Data by YCharts On a TTM basis, the company raised ~$1.09B from financing (primarily equity sales). However, its market capitalization is only $2.76B, so continued dilution at this pace could rapidly deteriorate equity holders' value. In other words, the company is raising a lot of cash from investors and has failed to show a positive ROI from these investments. While its tangible book is near its market capitalization, I estimate that its liquidation value would be below its book value as I do not believe its chips are worth what they've paid for them, given I also think the Bitcoin mining industry is inherently unsustainable. Compared to its peers, Riot does have a lower valuation based on price-to-sales and price-to-book. See below: Data by YCharts It is larger and more established within its industry but has a weakened reputation due to low returns on equity-dilutive investments. Consistently positive operating profits are unseen in the industry, so it isn't easy to distinguish between their valuations. I feel that companies can bring in a great deal of money from retail investors interested in popular trends or capitalizing on ""FOMO."" In my experience, genuinely profitable growth industries usually focus on private capital markets with access to ""smart money."" Those firms who can garner media attention with popular media buzzwords like ""Bitcoin,"" ""AI,"" and similar may find public markets a better avenue to raise capital, given institutional investors are more likely to be skeptical of its profitability potential. This is not to say that Riot or its peers are dishonest, only that retail investors should understand that companies can earn a lot of money from retail investors through equity sales if investors are willing to overlook profitability potential consistently. In my opinion, retail investors in RIOT are overlooking its failure to earn a positive income despite massive projects that have required immense equity investor capital dilution. Again, if it cannot earn a solid operating profit during high Bitcoin periods, I do not see how it can thrive in the long term. My view is based on my belief that Bitcoin's feasibility as a currency is very low. I am sure some may disagree with my opinion. However, even if we assume Bitcoin maintains the $50K to $100K range, it is unclear if Riot will see consistent positive operating cash flows. For these reasons, I am bearish on RIOT and expect it will decline due to equity dilution, negative operating income, and potentially significant losses, given recent declines in BTC-USD. That said, I would not short-sell RIOT. RIOT's short interest is 20%, giving it some risk of a positive breakout in a short squeeze. Although I am bearish on Bitcoin, it could continue to rise where Riot may temporarily see improved profits.  Lastly, and most importantly, if we assume Riot ends its equity dilution habit, its tangible net asset value may not be dramatically below its market capitalization. The company has a strong cash position and physical assets likely have some value even if it ended its mining focus. That said, I cannot provide a feasible value estimate for its physical assets because we're not seeing a positive net operating income. Still, I think RIOT is overvalued broadly due to dilutions (and generally negative returns on investment) and not necessarily due to a significant premium to its theoretical net asset value.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
vTYg2YqzEwNzfRU,BBC,bing,Pro-Gaza candidates squeeze Labour vote in Muslim areas,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9e9ydj215yo,2024-07-05 02:52,2024-07-05 03:05,F,,"Labour has lost a number of former strongholds to independent candidates campaigning on pro-Gaza platforms. In one of the biggest shocks of the night, shadow minister Jonathan Ashworth lost his Leicester South seat, which had a majority of more than 22,000.  The party's vote is down on average by 11 points in seats where more than 10% of the population identify as Muslim.  In Ilford North, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting was among those who saw his majority slashed - from more than 9,000 to 528.  But Labour managed to win back Rochdale from George Galloway.  Overall it was a spectacular night for Labour, with the party winning a landslide victory.  However, in areas with a high proportion of Muslim voters the party performed badly.  So far, Labour has lost four seats with large Muslim populations - three to independents and one to the Conservatives.  In Leicester South, Shockat Adam declared ""this is for Gaza"" as he won the seat by 979 votes.  The constituency, where around 30% of the electorate are Muslim, has been held by Mr Ashworth for 13 years.  In nearby Leicester East, the Conservatives benefitted from independent candidates picking up several thousand votes, particularly the area's former Labour MP Claudia Webbe.  Ms Webbe, who was expelled from the party after she was charged and later convicted of harassment, has been a vocal pro-Palestinian campaigner. The Tories won her former seat by 4,426 votes, less than the number secured by Ms Webbe.  Meanwhile, independent candidates who made the conflict in Gaza central to their campaign won in Dewsbury and Batley, as well as Blackburn, which both previously had healthy Labour majorities.  Other senior Labour figures in areas with large Muslim populations only narrowly held their seats after seeing their majorities eaten away.  In Ilford North, independent candidate Leanne Mohamad, who is the granddaughter of Palestinian refugees, was just 528 votes behind Mr Streeting.  In Birmingham Ladywood, shadow justice secretary Shabana Mahmood held off a challenge from independent candidate and lawyer Akhmed Yakoob, who has a large following on TikTok.  However, her majority fell from more than 32,000 to 3,421.  Similarly Jess Phillips, who quit the Labour frontbench to vote for a Gaza ceasefire in Parliament last year, also saw her majority slashed from 13,141 to just 693.  Jody McIntyre, who stood for Mr Galloway's Workers Party of Britain, came second.  Ms Phillips faced shouts and booing as she gave her speech after the result, describing the campaign as ""the worst election I have ever stood in"" and claiming her activists had faced intimidation and violence.  In Bethnal Green and Stepney, in east London, shadow small business minister Rushnara Ali, who was defending a majority of more than 31,000, beat independent candidate Ajmal Masroor by just 1,689 votes.  At his own count, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer faced heckles of ""Free Palestine"" and saw his majority cut, with pro-Gaza independent Andrew Feinsten coming second with 7,312 votes.  In Islington North, his predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn retained his seat as an independent, after being suspended from the party over his response to a report on antisemitism in Labour.  Mr Corbyn beat the Labour candidate by more than 7,000 votes.  However, in Rochdale, Labour's Paul Waugh ousted Workers Party leader Mr Galloway, just months after he won the seat in a by-election dominated by the Gaza conflict.  Labour has faced growing pressure over its stance on the conflict, since Israel launched a military campaign in response to Hamas's unprecedented attack on 7 October. In February Labour called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza but critics said the party was too slow to reach that position.  In its manifesto, Labour has committed to recognising a Palestinian state.  Last year, Sir Keir was criticised after appearing to say Israel had the ""right"" to cut off water and energy to Gaza.  He later clarified that he meant only that the country had a right to self-defence. Copyright 2024 BBC.

ZiqMSYxheOvDD8x,Yahoo Finance,bing,Should You Buy Into Chipotle's 50-for-1 Stock Split? Maybe...,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-chipotles-50-1-stock-070400494.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,2024-07-05 03:14,2024-07-05 03:23,AAPL,,"The big news surrounding Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) lately has been its huge 50-for-1 stock split, which took effect at the opening of trading on June 26. Normally, stock splits are way smaller, like 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, so this one was an interesting development. But investors have to step back and understand what exactly is going on. On one hand, a stock split isn't as important as it sounds, but on the other, it might still be important to Wall Street.Chipotle gave shareholders 50 shares for each one they ownedThere are different ways that stock splits are managed, but the most basic concept is that the company issues its shareholders a set number of new shares for each share they own. In the case of the popular Mexican fast-casual chain, it was 50 shares for each one. So, if you owned 10 shares before the split, you own 500 shares now. That might sound like an incredible deal, but it really isn't. That's because in every split, the stock price gets adjusted proportionally. Chipotle shares began trading on June 26 at about 2% of the price they closed the session prior.CMG ChartEach shareholder still owned the same fraction of the company as before. Nothing at all really changed other than that the company now has more shares outstanding and a lower stock price.Reverse stock splits do the same thing, just in the other direction. After a reverse split, there are fewer shares outstanding and a higher stock price, which is why companies often perform that maneuver when they are at risk of being kicked off a stock exchange because their share price has dropped too low.But the concept of the reverse split helps to set up the important narrative here. If a company's stock price has dropped to the point where an exchange is threatening to delist it, there are almost always bad things happening with its business. Investors have voted with their feet and dumped the shares, and reverse splits are often followed by more selling.By contrast, when a company conducts a ""normal"" split, it's because investor sentiment about it is strong and buying has pushed the stock price up to lofty heights. Those events are often followed by continued strong buying activity because Wall Street views splits as an indicator that the business will continue to perform well. Investor sentiment is a very important driver of stock prices.Should you buy Chipotle after the stock split?From a business perspective, Chipotle Mexican Grill today is the exact same company it was before the stock split. The restaurant chain has grown rapidly, and plenty of consumers love its food. Sure, its performance has waxed and waned over time, but management has generally executed well overall.Story continuesHowever, before the 50-for-1 stock split the stock price was hugely expensive. That made it hard for smaller investors to buy. Now, even though each share represents the ownership of a smaller slice of the company, those shares are within reach of more investors. So it is possible that the stock will continue to rise as more investors can add this strongly performing company to their portfolios. In other words, the already strong base of support for the stock could broaden even further.AAPL ChartTake a look at the chart of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) above and notice all of the ""S"" flags above the price line. Those are stock splits, and you can see that the stock price just kept going higher and higher after each one. Not in a straight line, of course -- nothing on Wall Street goes up or down in a straight line. But the technology giant's splits did serve as indicators of its strong business performance, and that performance continued after them.Things don't always work out that well, but it is hard to ignore the importance of investor sentiment when it comes to stock prices. And investors tend to like stock splits.But don't take continued strong business performance for granted. True, in the first quarter of 2024, for example, sales rose an impressive 14% with same-store sales up a very respectable 7%. So right now it appears that there's no need to worry. But keep an eye on this chain to make sure that it continues to execute at a high level.Splits are all about investor sentimentAt the end of the day, the only things that have changed about Chipotle after the stock split are that there are more shares outstanding and the stock price is lower. It is still the same company and you should really only buy the stock if you like the business' fundamentals. But assuming you do like the business, the positive view that investors generally have regarding stock splits could be an additional good reason to step into this stock today.Should you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?Before you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn‚Äôt one of them.

16G7k6Ynz55syXH,Seeking Alpha,bing,There Are Better Opportunities Than One Liberty Properties,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702518-there-are-better-opportunities-than-one-liberty-properties,2024-07-05 04:09,2024-07-05 04:24,WFC,,"DNY59 Investment Thesis One Liberty Properties (NYSE:OLP) has some strong points such as:  solid business metrics high dividend yield the ongoing shift towards a more industrial-oriented portfolio  However, it also has some weaknesses that shouldn't be overlooked, such as:  low AFFO per share growth no dividend growth high AFFO payout ratio a history of poor capital allocation decisions that lead to inefficient portfolio  Considering the above factors, I believe that OLP's valuation is not justified when compared to some of its competitors. There are better alternatives within both industrial or retail-oriented property sectors, such as:  Prologis (PLD) - Prologis Is A Bargain After Its Recent Price Drop  NNN REIT (NNN) - NNN: Great Pick For Stability-Seeking Investors  Agree Realty Corporation (ADC): Elite-Level Business Metrics With Room To Further Outperform STAG Industrial (STAG): Great Business With Double-Digit Total Returns Potential   That said, I am bearish on OLP and don't consider it as a reasonable addition to my portfolio. Introduction OLP is a diversified REIT with a portfolio heavily leaning towards industrial properties (responsible for ~65.9% of contractual rental income) and retail properties (~24.4% of contractual rental income). The rest of the contractual rental income is derived from, among other things, health & fitness centers, restaurants, and theatres. Let me already establish my general view on diversified REITs. I prefer specialized REITs as they tend to outperform diversified REITs as they can focus on the sector of their core competence. For example, I consider Realty Income's (O) diversification decisions as being forced by its size and weakness rather than strength as the new property sectors (e.g. gaming properties, data centres) lie far away from its core area of competence. However, I don't intend to paint each diversification attempt with the same brush. I advocate for VICI Properties' (VICI) expansion into the non-gaming experiential property sector or EPR Properties' (EPR) portfolio reorganization to reduce the share of the theatre segment in its ABR. Therefore, each diversification strategy should be overviewed before stating an opinion. During the last three years, OLP's stock price declined by 17.8%, which is not a surprise considering the REIT sector as a whole and the headwinds accompanying the industrial property sector. However, the stock price saw some recovery YTD and marked an increase of ~6.5%. Let's examine whether OLP is worth considering as an addition to a well-structured portfolio, enjoy the read! Data by YChartsData by YCharts One Liberty Properties - Overview The Business Most of OLP's revenue is derived from the industrial property sector, which has been accompanied by headwinds related to the supply-to-demand relationship. As indicated within the Wells Fargo report:  Q1 2024 marked a 7th consecutive quarter with net completions exceeding 100m sq. ft. the net absorption declined further and reached 15.7m sq. ft. - the lowest level since 2012 as a result, the vacancy rate has increased to 6.2% - the highest level since 2015  While some of the most recognizable sector representatives, e.g., the biggest industrial REIT in the world, Prologis, expect the headwinds to continue for the upcoming quarters, there are already first signs of an upcoming improvement in market conditions. Construction starts within the industrial property sector equalled 40.8m sq. ft. in Q1 2024 (a significant decrease since the peak of ~175m sq. ft. recorded in Q3 2022). With the demand accompanied by promising value drivers (demography, growing income, e-commerce) and low construction starts influencing the future supply, a positive shift in the supply-to-demand relationship can be expected. CoStar Inc. and Wells Fargo Economics CoStar Inc. and Wells Fargo Economics Regarding the business metrics, let's start with the occupancy rate. As of March 2024, the Company held a high occupancy rate when compared to some of the most popular industrial property REITs, which amounted to 98.8%. For reference, the occupancy rate stood at:  95.5% for First Industrial (FR) 97.7% for STAG  97.7% for EastGroup Properties (EGP) 97.0% for PLD   However, one has to remember that the industrial property sector is not the only sector in which OLP is involved. The market vacancy rate for retail properties is considerably lower than the one for industrial properties, which improves OLP's score. For reference:  99.6% for ADC  99.8% average since the IPO for Essential Properties Realty Trust (EPRT) 99.4% for NNN   Moreover, it's worth emphasizing REITs with similar portfolio situations, i.e., with a majority of rental income derived from industrial properties, followed by income generated via retail/service-oriented properties:  99.1% for W. P. Carey (WPC) 99.2% for Broadstone Net Lease (BNL)  Nevertheless, looking at the investment & disposition strategy of OLP, we may assume that the Company intends to grow the significance of its industrial property segment across the whole portfolio. Also, it already contributes the majority of rental income. Looking at the weighted average lease term (WALT), OLP is capable of securing solid lease terms on its agreements as its WALT stood at 5.5 years (as of December 31, 2023). For reference, the metric has recently stood at:  12.2 for WPC 4.4 for STAG 4.2 for TRNO 8.2 for ADC 14.1 for EPRT 10.0 for NNN  #2 Capital Allocation OLP's strategy involves increasing the significance of the industrial property sector within its portfolio through industrial property acquisitions and disposals of other non-industrial properties. Each acquisition in 2022 and 2023 (with investment volumes of $56.5m and $13.4m, respectively) involved industrial property. Moreover, OLP acquired a single-tenant industrial property for $6.5m in April 2024. On the other hand, the property dispositions regarded mostly retail and restaurant properties. OLP's Investor PresentationOLP's Investor Presentation As a result, the industrial segment of OLP's portfolio continues to increase its significance in terms of the property count and the share in its rental income, which grew from 35% in 2017 to 63% in 2023. Therefore, I've mostly referred to the industry property sector representatives. OLP's Investor Presentation #3 Credit & Financial Stance As of March 2024, the Company had a well-laddered maturity schedule for the upcoming years, with annual principal payments ranging from ~5-11% of its total mortgage debt. Therefore, even prolonging the high-interest rate environment will have a limited impact on OLP's financial performance, especially given its fixed-rated debt orientation. OLP's Investor Presentation However, OLP shows significant weakness in terms of its fixed charge coverage ratio, which amounted to 1.5x as of December 2023. For reference, the above metric stood at:  7.6x for PLD 5.5x for STAG 4.7x for WPC 4.6x for BNL 4.3x for NNN 5.9x for EPRT 4.9x for ADC  During the last three years, OLP delivered a low AFFO per share growth, which amounted to 2.6%, 1.5%, and 0.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2021 - 2023, respectively. For details, please refer to the table below.   AFFO per share ($) 2020 2021 2022 2023   OLP 1.90 1.95 1.98 1.99   Click to enlarge On June 10th, 2024, OLP announced its quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share, upholding the status of an entity that increased or upheld its dividend for 126 consecutive quarters. OLP upheld or increased its dividend for over 30 consecutive years. The current dividend yield stands at a high ~7.8%; however, it hasn't grown in recent years. Moreover, the forward-looking AFFO payout ratio exceeds my comfort levels and stands at ~93.8%. The credit & financial stance is a major weakness of OLP. Risk Factors The weakness of OLP's credit metrics is certainly a risk to consider given the high interest rate environment and high payout ratio. Any events negatively impacting its financial performance could lead to the inability to increase or uphold its dividend. Naturally, any financial turmoil regarding OLP's tenant could translate into OLP's issues, which is the case for each REIT. Moreover, the Company delivered a weak AFFO per share growth and was outperformed by the key market players. Should this tendency continue, OLP will generate lower total returns than its peers. Any other material adverse changes could negatively impact its financial stance and lead to higher stock price volatility. Valuation Outlook & Key Takeaways As an M&A advisor, I usually rely on a multiple valuation method, which is a leading tool in transaction processes. This method allows for accessible and market-driven benchmarking. While this method is not perfect (or any other), as there are no identical companies, it provides a reference point for the market sentiment. However, reviewing the specific factors that may influence a given multiple is crucial. With that said, the forward-looking P/FFO ratio stood at:   13.2x for OPL  11.5x for WPC  10.6x for BNL  15.1x for STAG  12.8x for NNN  Also, PLD, EPRT, and ADC noticeably exceed OPL's multiple. Although OPL has some solid business metrics, high dividend yield, and ongoing portfolio restructuring towards industrial properties; the Company is accompanied by too many 'red flags' for my taste. Just to name a few of them:  low AFFO per share growth no dividend growth high AFFO payout ratio a history of poor capital allocation decisions that lead to inefficient portfolio  Given the above circumstances, I don't consider its 13.2x multiple justified compared to its peers. I won't consider it a potential opportunity until its valuation multiple approaches a more suitable range (given its credit and business stance) of 10.0x-11.0x.  There are significantly more attractive investment opportunities in the current market. I have recently covered most of the REITs I've mentioned in this article, each offering a better risk-to-reward ratio. As each investor's capital is limited, I prefer to allocate it to the leading industry representatives. OPL is currently not on that level; therefore, I have a bearish view.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

rxMVqkOEq8z3H0p,The Motley Fool,google,Could Amazon Beat Nvidia at Its Own Game?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/05/could-amazon-beat-nvidia-at-its-own-game/,2024-07-05 05:10,2024-07-05 05:14,AMZN,,"Nvidia (NVDA 4.57%) has become pretty much synonymous with artificial intelligence (AI) these days. The tech giant dominates the AI chip market, holding about 80% share, thanks to the strength of its graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips power some of the most important AI tasks, such as the training and inferencing of large language models (LLMs). The LLMs then are able to drive a wide range of AI programs, opening the door to the development of game-changing products and services.Though Nvidia is the market leader, it isn't the only chip designer on the block. In fact, Amazon (AMZN -1.21%), a company known for its ability to expand across a wide range of areas -- from e-commerce to healthcare and cloud computing -- also is playing a key role in the AI boom. Could this innovator eventually beat Nvidia at its own game and become a chip market leader? Let's find out.Image source: Getty Images.Amazon's biggest profit driverYou may know Amazon best for its e-commerce business, since it's the service most of us interact with on a regular basis -- as we order everything from food to general merchandise. But Amazon's biggest profit driver actually is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business. AWS is the world's biggest cloud provider and continues to expand and innovate.Today, AWS is heavily focused on AI and aims to serve customers' every AI need, offering them chips and a fully managed LLM service called Amazon Bedrock, as well as a variety of AI apps. The area of chips is where Amazon is moving in on Nvidia's territory, creating the Trainium and Inferentia chips specifically made for training and inference.These chips are less expensive than those of Nvidia and other rivals, and due to this, demand ""is quite high,"" Amazon said in a recent earnings call. The company isn't new to creating lower-priced chips, having already done so in the world of central processing units (CPUs) -- these are the main processors in any given computer. AWS' Graviton CPU served the company particularly well in recent times of higher inflation -- customers with strained budgets favored Graviton over more expensive options and stuck with AWS.Now, AWS says it will launch greater quantities of Trainium 2 later this year and into next. This AI chip's training performance is four times faster and memory capacity is three times larger than the first-generation Trainium.AWS' $100 billion run rateAll this is working out nicely for Amazon, with AWS this year reaching a $100 billion annual revenue run rate thanks to all of its AI products and services. So yes, Amazon is pouring investment into AI, but it's also showing it can monetize this move.At the same time, Amazon offers customers a wide variety of products and services -- including those from Nvidia. In fact, Amazon says it has the ""broadest selection"" around of Nvidia server resources, making it easy for AWS customers to choose Nvidia.Let's get back to our question: Could Amazon, an Nvidia partner, actually beat Nvidia at the AI chip game? I don't think either company has to worry about losing business due to the other. Yes, Amazon could attract customers aiming to limit costs as they launch AI projects or customers with projects that may not require the power and speed of an Nvidia GPU.Aiming to win the AI raceHowever, a vast number of companies aiming to win in the AI race, as well as those launching extensive AI platforms, likely will continue choosing Nvidia or other premium chips. The need for quality AI chips is strong enough for more than one player to be successful in the market today and moving forward.For example, Trainium and Inferentia are contributing to AWS' revenue growth, and at the same time, Nvidia is seeing demand for its upcoming Blackwell architecture and chip surpass supply. So there's real evidence that many product offerings could perform well in the AI market.All of this means Nvidia probably won't lose out as Amazon continues to strengthen its Trainium and Inferentia offerings -- and clearly, Amazon itself will benefit. So, Amazon likely won't beat Nvidia at its own game, and instead, both players, and their investors, could score a victory over the long term.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
IU4kuxPSRcAHeOh,The Motley Fool,google,"Home Depot Stock: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/05/home-depot-stock-buy-sell-or-hold/,2024-07-05 05:15,2024-07-05 05:19,HD,,"It's difficult to exactly time the market when considering whether to buy or sell a stock. Fortunately, stock traders with a long-term investment horizon don't need to put all that much emphasis on timing a stock decision. Long-term investors just need to do their stock-buying homework to better understand the business they might want to buy stock in. This research will help determine if a company's prospects are brightening or dimming. This type of homework is needed even for large, well-established companies.Over several decades, Home Depot (HD -0.40%) has grown into a major home improvement retailer with a track record of strong performance for shareholders. Lately, however, Home Depot's stock is lagging the broader market. Over the past year, its total return of 10.7% is well below the S&P 500's comparable 25.7% total return. Is this recent underperformance a warning signal to avoid Home Depot shares? Or is it a buying opportunity?Image source: Getty Images.Home Depot's performance is tied to the housing marketA check into Home Depot's business operations as well as a look at the broader economy suggests the underperformance is related more to the latter than the former. Elevated interest rates over the past two years have helped stagnate the housing market. There just aren't as many people buying existing homes and undertaking major renovations because it has become less affordable to do so. The interest rates are up to help get elevated inflation back under control. Inflation is falling but it remains somewhat elevated and it's leaving many consumers with less disposable cash to enact home repairs and renovations, creating another headwind for Home Depot.Home sales have been falling of late, in part because home prices in many markets that Home Depot operates in are still high. Existing home sales in May fell 0.7% from the previous month and 2.8% compared to last year.In its recent 10-Q report, Home Depot management specifically cited macroeconomic factors (including a shift in spending patterns among consumers and elevated interest rates) for the drop in same-store sales (comps). Total comparable sales in fiscal 2024's Q1 (ended April 28) fell 2.8%. Lower customer traffic accounted for 1.5 percentage points of that drop while less spending was blamed for the balance.As long as interest rates remain elevated, it's unclear how soon the situation will change.Home Depot maintains its enviable market shareCurrent investors can afford to be patient on Home Depot stock and wait out these short-term headwinds. One reason why is Home Depot's high market share. It opened its first store more than 40 years ago, and it has grown to become the world's largest home improvement retailer. Home Depot generated almost $153 billion in sales during fiscal 2023 (ended Jan. 28, 2024). That's much higher than its major competitor, Lowe's at $86.4 billion annually.The company's sheer size helps it to achieve economies of scale and pass some of these savings on to customers. The rest it keeps, helping it earn a nice margin. Despite sluggish sales, Home Depot's gross margin rebounded in the latest quarter, increasing to 34.1% from 33.7% the previous year.Home Depot is a dividend payerValue investors holding Home Depot stock can also afford to be patient. While Home Depot's profit fell 7% year over year to $3.6 billion in the first quarter, it still generates plenty of free cash flow (FCF). Its first-quarter FCF was $4.7 billion. After reinvesting in the business, management looks to return cash to shareholders, including via dividends. Those dividends are not in danger.The board of directors has raised dividend payments annually since 2010. That includes a 7.7% increase earlier this year. Home Depot has a 2.7% dividend yield, more than double the S&P 500's average of 1.3%.The current headwinds are not a threat to the dividend continuing to grow. Even during the Great Recession, Home Depot managed to generate enough profit to keep its payout constant, even if it determined it was prudent not to raise the dividend during the worst of that time.Home Depot presents a long-term opportunityWhen making a decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, a multitude of factors come into play. One of the more common metrics used to help in evaluating whether a stock is a good buy is the stock's price-to-earnings ratio. Home Depot's shares currently trade roughly in line with its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio average over the past decade.HD PE Ratio data by YChartsSo buying the stock now based on that P/E metric wouldn't represent a bargain, but it also wouldn't be overpaying. Given Home Depot stock is up 307% over that same decade, it has some of the qualifications needed for consideration as a growth stock. And by growth stock standards, Home Depot's 22 P/E multiple is much lower than the S&P 500's average P/E of 29. That suggests it might just be a bargain buy right now.Existing shareholders with a long-term investing mindset are likely best served by continuing to hold the shares, collecting the growing dividends, and waiting for the cyclical upturn.

But while it has been good news for many stocks on the index, there have been some extremely big disappointments as well. Three stocks that have generated disastrous returns thus far this year are Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA -4.06%), Lululemon Athletica (LULU -0.45%), and Intel (INTC 0.52%). Here's a look at why they have been struggling, and whether they're worth buying at their reduced prices.Walgreens Boots Alliance: Down 56%Pharmacy retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance gets the distinction of being the S&P 500's worst-performing stock at the midway point of 2024. Unfortunately, Walgreens was already a likely candidate for this distinction at the start of the year.In January, the company slashed its dividend in half as the new CEO, Tim Wentworth, has been on a mission to help turn around the struggling business.Unfortunately, it's not an easy task given that the healthcare company is still paying a (reduced) dividend, investing in a costly healthcare strategy that involves opening primary care clinics, and has a core business that normally generates thin margins as it is.Wentworth has admitted the company's ""current pharmacy model is not sustainable"" and that the business is looking at potentially closing up to one-quarter of its 8,600 U.S. stores. Although sales grew at a modest rate of 2.6% for the quarter ending May 31, the company lowered its guidance for adjusted earnings this year, noting a ""worse-than-expected U.S. consumer environment.""There's simply no reason to expect a turnaround for Walgreens stock anytime soon. Wentworth has a tough task on his hands in trying to make the pharmacy chain a better business. And investors are better off not waiting to see how that will turn out -- this is an incredibly risky stock. It wouldn't surprise me if management ends up scrapping the entire dividend in the near future.Lululemon Athletica: Down 41%Lululemon is the second-worst performing stock on the S&P 500 this year. High-priced apparel simply isn't in high demand at a time when consumers are struggling to pay bills. Lululemon's business is still generating decent growth; it just isn't as good as what investors have been hoping for.In the quarter ending April 28, the company reported revenue of $2.2 billion, a 10% increase year over year. And comparable-store sales were up 7% when excluding the impact of foreign currency. But its forecast for the current quarter calls for revenue growth between 9% and 10%. If not for the company's elevated valuation, Lululemon's stock might not have crumbled as much as it has this year. Amid this sell-off, the stock is now trading at a much more reasonable 24 times trailing earnings. At the beginning of the year, it was at a multiple of more than 50.With a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 1.2, now could be an advantageous time to buy the stock. It possesses a strong brand, and the business is still generating some growth.Intel: Down 39%Rounding out this list of disappointing stocks is Intel. The chipmaker's strategy to ramp up production in the U.S. hasn't convinced investors that it's a profitable move in the long run.In the most recent quarter (ended March 30), the company's foundry unit incurred an operating loss totaling just under $2.5 billion, and its sales declined by 10% year over year.CEO Pat Gelsinger projects that the foundry business has a tough road ahead but will break even in 2027. If that proves to be the case, then Intel could reverse these losses in the future. Without the aid of a crystal ball, however, investors are left having to decide whether or not to take a chance on Intel's stock.Normally, I would be inclined to say no, but I believe there's a big incentive for the U.S. government to help support Intel to ensure there are far greater chipmaking capabilities on U.S. soil and less dependence on foreign countries.Intel is a bit of a contrarian play, but I think it has the potential to be a good buy for the long haul. It might not recover this year, but for investors willing to absorb some risk, it can make for a good buy-and-hold investment.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tesla is the only foreign-owned EV car brand on the purchase catalog published by the government of Jiangsu province in eastern China. The other brands mentioned include Volvo, owned by China‚Äôs Geely, and state-owned SAIC.                That means that government agencies and public groups in the province can procure them as service cars, highlighting the cozy relationship China has with Elon Musk‚Äôs company.                The development has gone viral on Chinese social media, with some users questioning if foreign cars should be considered for use by the government.                The Jiangsu government has tried to ease such concerns by saying that the Tesla model is ‚Äúa domestic car, not imported,‚Äù according to a report by state-owned National Business Daily on Thursday, citing a government employee.

China has become an increasingly important market for Tesla, as the country accounts for more than half of the world‚Äôs total EV sales. Last year, Tesla derived nearly a quarter of its total revenue from China.                But the US carmaker is also facing rising competition from Chinese rivals. BYD overtook Tesla in the final quarter of 2023 as the biggest seller of EVs on the planet. Tesla regained its position in the first half of this year, but they are neck and neck.                Tesla cars had previously been¬†barred from entering¬†some government and military complexes in China due to spying and data security concerns.                Those restrictions were lifted in April, when a top auto association announced that Tesla‚Äôs cars had passed China‚Äôs data security requirements.¬†The announcement came on the same day as Musk visited Beijing and met with Premier Li Qiang, who praised Tesla as a ‚Äúsuccessful model‚Äù for US-China collaboration.

That‚Äôs how Wall Street sees it, as Tesla bulls are once again ascendant.Over the last week, Tesla shares have surged more than 25%, boosted by vehicle deliveries that beat estimates, leaving the paltry gains of the rest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" in the dust.When CEO Elon Musk insisted earlier this year that Tesla isn‚Äôt a car company, the message jolted the stock price even as sales faltered. While convenient, the pitch was true enough. And the edict apparently goes both ways.The stock surge speaks to the power of touting an industry-leading product ‚Äî a lesson for AI startups ‚Äî and the benefit of making AI ambitions a part of a broader business plan, rather than the sole aspect of it. But conversely, it underscores that Tesla‚Äôs heady AI goals are still closely tethered to its car sales.Combining lofty techno-ambitions with moving cars off lots has been key to Musk‚Äôs salesmanship.‚ÄúIn a nutshell, the worst is in the rear-view mirror for Tesla as we believe the EV demand story is starting to return to the disruptive tech stalwart,‚Äù outspoken Tesla backer Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities wrote in a note earlier this week.The upbeat delivery data counters a wave of negative sentiment.Driven by stiffening competition in China, softening demand at home, price cuts, layoffs, and Musk‚Äôs legal and corporate dramas, Tesla had limped along as a Magnificent Seven laggard. But recent wins have a way of erasing earlier losses. And Tesla is now riding a string of victories, with an earnings report and a much-hyped robotaxi unveiling just around the corner.Investors are buying into the shifting mood. Since a low in late April, Tesla is up more than 60%.But even some Tesla backers are poking holes in the latest rally. It‚Äôs true Tesla beat expectations, but sales fell from the same period last year. And how have more aggressive rivals and cheaper prices eaten into profitability?‚ÄúIn reality Tesla EV sales were down 5% and the company seems to be capitulating to the idea of selling EVs. It‚Äôs all about FSD and taxis now,‚Äù said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, referring to Full Self-Driving.In some ways, Tesla‚Äôs flexible identity as a car company when times are good and a tech company when the chips are down can be a hindrance to a clear corporate strategy. Is Tesla still gunning for a mass-market EV in every family‚Äôs driveway? Or is it a platform orchestrating a fleet of autonomous taxis expanding the frontier of AI technology?Story continuesIt can be both, of course. And Musk is prone to wanting it all. Investors don‚Äôt seem to mind which metaphorical cap the company is wearing on any particular day. Just as long as the numbers go up. AI can make that happen.

Vy642t4mjBHUkBN,The Motley Fool,google,These 5 Stocks Account for 63% of the S&P 500 Returns So Far This Year. Can Their Dominance Continue?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/05/these-5-stocks-account-for-63-of-the-sp-500-return/,2024-07-05 06:04,2024-07-05 06:08,META,,"We're officially halfway through 2024, and it's shaping up to be another great year for stock investors.The S&P 500 produced a total return of 15.3% through the end of June. That's more than double its historical average for the first half of the year. Its continuous push to new all-time highs bodes well for the second half of the year, too.If you look under the hood, the vast majority of the S&P 500's returns have been driven by just five stocks through the first half of 2024. The list isn't too dissimilar from the group of stocks that accounted for the bulk of 2023's return either. If you know about the ""Magnificent Seven,"" you'll be familiar with these names. Can these five continue their dominance through the rest of the year?The five stocks accounting for 63% of the S&P 500's returns in 2024The S&P 500's aggregate market capitalization increased $5.8 trillion through the first half of 2024.The following five stocks generated the biggest market cap increases during the first six months of the year, totaling about 63% of the S&P 500s increase in value for 2024.StockMarket Cap Jan. 1Market Cap June 28IncreaseIncrease as a % of S&P 500 GainNvidia (NVDA 4.57%)$1.223 trillion$3.039 trillion$1.816 trillion31.3%Microsoft (MSFT 0.32%)$2.795 trillion$3.322 trillion$527 billion9.1%Alphabet (GOOG 0.42%) (GOOGL 0.31%)$1.764 trillion$2.266 trillion$502 billion8.7%Amazon (AMZN -1.21%)$1.57 trillion$2.013 trillion$443 billion7.6%Meta Platforms (META 0.09%)$910 billion$1.279 trillion$369 billion6.4%Total$8.262 trillion$11.919 trillion$3.663 trillion63.2%Data source: YCharts.All of those companies were already among the largest components of the S&P 500 to start the year. Nvidia's continued dominance of the AI chip market has fueled a massive increase in its stock value. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are four of the biggest companies investing in developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon also provide the cloud platforms required for training and running AI-powered applications.The current trend toward generative AI favors the biggest companies. Building large data centers capable of training large language models and running inferences all day requires a ton of capital. Meta leading the group with its plan to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion in capital expenditures this year. That's an investment smaller companies can't even start to compete with, especially in today's interest rate environment where debt isn't nearly as cheap as it used to be.As a result, the S&P 500 has become increasingly concentrated among just a few companies. Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple account for 20% of the index's value. The next seven components add another 16%. We haven't had this level of concentration among the top-10 companies in the S&P 500 since the 1970s.While there are good reasons for the current level of concentration, investors need to ask if these giant companies can continue to lead the market higher.Who will lead the next leg up in the market?Rising concentration in the stock market isn't inherently a concern. As mentioned, there are good reasons the biggest companies have gotten bigger. But, investors should remain mindful of valuations and where the market presents good value.Nvidia, for example, trades for a forward PE of around 47. That makes it a risky bet on its continued dominance of the AI chip market. It faces challenges from other chipmakers, and its biggest customers are designing their own chips to reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Analysts currently expect strong bottom-line growth for Nvidia, but its high valuation makes any shortfall extremely damaging to the share price.Not every member of the above group is expensive. Meta Platforms and Alphabet trade for forward PEs around 25x. While those valuations are higher than the S&P 500's overall earnings multiple, it's not an outlandish multiple relative to their earnings growth prospects.Looking beyond the biggest companies may present many more opportunities for investors. The S&P 500 equal-weight index historically outperforms the cap-weighted index over the long run. Smaller companies typically grow faster than the giants at the top of the market.

If so, take note: A new Tesla dealership is under construction in Meridian.The dealership is going up on 5.7 acres at 2554 W. Franklin Road, next to an Amazon distribution center that was finished two years ago near Ten Mile Road.Tesla already has a dealership near Cole and Victory roads in Southwest Boise, but it‚Äôs tucked away in a multitenant industrial building at 2592 Beverly St. that few drivers pass. Tesla wanted a traditional location with higher visibility, said Brad Miller, managing director at Boise‚Äôs Adler Industrial, the new dealership‚Äôs developer.The one-story dealership will be on a prominent street and will display two or three cars behind glass walls, Miller said. He said Tesla chose the location because the area around Ten Mile‚Äôs interchange with Interstate 84 and its intersection with Franklin Road has become the center of Idaho‚Äôs Treasure Valley.ADVERTISEMENT‚ÄúAs the Ten Mile-Franklin area builds out, it‚Äôs just a spectacular location with all the development that‚Äôs going on there,‚Äù Miller said by phone.Tesla has dominated the rising U.S. electric-vehicle market so far, CNET reported in March. Musk, the CEO who also runs SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter), cofounded Tesla in 2003.CNET listed prices for Tesla models ranging from $40,000 to nearly $99,000, including the angular, avant-garde Cybertruck, sightings of which recently began to rise in the Treasure Valley.Tesla model (2024)Low-endMiddleHigh-endModel 3$40,380N/A$49,130Model Y$49,130$50,380$53,880Model S$76,380N/A$91,380Model X$81,380N/A$96,380Cybertruck$59,635$78,635$98,635Source: CNETAdler Industrial also built and owns the Amazon distribution center. The company is working on about 10 buildings in the Ten Mile Area, he said.Discussions between Adler and Tesla began in the fall of 2022. They entered into a long-term lease in July 2023. Tesla will occupy the dealership this September, Miller said. He said he does not know when the dealership will open. An email to Tesla was not returned.Story continuesThe dealership will provide sales and service. While large car dealerships display hundreds of cars, Tesla‚Äôs showroom will have only 1,700 square feet, because every car at Tesla is made to order depending on a buyer‚Äôs budget, lifestyle and driving habits. All the new cars ordered from the Meridian area will be delivered to the new dealership, where they will be cleaned and prepared for customers, Miller said.Supercharger at Sonic, Destination Chargers at hotelsThe dealership will have a Supercharger station, where Tesla car owners will be able to recharge their EVs speedily using direct current. It would be the third Supercharger station in the Boise area: There‚Äôs one at 851 N. Orchard St., next to a Sonic Drive-in restaurant on the Bench; and one at 1426 S. Entertainment Ave. behind the Oxford Suites Boise.The area also has two, slower-charging Destination Charging stations, a type often located at restaurants, hotels or shopping centers. They are free to use for Tesla drivers who are customers of the destinations. Boise has one at the Residence Inn by Marriott at 1401 S. Lusk Place, and Meridian has one at the Candlewood Suites at 1855 S. Silverstone Way.Tesla already has a dealership at 2592 Beverly St. in Boise and two supercharger stations in the area. Superchargers allow Tesla car owners to recharge their vehicles. The new dealership in Meridian will have a Supercharger station. Destination Charging stations are often located at restaurants, hotels, or shopping centers. They are free for all Tesla drivers who are customers of the destinations where stations are located.The designer for the dealership was Meridian‚Äôs ADP Architects, which had weekly meetings with Tesla‚Äôs project managers. Glenn Walker, principal architect at ADP, said Tesla gave them conceptual ideas with examples of other dealerships they have across the country.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the exact design as their buildings, but the look is fairly similar,‚Äù Walker said by phone.This project was more challenging and ‚Äúa lot more intense‚Äù than other buildings they worked on with Adler that are ‚Äúmore straightforward and cookie-cutter,‚Äù Walker said. Tesla had extensive specifications for the building, he said.Miller said the dealership will not have a noticeable impact on the level of traffic on Franklin Road. He said some ‚Äúcar related businesses‚Äù have contacted them and showed interest in the location and in being close to a Tesla dealership.Two of Adler‚Äôs industrial buildings are going to be built across the street from the Tesla dealership, and one is going to be at the traffic signal to the east of the dealership, Miller said. They have yet to know who the buildings will be rented out to. Adler will break ground on these three buildings in the next 60 days, while their remaining seven projects will be carried out over the next five to six years, Miller said.This piece of Meridian wasn‚Äôt supposed to become like the rest of it.

CgATYGYHoNlPCJZ,Yahoo Finance Canada,google,Earnings season to test hopes for broader stocks rally,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-season-test-hopes-broader-101113639.html,2024-07-05 06:11,2024-07-05 06:20,META,,"By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) - Hopes that the U.S. stocks rally will broaden beyond megacaps like Nvidia will be tested in coming weeks as investors learn whether profit growth from other companies is starting to catch up with that of the tech-related leaders.The S&P 500 has rallied 16% so far in 2024, driven by a handful of massive stocks poised to benefit from emerging artificial intelligence technology. Only 24% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in the first half, the third-narrowest six-month period since 1986, according to BofA Global Research strategists.Meanwhile, the equal-weight S&P 500 -- a proxy for the average stock -- is only up around 4% this year. As of Tuesday, about 40% of S&P 500 components were down for the year.ADVERTISEMENTSecond-quarter earnings kick off next week with major banks including JPMorgan and Citigroup reporting on July 12. Investors will be watching whether profits from other companies are catching up with the ""Magnificent 7"": Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Tesla, many of which rebounded from struggles in 2022.Investors generally view a narrow rally as more fragile, because weakness in just a few big stocks could sink indexes, but some hope gains will spread during the second half.More companies are projected to post improved earnings as many investors expect the economy to navigate a soft landing, which could boost stocks trading at more moderate valuations than market leaders.""If we're looking for a catalyst to have broader participation in this rally this year, the second-quarter earnings reporting season may well be the start of that,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.The S&P 500 is trading at about 21 times forward earnings estimates, but if the top 10 stocks by market value are excluded that figure drops to 16.5 on average for the rest of the index, Hogan said.In a further sign of the narrow rally, the information technology and communication services sectors, which include most of the Magnificent 7, are the only two of 11 S&P 500 sectors to outperform the broader index this year.Story continuesEarnings among the Magnificent 7 rose 51.8% year-on-year in the first quarter compared to 1.3% earnings growth for the rest of the S&P 500, according to Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG.That gap is expected to shrink, with forecasts for Magnificent 7 year-on-year earnings rising 29.7% in the second quarter and earnings among the rest of the index up 7.2%, according to LSEG.""We think greater balance in profitability could lead to broader market participation in the coming quarters,"" Chris Haverland, global equity strategist with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute (WFII), said in a note on Tuesday.The WFII suggests investors trim gains in the technology and communication services sectors to take advantage of weakness in energy, healthcare, industrials and materials.Later in the year, the Magnificent 7's profit advantage is expected to diminish further. The group's year-on-year earnings growth is expected to be 17.4% in the third quarter and 18.3% in the fourth. That compares with rest-of-index earnings growth of 6.8% in the third quarter and 13.9% in the fourth.""We anticipate that we're going to have nearly all sectors of the S&P participating in earnings growth in 2024,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management.Not everyone is convinced that other groups are poised to catch up, as AI remains a dominant theme. Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management, said he had doubts about earnings growth meeting expectations, due to weak consumer spending, sticky inflation and other concerning economic indicators.Still, in coming days, investors could get a clearer view of the economy's health and when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates, which could also trigger broader market gains. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to testify before Congress on Tuesday, while Thursday's release of the monthly consumer price index provides a crucial look at inflation.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Michelle Price and David Gregorio)",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
kKE9zebqVcZhm46,The Motley Fool,google,Better Chip Stock: Arm Holdings vs. Intel,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/05/better-chip-stock-arm-holdings-vs-intel/,2024-07-05 06:15,2024-07-05 06:22,ARM,,"Arm Holdings (ARM 2.92%) and Intel (INTC 0.52%) are two of the most important chipmakers in the world. Arm is the world's leading designer of mobile CPUs, while Intel is the largest producer of PC and server CPUs.Arm only licenses its designs to other chipmakers, but Intel is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) that designs, manufactures, and markets its own chips. Arm's flexible approach and power-efficient designs enabled its top customers -- including Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple -- to conquer the smartphone chip market.Intel, which stubbornly tried to miniaturize its PC-oriented x86 CPUs for mobile devices, failed to keep up with those Arm-based chipmakers.Image source: Getty Images.Arm went public again last September, seven years after it was acquired by SoftBank. It stock has more than tripled from its IPO price of $51 to nearly $160 today. Intel's shares have declined about 20% during the same period. Let's see why Arm outperformed Intel by such a wide margin -- and whether it could remain the better buy for the foreseeable future.Why did Arm's stock skyrocket?Arm doesn't face any meaningful competitors in its core market; its dominant chip designs are used in about 99% of all premium smartphones. However, that means Arm's sales ebb and flow with the cyclical demand for new smartphones.Arm has been designing new chips for the cloud and auto markets, and it expects those higher-growth sectors to gradually curb its dependence on smartphones. It also anticipates the rising demand for its higher-royalty artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized Armv9 chip designs to drive its near-term expansion across the smartphone, cloud, and auto sectors.Arm's revenue grew 33% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in March of that year) as the 5G market expanded, but dipped 1% in fiscal 2023 as the 5G upgrade cycle cooled off. In fiscal 2024, its revenue rose 21% as the smartphone market stabilized, it expanded its share of the auto and cloud markets, and it licensed more AI-oriented chips.For fiscal 2025, Arm expects its revenue to grow 18%-27% as its adjusted EPS increases 14%-30%. That acceleration makes it seem like a balanced way to profit from the long-term expansion of the mobile, cloud, and AI markets.But at $160 per share, Arm already trades for more than 100 times the midpoint of its estimated earnings this year. That frothy valuation suggests there's a bit too much AI hype baked into its price, even though it isn't growing as rapidly as market leaders like Nvidia.Why did Intel's stock stumble?Intel still controls 64% of the x86 CPU market, according to PassMark Software, but it has ceded a lot of share to AMD¬†over the past eight years. As Intel struggled to manufacture smaller, denser, and more power-efficient CPUs on its own, AMD outsourced its production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Intel then fell behind TSMC in the process race as it grappled with chip delays and shortages, and AMD pulled ahead with cheaper and more advanced CPUs.Intel's revenue rose 1% in 2021, but declined 20% in 2022 and dropped another 14% in 2023. That deceleration was caused by sluggish sales of PCs, intense competition from AMD, and the data center market's focus on buying Nvidia's GPUs to process AI tasks instead of upgrading their older CPUs. As Intel faces those tough headwinds, it's trying to upgrade its own foundries to catch up to TSMC, but that costly expansion effort is crushing its operating margins.That situation seems bleak, but analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to increase 3% and 4%, respectively, in 2024 as the PC market stabilizes, it ramps up its shipments of its Meteor Lake chips, and the macro environment improves. The bulls expect Intel's growth to accelerate in 2025 if it finally catches up to TSMC, but its stock isn't a bargain at 29 times forward earnings. It also cut its dividend last year, and its forward yield of 1.6% won't attract any serious income investors.The better buy: ArmI'm not a fan of either of these chip stocks right now. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd pick Arm because it's growing a lot faster, has a wider moat, operates a high-margin business, and doesn't face any existential threats. Intel isn't down for the count yet, but it needs to either catch up with TSMC or go fabless like AMD to impress the bulls again.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

While consumer spending is a big focus in the U.S. because it is a great macroeconomic indicator, several factors impact it. These factors include job stability, inflation, income, interest rates and taxes. The state of the economy, as well as the confidence people have in it, are big factors as well. Although real wages have been reduced recently, with inflation coming off of all-time highs, consumer spending is expected to increase. Additionally, with summer on the way, spending in home improvement stores will increase, because consumers try to take on home-improvement passion projects when the weather‚Äôs nice. Regardless, the three companies selected today have great financials, as well as great growth potential regardless of the time of year. As I said, with consumer spending forecast to increase, now is the perfect time to invest in these three consumer stocks.Costco Wholesale (COST)Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is an internationally known wholesale-style superstore. It provides consumers the option to purchase goods in higher quantities than regular stores, thereby increasing the money they save. It also has Costco Business Centers, which are stores that cater to businesses. However, their main focus is consumer sales.COST‚Äôs financials are great. While its profit and operating margins are low (2.83% and 3.76%, respectively), this isn‚Äôt a matter of concern. The bulk of its profits come from the sales of memberships, as it is a member-only chain. This is somewhat reflected in year-on-year quarterly revenue and earnings growth. COST revenue grew by 9.1%, while earnings grew by 29.1% in the same period. Additionally, a beta of 0.77 indicates that this company is a stable pick.The company is well-known for the use of loss leaders, such as the $5 rotisserie chicken and $1.50 hot dog-and-soda combo meal. These deals get consumers in the door after which they are more likely to spend more than planned. This has played a part in its growth with same-store sales up 7% this quarter. This has become a popular meme on social media, with multiple accounts making fun of this. Yet COST also has a loyal fanbase, and at the moment, has no serious risks, making it a buy.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is among the best-known Mexican fast-casual chains in the U.S. It also operates internationally, with stores in Canada and Europe. The U.S., though remains its largest market. After its 50-to-1 stock split, the stock corrected by 10%, making it the perfect time to jump in.CMG stock is trading at $61.58 with a market valuation of $84.57 billion. The company‚Äôs financials and growth are solid with revenue and earnings increasing by considerable amounts. CMG has a profit margin of 12.70% with an operating margin of 16.54%. It also has a return on equity of 44.37%, indicating management‚Äôs effectiveness. While quarterly revenue and earnings are up 14.1% and 23.2% year-over-year, the company has come under fire recently. Reduced portion sizes have led to customers boycotting the brand or simply walking out mid-order. This represents a serious risk for the chain, especially as this reputation becomes more well-known but management is taking steps to counter this development. Regardless, analysts are predicting stock price growth of 7.5% for the rest of this year, indicating its shares are likely to continue growing, making it a buy.Home Depot (HD)Source: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.comHome Depot (NYSE:HD) provides consumers access to home-improvement goods. While its main market is the U.S., it also operates internationally. The range of products offered is vast, from garage doors to toilets. It also serves construction workers, carpenters or any other professional engaged in building and home improvement services.The company has a solid profit and operating margin sitting at 9.79% and 13.95%, respectively. This is likely due to its bare-bones design. Like Costco, the store is the warehouse itself. Management effectiveness is off the charts with Yahoo Finance reporting a return on equity of 1,362.97%. While revenue and earnings have fallen slightly this quarter, this dip isn‚Äôt indicative of a long-term trend.¬†A hike in its dividend by management puts focus on the company‚Äôs cash flow and is indicative of a bullish future. Analysts are predicting share price growth of 14.88% through the remainder of this year. While the company does have competition from stores like Lowe‚Äôs (NYSE:LOW), recent moves such as the acquisition of SRS Distribution make the stock a worthy buy.On the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

YuAMq6l1mxz0QWq,BBC,bing,'I‚Äôve invented an alternative to uncomfortable smear tests',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckkkgvl59x3o?sfnsn=scwspmo,2024-07-05 06:44,2024-07-05 06:54,ARM,,"When S√¢nziana Foia went for her first smear test at the age of 25, she was surprised by how uncomfortable she found the whole experience.  The post-graduate student thought there must be different and better ways of testing women for the signs of cervical cancer.  S√¢nziana said: ""I had my first smear test about three years ago and it was a hugely unpleasant experience. Talking to other women I realised it's actually quite a shared unpleasant experience.  ""Since I was already doing a PHD in bio-engineering and I was developing bio-sensors,  I thought maybe there is a way to do this that's non-invasive and that women can have control over themselves.  ""This hasn't been innovated in decades so it seemed like a good place to start."" She got to work and the result is a new system called Papcup, a small device which enables women to test themselves at home using a sample of menstrual blood. The device looks for signs of the cancer-causing HPV strains, in the same way a traditional smear would. But there is no need for a doctor's appointment or to wait for results. S√¢nziana told BBC Scotland News: ""It's a small device, about the size of my fist. You add to it a sample of menstrual blood that you collect with a swab. ""In the device is a bio-sensor which is the detection unit. That reads how much HPV there is in the sample and comes up with a read-out in about 15 minutes.  ""This device aims to provide a virtually instant test because everything else takes days or weeks to come back as a result. "" The Papcup has passed the feasibility stage and a prototype is now being developed. Once that is ready there will be further refinement and clinical trials. S√¢nziana said: ""We have developed the mechanical designs, the electronics and we have the proof of concept for the bio-censors.   ""Now it's a matter of bringing it all together and being able to demonstrate this on the table, raising investment so we can refine the bio-sensor, and down the line clinical trials so we can finally bring this to women as a product."" S√¢nziana - who is originally from Romania - is doing her PHD at Imperial College London, where her idea was initially developed through its Advanced Hackspace mentoring system. But she now receives support from a programme at the University of Edinburgh called the Venture Builder Incubator, which aims to help innovations progress from idea to reality.  Andrew Parfery is the programme manager for VBI. ""The gap that we're here to plug is to help researchers, PHD students and academic staff take their idea and innovation and turn it into a business and launch it into the market to have real impact,"" he said. ""We're here for people across the universities of the UK, in particular those that have a health and social care innovation, so we're open now for applications in particular for those that have technology-driven solutions."" The most recent NHS data shows that around a third of women in the UK don't attend their smear test appointments. The take-up rate is lower in certain areas, meaning many are missing their chance for cancer-causing HPV strains to be spotted. An early diagnosis can potentially save lives according to Cancer Research Horizons, which is the commercial arm of the charity.   Cidgem Selli is from CRH, which has been involved in S√¢nziana's project. She said: ""We know one in two people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives.  ""If we can detect cancer earlier using novel health technologies and inventions that are brought from the laboratories to the bedside, then we will save many lives."" The uptake of smear tests amongst younger women is also lower but S√¢nziana hopes her device will change this. ""Once they turn 25 and they've had their first smear tests, a lot of them are delaying their next appointments,  postponing or skipping altogether, or they live with anxiety for months leading up to it. ""But they can use the new test in their own private safe spaces - they don't need to interact with a complete stranger in such a vulnerable position. It gives them back the power to test on their terms."" Post-menopausal women and those who don't menstruate can still use the test. She said: ""They can still test with a Papcup using a traditional swab. It still poses some advantages as you collect the swab yourself and the result is still instant, so you don't have to send it off to a lab and wait anxiously for weeks for your results to come back."" The routine smear test looks for cancer-causing HPV strains, and if they are found then there are further investigations. The Papcup also looks for harmful HPV strains.  S√¢nziana said: ""If someone gets a positive HPV test then they might want to go and get the full smear test for full diagnosis, where they look in depth at what's going on. But we aim to break through that first barrier that women have towards getting their smear test. ""It's very much about addressing this gap in healthcare and inequalities which lead to women skipping their appointments. We hope to be able to offer women a much more comfortable screening experience."" Copyright 2024 BBC.

Cramer recalled his days at the Harvard Law School and how he used to run to the library to read research reports on companies to dig out information on quality stocks on a week-to-week basis. When Cramer joined Goldman Sachs, an ‚Äúexecutive‚Äù at the firm introduced him to the concept of suitability, advising him never to recommend stocks to people without knowing what they want out of investing. According to Cramer, that ‚Äúbest semiconductor stock‚Äù might not be good for all individuals and therefore it‚Äôs necessary to know the ‚Äútolerance‚Äù and risk appetite of investors.Answering a question during the program, Cramer said technical analysis, including paying attention to RSI values, is ‚Äúincredibly‚Äù important to him and he does not like to buy stocks if ‚Äútheir chart is bad.‚ÄùFor this program we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he talked about recently. These include stocks he‚Äôs bullish on as well as the ones he recommends selling. We have analyzed each stock in detail to see its fundamentals and know what the Wall Street believes about it. We have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment with each company. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

While Apple surged in the wake of artificial intelligence (AI) announcements in June, its gains in the first half lagged those of Nvidia and other Magnificent 7 stocks.Some experts say it could become more difficult for the companies to meet investors' lofty expectations. Others think the big tech rally could broaden across the market. While enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) has helped drive many of the Magnificent 7 stocks to outperform the market in 2024 so far, a few have struggled to keep pace. Looking to the second half of the year, experts warn investors' lofty expectations for the group‚Äîmade up of Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA)‚Äîcould become more difficult to meet, raising questions about how long big tech's AI-fueled momentum can last.  Most of the Magnificent 7 Has Outperformed the S&P 500 in 2024, But Apple and Tesla Lagged   After the Magnificent 7 stocks drove gains for the S&P 500 in 2023, divergence in the performance of stocks in the group widened in 2024. Nvidia has more than doubling since the start of the year, while Tesla has lost close to 1%. Meta shares have gained 44%, and Alphabet rose 33%. Amazon and Microsoft climbed 30% and 22%, respectively, fueled by AI-related growth. Those stocks, along with Nvidia, outperformed the S&P 500, which rose 16%. Apple has slightly lagged the index, gaining 15% after the iPhone maker's stock picked up steam in the second quarter driven by AI announcements. Tesla is the only Magnificent 7 stock that has declined since the start of 2024, giving way to calls for a reexamination of whether the electric vehicle maker belongs in the grouping. However, it has kicked off July with a surge in its stock that nearly erased year-to-date losses on better-than-expected deliveries in the second quarter. Some analysts have suggested that the fresh numbers could mark a ""turning point"" for Tesla.   TradingView  High Expectations Could Make It Harder for Magnificent 7 Stocks To Impress Investors   Looking ahead, it's become a question of ""who can deliver"" on investors' lofty expectations for the Magnificent 7, Steve Sosnick, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers told Investopedia. Sosnick expressed concerns about how these companies will keep up with investors' AI-drive expectations, especially with long development timelines that mean returns on big tech companies' AI spending could be years away. Goldman Sachs analysts project that Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple will see second-quarter earnings grow 30% year-over-year, compared to 9% for the S&P 500 and 5% for the rest of the market. Disappointments, the analysts said, are ""likely to be heavily punished.""  Magnificent 7 Moves Will Affect Broader Market   How the stocks perform will likely have an outsized affect on the broader market in the months to come. In the first half of the year, the performance of Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft accounted for 62% of the S&P 500's return. The market is being led ""by a fairly small list of stocks,"" causing it ""to become very top-heavy,"" Sosnick said. ""For better or worse, we're going to live or die with them,."" UBS Chief Investment Officer Solita Marcelli said UBS ""expect[s] the rally to broaden and investors should not neglect opportunities beyond recent US tech leaders.""Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

bFT6oXTn8hTPk7y,Seeking Alpha,google,Volkswagen's Rivian Tie-Up Could Finally Make The Stock Worth Considering (OTCMKTS:VWAGY),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702538-volkswagen-rivian-tie-up-could-make-stock-worth-considering,2024-07-05 06:57,2024-07-05 07:08,RIVN,,"Volkswagen dealership car store Vera Tikhonova/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Volkswagen AG√¢¬Ä¬ôs (OTCPK:VWAGY) intention to transition to battery-electric vehicles (BEV) from internal combustion engines (ICE), announced six years ago, has stumbled badly, as have similar strategies by incumbents General Motors Co. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F). The main questions now in front of VW are how much of the $48 billion the German automaker pledged to invest in BEVs can avoid being entirely wasted and how quickly the automaker can regroup on a new path toward achieving electrification in the future. For much of its history, VW has been a top global producer, admired for its engineering excellence and its many prestigious brands, which include Porsche, Audi and Bentley. Oddly, VW has tended to underperform in the U.S., the world's most profitable vehicle market, where it has struggled to understand American consumers and thus has been passed by the likes of Toyota, Honda and Hyundai. VW's recent plan to revive International Harvester's Scout brand, built as a BEV in the U.S., is latest effort to grow in the U.S. Middle Kingdom presence China is a special case: VW was there early and, until 2022, was the market leader. BYD became number-one, largely because VW has not kept up with the trend toward BEVs in the Middle Kingdom. This situation could change. VW acquired roughly 5% of Chinese automaker XPeng and announced a master agreement on architecture and software collaboration designed to produce two mid-size VW models for Chinese consumers starting in 2026. The move could help VW slow, and perhaps reverse, the decline in Chinese sales that had plagued the company for the past several years. In the U.S., where VW has maintained a market share in the neighborhood of 3.5% to 4%, sales of its ID4 BEV lately have struggled in the face of intense competition from rival makes and waning consumer interest in BEVs generally. McKinsey & Co.'s 2024 Mobility Consumer Pulse study reveals that 46 percent of EV owners in the United States, well above the worldwide average of 29 percent, want to switch to gasoline cars and hybrids because of the inadequate charging infrastructure and questions about range.   VW ID4 Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) (Volkswagen AG) In late June, VW and Rivian jointly announced a technology partnership under which VW will pump up to $5 billion into Rivian and gain access to the latter√¢¬Ä¬ôs electrical and electronic architecture and related software. Shares of Rivian, which are selling in the neighborhood of $15, well off the high of nearly $180 in November of 2021, have benefitted from the announcement. But doubts about long-term viability still engulf the BEV startup and others like it, which had presumed consumer demand would be much greater by now. BEVs coming Notwithstanding delays and a crowded marketplace for BEVs, my analysis assumes that electrification including full BEV technology will be embraced by consumers eventually, albeit more slowly than planned by VW and other incumbents. The rollout will be quicker in the U.S., EU and other affluent industrialized societies with advanced power grids √¢¬Ä¬ì and slower in developing economies where transition costs from ICE are less easily borne. Oliver Blume, VW√¢¬Ä¬ôs CEO, inherited a technology mess from Herbert Diess. Diess lost the top job over disappointing performance of VW√¢¬Ä¬ôs Cariad software subsidiary, which had been created under him in 2020 to develop programs for a generation of models largely designed around advanced computing. Presumably, the links with XPeng and Rivian are meant to deliver what Cariad was unable. From the looks of the agreement with Rivian, VW has determined that Rivian√¢¬Ä¬ôs newest generation of electronic/electrical architecture and related software √¢¬Ä¬ì featured in newly facelifted Rivian models released on June 6 √¢¬Ä¬ì are immediately superior to what VW has and can be used on a range of VW Group models and brands. According to AFS Forecast Services: √¢¬Ä¬úRivian√¢¬Ä¬ôs zonal architecture system uses seven ECUs (electronic control units, i.e. computers) to operate the vehicle, down from the original seventeen. Each ECU handles more data and throughput as they are the new generation of systems on chips, or SoCs. Removing ten ECUs allowed Rivian to eliminate 1.6 miles (2.6km) from the wiring harness, reducing production costs. All seven domain controllers communicate with each other, even as they maintain control of their zones on the vehicle. Computing is key Additionally, Rivian√¢¬Ä¬ôs electronic architecture is expected to enable over-the-air (OTA) software updates, a key function (as in current Teslas) that permits software to be modified, repaired and upgraded remotely and automatically. According to AFS, owners of VW BEVs are experiencing numerous reliability problems that only can be resolved by visits to dealer service departments. VW√¢¬Ä¬ôs cash infusion will assist Rivian to expand production at its Normal, Illinois assembly plant. Prior to running short of cash, Rivian had planned to build a second assembly plant in Georgia for the introduction of new, smaller models, a project that now is on hold. Investors in Rivian will discover no shortage of viewpoints, predictions and analyses as to the startup√¢¬Ä¬ôs prospects for long-term viability. As incumbents such as VW steadily pivot toward BEVs, startups face tougher prospects for survival, the recent financial difficulties of BEV makers Fisker (FSRNQ) and Faraday Future (FFIE) illustrating the point. One potential outcome of the Rivian-VW agreement could be a future agreement and perhaps an outright acquisition by VW. Rivian is gaining in popularity with the smart set, much as Tesla did in its early days. With a market capitalization of $14.6 billion, Rivian would be well within VW√¢¬Ä¬ôs financial means; the German automaker has a historic habit of buying the brands of smaller companies such as Skoda and Seat and integrating them into the VW group. Euros to spare VW√¢¬Ä¬ôs total revenue reached $335.8 billion for 2023 with a net income of $18.3 billion or a fully diluted EPS of $35.27 per share √¢¬Ä¬ì up from $31.79 per share in 2022. The automaker holds a massive $53.4 billion in cash and short-term securities, as of its latest quarter, and $194.2 billion in common equity. The total return of VWAGY ADRs has been negligible over the past five years, less than 1%. Equity still hasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt recovered from the diesel emission cheating crisis of 2015. Data by YCharts VWAGY ADRs could be poised for a breakout if Blume can get the automaker√¢¬Ä¬ôs act together on the BEV and software front. Seeking Alpha and Wall Street analysts like the stock at its current price; but its Quant Rating is a hold. The stock√¢¬Ä¬ôs nearly 9% dividend yield is attractive, especially given VW√¢¬Ä¬ôs strong balance sheet. The company√¢¬Ä¬ôs alliances with XPeng and Rivian will be keys to the future, so watching them from quarter to quarter should provide clues whether it√¢¬Ä¬ôs time to take a plunge. For the moment, caution should be exercised. END  Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

As the year progressed, the market continued to soar higher, and Wall Street firms raised their targets for several tech stocks. Many hit all-time highs and are on a solid momentum. Investors did not want to miss this opportunity and dived in to grab AI stocks. The Nasdaq is up 18% and S&P 500 is up 15% since the start of the year. It isn‚Äôt too late to join the AI party if you to enjoy passive income as your capital grows. Let‚Äôs explore three AI dividend stocks to buy this month that will  generate quarterly income for you.¬†Oracle (ORCL)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a legacy software business that has been around since 1977. The company has gained momentum and attracted envious partnerships in the past few months. Exchanging hands for $144, the stock is up 38% year-to-date (YTD) and 143% in the past five years. ORCL stock has gone from $104 in Jan to $144 today. Multiple catalysts are working in favor of the stock.Its quarterly results show that the growth could multiply in the coming months. The revenue jumped 4% year-over-year (YOY) to hit $14.3 billion and the EPS stood at $1.63. It impressed the market with a 44% rise in the remaining performance obligations, a metric that refers to the value of future contracts to $98 billion. This shows that the company will report revenue growth in the coming quarter.Its partnership with Microsoft¬†(NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia¬†(NASDAQ:NVDA) and ChatGPT developer OpenAI will certainly pay off. The latter will use Oracle‚Äôs cloud infrastructure for its AI workload. Oracle has successfully signed 30 AI-related contracts in the recent quarter. As companies transition to the cloud, the demand for Oracle‚Äôs services will be on the rise.Also, the stock has a dividend yield of 1.11% and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.40. The company holds enough liquidity to increase the dividends in the coming quarters. Therefore, Oracle is an ideal combination of passive income and capital growth. While Oracle isn‚Äôt mentioned at the top when it comes to AI, it has the potential to become an industry leader and hit $200.¬†Microsoft (MSFT)Source: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft‚Äôs global presence, innovation and products set it apart from competitors. The company made a timely investment in OpenAI and is already reaping rewards.Up 24% YTD, MSFT stock is exchanging hands for $460.77 and is inching closer to $500. Yes, the stock isn‚Äôt cheap but you will never regret holding Microsoft stock for another decade. A leader in the space, Microsoft is a diversified business with a presence across multiple industries. This ensures that the company enjoys steady revenue growth, no matter how the market is moving.¬†The biggest revenue-generating segment is its cloud computing platform of Azure, which grew 31% YOY. The company has integrated AI across its wide range of products and services and has become indispensable to organizations.¬†A powerful player in the AI space, Microsoft easily manages to beat expectations and has achieved its target for each of the last four quarters. The company has a modest dividend yield of 0.70%, and there is room for improvement here.

The chip industry darling has had an exceptional year and its growth story is nothing short of phenomenal. However, this stock has a lot of room to run. Trading at $128.28 today, the stock has become cheaper for investors after the stock split. Now is the perfect time to pounce on it. The company is an industry leader making the most of the soaring AI demand.¬†As long as there is an imbalance in the demand and supply for AI chips, Nvidia is set to grow. There is no other stock that has become as popular as Nvidia this year. Earlier, gaming was its largest source of revenue and the data center growth transformed its journey. Competitors who are developing AI chips haven‚Äôt come even close to Nvidia‚Äôs dominance. As a result, its financials are stellar. The first-quarter revenue came in at $26 billion, a 262% YOY jump, and the net income stood at $15 billion.¬†Although Nvidia has a modest dividend yield of 0.031%, I believe the management could make a change there. After the stock split, we could see Nvidia hike the dividend. It will continue to see capital growth throughout the next year and an improvement in dividend payout could attract more investors.

rsAVxoeGINuV54F,CNN,google,Saks Fifth Avenue and Amazon are buying Neiman Marcus,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/saks-fifth-avenue-neiman-marcus-amazon/index.html,2024-07-05 07:10,2024-07-05 07:12,AMZN,,"New YorkCNN        ¬†‚Äî¬†                Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are merging to create a luxury department store empire. And Amazon wants to help.                Saks owner HBC announced a deal Thursday to acquire Neiman Marcus for $2.65 billion, establishing a luxury behemoth called Saks Global that has the two namesake department stores plus Saks Off 5th discount store and the upscale Bergdorf Goodman.                ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to take this step in bringing together these iconic luxury names, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman,‚Äù said HBC CEO Richard Baker in a release.                The two companies have been linked to merger talks for years, and the deal gives them more leverage to negotiate with luxury brands for lower costs. Saks has 39 stores, while Neiman Marcus, which filed for bankruptcy in 2020, has 36 stores. Neiman Marcus also owns Bergdorf Goodman.                Several leadership changes were also announced. Current Saks.com CEO Marc Metrick will become the CEO for the Saks Global business. Current HBC Properties and Investments CEO Ian Putnam will become CEO of Saks Global‚Äôs property and investments business. Both of them will report to Baker, who becomes the executive chairman of Saks Global.                The merger means that HBC‚Äôs Canadian business, which includes Hudson‚Äôs Bay department stores and $2 billion in property across the country, will operate separately from Saks Global. The unit ‚Äúwill be well positioned to support future growth, while continuing to serve its loyal Canadian base,‚Äù the release said.                The chains are responding to industry shifts, including the decline of department stores, and the growing power of luxury brands.                Brands such as Louis Vuitton parent LVMH are getting bigger and shifting their distribution strategy to direct-to-consumer sales, away from department stores. The planned Saks-Neiman Marcus merger seeks to wrest back some control. It also comes on the heels of Coach parent Tapestry‚Äôs proposal to buy Michael Kors owner Capri.                ‚ÄúAs a larger entity, negotiating power will be a little better with the brands, but even a combined chain would not match the heft and power of the global luxury conglomerates, which would still hold most of the card,‚Äù Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Wednesday.                Saks‚Äô deal could face regulatory scrutiny, however. The Federal Trade Commission sued to block Tapestry‚Äôs merger with Capri, saying it would harm competition.                ‚ÄúThe proposed merger threatens to deprive millions of American consumers of the benefits of Tapestry and¬†Capri‚Äôs head-to-head competition, which includes competition on price, discounts and promotions, innovation, design,¬†marketing and advertising,‚Äù the FTC said.                Amazon also is investing in the merger, working with Saks Global to ‚Äúinnovate on behalf of customers and brands partners following the close of the transaction,‚Äù the release said.                Amazon has tried to grow in physical retail. In 2022, it opened Amazon Style clothing stores in Glendale, California, and Columbus, Ohio, but closed them last year.                Saunders added that Amazon‚Äôs stake does ‚Äúmake sense, as it has ambitions to play more heavily in the luxury space and this would give it a toehold.‚Äù                ‚ÄúHowever, the real win here would be the ability of Amazon to streamline logistics and e-commerce, giving the new entity an advantage in a market where remote shopping has become more important to shoppers ‚Äî especially younger ones, which both chains need to do more to attract,‚Äù he said.",0.0,True,"Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are merging to create a luxury department store empire, and Amazon is investing in the merger to innovate on behalf of customers and brand partners.",,True,,breaking,2.0,"Amazon's investment in the merger of Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus positions it to benefit from the creation of a luxury department store empire, potentially expanding its market reach and customer base.",False,"{'keywords': 'Saks Fifth Avenue Amazon Neiman Marcus merger luxury department store', 'time_delta': '169.0', 'earleast_article': 'Saks Fifth Avenue Parent HBC Acquires Neiman Marcus for $2.65 Billion, Forming Saks Global', 'earleast_publisher': 'Business Times', 'earleast_url': 'https://news.google.com./articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idGltZXNvbmxpbmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzE2NzM3Ny8yMDI0MDcwNS9zYWtzLWZpZnRoLWF2ZW51ZS1wYXJlbnQtaGJjLWFjcXVpcmVzLW5laW1hbi1tYXJjdXMtZm9yLTItNjUtYmlsbGlvbi1mb3JtaW5nLXNha3MtZ2xvYmFsLmh0bdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen'}",2024-07-05 04:21:00,merger,

The firm's list this quarter includes eight names with near-term catalysts that can drive their share prices higher. Wells Fargo also identified two stocks that may retreat. Investors are quoestioning whether the first half's strong gains will continue in the back end of 2024. The broad S & P 500 rallied more than 14% in the first six months, while the artificial intelligence craze drove the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite higher by more than 18%. Against this backdrop, Wells Fargo ran a screen looking for stocks that its analysts rate overweight, and that have positive catalysts in the third quarter quarter. Its report was published Monday July 1. Here's which stocks made the cut: Capital One has a potential catalyst if the Discover merger goes through, according to Wells Fargo. On top of that, lower-income credit card holders may prove more resilient than currently believed. Concerns around its credit card holders have led Capital One to underperform this year, rising around 6% against the S & P 500 surging more than 14%. Wells Fargo is out of step on Wall Street, as the average analyst has a hold rating on Capital One. The average price target implies more than 10% upside, while Wells Fargo's target would equate to an 18% rally. For Ontario-based Algonquin Power & Utilities , Wells Fargo said the third quarter could provide clarity on the $5 billion market cap utility's strategic review of its non-regulated renewables platform. Algonquin's stock price reflects a belief that the renewable business won't be highly valued, whereas Wells Fargo thinks it could fetch $2.4 billion. Proceeds can be used to recapitalize Algonquin and authorize a large share buyback, the bank said. Algonquin shares, which yield more than 7%, have fallen more than 13% so far this year. The typical analyst surveyed by LSEG sees a bounce of more than 15%, while Wells Fargo sees the stock running up more than 44% without the dividend. By contrast, the average analyst has a hold rating, according to LSEG. Like other analog/mixed-signal chip companies, On Semiconductor is ""beginning to see green shoots of a cyclical upturn"" that imrpve gross margins, Wells Fargo said. Until now, On Semi has suffered as investors spurned automotive chipmakers this year. Its shares are down more than 14% in 2024, while the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) has soared more than 28%. ON .IXIC,SOXX YTD mountain On Semi vs Nasdaq Composite and iShares Semiconductor ETF year to date. On Semi may also benefit from announcements of important wins from original equipment manufacturers in China, including BYD, for its silicon carbide chip business, according to Wells Fargo. The average analyst polled by LSEG is also bullish. The typical price target implies nearly 16% upside, while Wells Fargo sees the stock soaring more than 37% from Monday's close. On the other hand, Wells Fargo said Tesla and Old Dominion Freight Line could see downside from negative catalysts in the third quarter. That call hasn't panned out so far for Tesla, which has soared 25% this week after reporting better-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) also clung to the flatline, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) edged up 0.1%.Investors are bracing for the June jobs report due at 8:30 a.m ET, on the alert for softening in the labor market. The report is expected to show nonfarm payrolls growth slowed to 190,000 rise in June and that the unemployment rate held steady at 4%.Signs of looser conditions in data earlier this week have bolstered the idea that inflation will keep cooling, setting the stage for the Fed to lower interest rates from their current two-decade high. Traders are now pricing in a nearly 75% chance of a cut in September, according to CME's FedWatch tool.The key question in Friday's jobs data is whether slowing monthly job growth reflects a normalization in the labor market as it shakes off the pandemic, or the early signs of a broader economic slowdown, Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports.Elsewhere, the Labour Party's landslide win in UK elections attracted attention from investors monitoring political risk in the US presidential race.

In May, the US economy added 272,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4%.Here are the key numbers Wall Street will be looking at compared to the previous month, according to data from Bloomberg:Nonfarm payrolls: +190,000 vs. +272,000 previouslyUnemployment rate: 4% vs. 3.9% previouslyAverage hourly earnings, month over month: +0.3% vs. +0.4% previouslyAverage hourly earnings, year over year: +3.9% vs. +4.1% previouslyAverage weekly hours worked: 34.3 vs. 34.3 previouslyThe report comes as the stock market has hit record highs amid a slew of softer-than-expected economic data, including readings on inflation that have the US pacing back toward a ""disinflationary path,"" according to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.Entering the print markets, investors are pricing in two interest rate cuts this year, with the first most likely to come in September. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, investors are pricing in a nearly 73% chance the Fed cuts rates in September.The key question in Friday's report and throughout the rest of 2024 remains whether slowing monthly job growth is merely a sign of normalization in the labor market or the early signs of a broader economic slowdown. For now, economists believe Friday's data will favor the latter.Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen reasoned in a weekly research note that the report will likely show a labor market that is ""cooling but not cool.""Still, with unemployment claims rising and the unemployment rate at its highest level in more than two years, House and other economists have noted that the key concern at the moment is that the labor market will keep decelerating to a weaker landing point than the pre-pandemic economy.""Given the cooling evident over the past year in the labor market, we see further labor market weakening as becoming more worrisome and less welcomed by the Fed,"" Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House said.Wed, July 3, 2024 at 9:15 AM PDTAlexandra CanalWall Street weighs in after Tesla's positive delivery resultsTesla shares (TSLA) rallied again on Wednesday, up more than 5%, after jumping 10% on Tuesday on the heels of better-than-expected quarterly vehicle delivery results.Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferr√© has the story: Tesla this week announced it produced approximately 411,000 vehicles and delivered nearly 444,000 cars during the second quarter, beating consensus estimates and marking an increase from the first quarter.And despite a year-over-year drop in deliveries, analysts were bullish on the report and pointed to signs the EV industry may be holding up better-than-expected.""We continue to see scope for improving sentiment in Tesla shares as well as broader EV sentiment as compared with the negative sentiment we have seen over the past ~6 months,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note following the results on Tuesday.Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities said in a note the company's deliveries marked a ""major turning point"" in the ""Tesla bull case story.""""The key for Tesla's stock is the Street recognizing that Tesla is the most undervalued AI play in the market,"" Ives wrote, adding that the ""Mojo back for Musk"" as he raised his price target on the stock to $300 from $275 with a new bull case of $400 for 2025.Ives added the company's Robotaxi event on August 8 ""will lay the yellow brick road to [full self-driving] and an autonomous future.""Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas called Tesla's results the ""1st Positive Surprise of the Year,"" noting the automaker delivered 33,000 units more than it produced in the second quarter.The analyst also highlighted a ""show stealer"" from its release ‚Äî Tesla's energy storage business, which posted its highest quarterly deployment yet.

Amid the drama, Paramount announced the departure of CEO Bob Bakish in late April after he was reportedly at odds with Redstone over the Skydance deal.

The idea that job stayer growth would go back to pre-pandemic levels is still being challenged.""In June, wages for job stayers rose 4.9% from the prior year, slower than the 5% pace seen in the prior month and the slowest growth since August 2021. Wages for workers who changed jobs increased 7.7% year over-year, down from 7.8% the month prior and well below the 16.4% seen at its peak in June 2022.Wed, July 3, 2024 at 6:34 AM PDTAlexandra CanalS&P 500, Nasdaq open flat US stocks traded mostly flat on Wednesday ahead of an early close (1 p.m. ET) to trading and a market shutdown on Thursday.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flatline after the benchmark ended Tuesday above 5,500 for the first time.

Three undervalued AI stocks are set up for significant growth in this case. With innovation, profitability, and astute market positioning, each business offers investors a distinctive opportunity inside the semiconductor and technology industries. Starting with the first one, well-known for producing cutting-edge processors that power consumer electronics and data centers, one can understand why the stocks stand out. The next, known for its expertise in data analytics, keeps surprising with its growing commercial presence and profitability.¬†Meanwhile, the last company on the list is causing a stir with its revenue growth in semiconductor manufacturing solutions. With that, there are improvements in operational efficiency. Investigating these three businesses is crucial for investors hoping to profit from equities with solid fundamentals and room to develop. Every company strongly argues for being included in a diverse portfolio aimed at long-term growth. In short, they have supremacy in processor technology, solid business strategy in data analytics, or calculated expansion in the semiconductor markets.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) leads the design and manufacturing of semiconductor and AI products. Indeed, the company‚Äôs client business has driven solid growth. This¬†is because of the high demand and decisive performance of AMD‚Äôs Ryzen 8000 series CPUs. For Q1 2024, the division had sales of¬†$1.4 billion, signifying an 85% year-over-year (YOY) growth. The strong sales of Ryzen desktop and mobile CPUs led to this growth. There is a solid growth potency, as these chips are embedded in devices from¬†major original equipment manufacturers¬†like HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY).Additionally, AMD‚Äôs sharp boost in the client market¬†is mainly based¬†on how its product line incorporates AI capabilities. This strategic integration aligns with the expected expansion of AI in the PC industry. AMD believes that this signals a major turning point. AMD may thrive and expand in the AI PC market because of its partnerships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and more than¬†150 independent software vendors (ISVs)¬†to create AI apps for Ryzen CPUs. Overall, AMD is on the undervalued AI stocks list due to its strong market position in the client segment and vital strategic partnerships.Palantir (PLTR)Source: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.comPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) provides data integration and analytics software solutions for government agencies and commercial enterprises. The company‚Äôs top line was¬†$634 million¬†in Q1 2024, representing a 21% YOY gain. Strong momentum in its government and commercial areas propelled this expansion. In Q12024, Palantir‚Äôs adjusted operating margin increased to 36%, demonstrating the robust unit economics of its business strategy. This margin improvement and sales growth helped the company achieve a Rule of 40¬†score of 57%. This¬†indicates a solid balance between profitability and revenue growth.¬†Moreover, Palantir‚Äôs US commercial business had a solid growth rate. In Q1 2024, revenue from the US commercial division increased by 40% YOY to¬†$150 million. Several factors helped to fuel this expansion. These are significant increases in the number of customers (69% YOY) and Total Contract Value (TCV), with $286 million booked in Q1 (a 131% YOY gain). The company can grow its current clientele and draw in new ones. This¬†demonstrates the versatility and potency of its offerings, such as the AI Platform (AIP).To sum up, Palantir is on the undervalued AI stock list for its constant profitability and expanding customer base.ACM Research (ACMR)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) provides equipment and services for semiconductor manufacturers. To begin with, in Q1 2024, the company‚Äôs top line from single wafer cleaning increased to¬†$109.5 million. There has been a massive 199% gain against Q1 2023. With that, ACM‚Äôs operating margin increased to 26.2% from 14.7% in Q1 2023. This enhancement¬†is based¬†on operational leverage, economies of scale, and efficient cost management over operations. As a proportion of sales, total operating expenditures dropped from¬†41.9% to 35.4%,¬†indicating increased operational efficiency.Further, ACM has¬†a CapEx¬†of $25.4 million for Q1 and an estimated¬†$100 million¬†for 2024. This¬†demonstrates the company‚Äôs focus on growing its facilities, especially in Lingang, Shanghai. The company is also improving its operating capacities in¬†important¬†markets such as the US and Korea. ACM‚Äôs expanding worldwide footprint¬†is reflected in its strong acceptance and favorable feedback from foreign markets, including the US, Europe, and Asia, and its¬†important¬†ties with major semiconductor manufacturers in China, Korea, and other countries. Finally, ACM Research was included in the undervalued AI stocks list due to its rapid revenue growth and strategic¬†expansion¬†in¬†key¬†global markets.As of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in AMD, PLTR and ACMR.

For card not present (online) transactions, the caps will remain 1.15% for debit cards and 1.5% for credit cards,"" it said.Visa and Mastercard set and charge interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, to merchants which accept their debit and credit cards.

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.New YorkCNN        ¬†‚Äî¬†                With interest rate cuts on the backburner, Wall Street is looking to corporate earnings to continue powering the 2024 stock market rally.                Analysts polled by FactSet expect second-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies to grow about 8.7% on average from the prior year. That would mark the fourth-straight quarter of annual earnings growth for the benchmark index.                Strong corporate earnings have helped the S&P 500 gain a whopping 16% and notch repeated record high closes this year. That‚Äôs despite sticky inflation during the first quarter pushing interest rate expectations further out. While data in recent months has signaled that inflation is cooling again, the Federal Reserve penciled in just one interest rate cut for 2024 at its June policy meeting.                Investors are now forecasting up to three cuts, but at the beginning of the year, they were projecting up to six or seven.                Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday at a central bank policy forum in Sintra, Portugal, that prices are back on a ‚Äúdisinflationary path.‚Äù But he maintained that the central bank needs to see more data before easing rates.                Since the Fed isn‚Äôt likely to cut rates anytime soon, the onus is on strong corporate earnings to continue driving the market rally. High interest rates tend to weigh on stocks, since they increase corporate borrowing costs and make virtually risk-free government bonds more attractive.                ‚ÄúEarnings growth will be key to holding, or potentially building on these gains,‚Äù wrote Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in a Monday note.                Earnings season kicks off July 12 when big banks including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup report results. Investors will watch for clues about the health of the consumer. Recent economic data and warnings from retailers have signaled that lower- and middle-income Americans are tightening their purse strings.                The June jobs report, due Friday, will give investors insight into the strength of the labor market. Preliminary data Tuesday revealed that job openings unexpectedly jumped higher to 8.14 million in May, suggesting the labor market remains resilient in the face of sky-high rates.                Investors will also keep close tabs on results from mega-cap tech stocks, whose blockbuster returns account for much of the market‚Äôs gains this year. Shares of Nvidia, the leader of the pack, are up 159% in 2024 after reaching a $3 trillion market cap for the first time in June. Microsoft shares are up 23% and Meta Platforms shares have jumped 44%. Shares of Amazon, which joined the $2 trillion club last month, are up 30%.                Wall Street is looking for signs that these companies‚Äô balance sheets match their lofty valuations. The S&P 500‚Äôs total return for the first half of the year, including dividends, is 15.3%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. Without Nvidia‚Äôs gains, the index‚Äôs total return is 10.7%.                ‚ÄúHigh valuations will also need to be defended from rising uncertainty around monetary and fiscal policy, domestic and international elections and geopolitical conflict,‚Äù wrote Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a Monday note.        How Japan‚Äôs newest yen note came from the Nepali mountains            Banks across Japan began stocking their ATMs on Wednesday with shiny new yen notes sourced from an unlikely location ‚Äî vibrant yellow flowering paperbush shrubs that grow on craggy Himalayan mountains in Nepal.                Before entering the wallets of Japanese consumers, the yen notes had a long, complex journey involving months of labor and transport by land and air across thousands of kilometers, report my colleagues Jessie Yeung, Hanako Montgomery and Junko Ogura.                And this process has offered a potential new source of income to communities in one of the world‚Äôs poorest countries, by providing cash for one of its richest.                Though Japan has pushed for more digital payments in recent years, cash still reigns king, and it trails behind other Asian countries like China that have gone almost completely cashless.                ‚ÄúI really think that Nepal contributed to Japan‚Äôs economy, as cash is fundamental to the Japanese economy,‚Äù said Tadashi Matsubara, president of Kanpou, the company that produces paper for the Japanese government.                ‚ÄúWithout Nepal, Japan would not function.‚Äù    Read more here.        Chinese government bonds are on fire. That‚Äôs ringing alarm bells in Beijing            Money is rushing into Chinese government bonds, sending their prices soaring and yields plunging to record lows as investors hunt for a safer alternative to the country‚Äôs ravaged real estate market and volatile stocks, reports my colleague Laura He.                The yield on China‚Äôs onshore 10-year government bond, which is a benchmark for a wide range of interest rates, touched 2.18% this week, the lowest since 2002, when records began. Yields on 20-year and 30-year bonds are also hovering around historic lows. Bond yields, or the returns offered to investors for holding them, fall as prices rise.                Lower borrowing costs should be welcome in an economy struggling to recover from a property crash, sluggish consumer spending and weak business confidence. But the sharp move in bonds is sparking talk of a bubble and triggering acute anxiety among China‚Äôs policymakers, who fear a crisis similar to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last year.                The People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) has issued over 10 separate warnings since April about the risk that a bond bubble could burst, destabilizing financial markets and derailing the Chinese economy‚Äôs uneven recovery. Now it‚Äôs doing something unprecedented ‚Äîborrowing bonds to sell them to tamp down prices.                ‚ÄúSVB in the United States has taught us that the central bank needs to observe and evaluate the situation of the financial market from a macro-prudential perspective,‚Äù PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng said at a financial forum in Shanghai late last month.

ecZEmUZH6iAxRSW,Seeking Alpha,google,Ethereum Becomes Inflationary (Again): What It Means For Investors (ETH-USD),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702548-ethereum-becomes-inflationary-again-what-it-means-for-investors?source=google_editors_picks,2024-07-05 07:34,2024-07-05 07:37,ETH,,"Peter Hansen/iStock via Getty ImagesThesis I view Ethereum's (ETH-USD) recent switch from a deflationary supply to an inflationary supply as a neutral development for investors. While inflation will dilute investors over time, it also allows for lower transaction fees. This will lead to increased usage of Ethereum, which could lead to more demand and higher Ethereum prices. I remain bullish on Ethereum in the long term. Ethereum's Changing Supply   ychartsThe above chart showing Ethereum's supply over the past year appears quite volatile at first glance. There have been periods of inflation, deflation, and relative stability. However, since April, the supply has been steadily inflating. Fortunately, zooming out to a 5-year chart shows that the supply has actually been quite stable since Ethereum's switch to proof of stake in late 2022. The recent bout of inflation barely registers on a chart that includes pre-2022 data:   ychartsWhile the current inflation rate may be small, it's still worth discussing because it had a clear cause that wasn't just temporary volatility. Specifically, the Dencun upgrade went live in March 2024. This ""hard fork"" upgrade released nine different improvements. One of these improvements - proto-danksharding - is responsible for the recent supply inflation. Proto-Danksharding & Transaction Fees Proto-danksharding reduces fees for ""layer 2"" transactions that are bundled together before being added to the Ethereum blockchain. This is because it allows some data associated with a transaction to be deleted after about 18 days instead of being stored permanently on the Ethereum blockchain. Specifically, some data which is needed to initially validate and process a transaction doesn't need to be stored permanently. This data is redundant with more space-efficient data (such as validator attestations) that's available once the transaction is finalized. In other words, proto-danksharding is simply a means of allowing Ethereum users to temporarily sync some important data without storing it permanently on the blockchain. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum transactions have variable fees that are higher for transactions which require more permanent space on the blockchain. By reducing the amount of permanent storage each layer 2 transaction uses, proto-danksharding has lowered transaction fees for layer 2 Ethereum transactions. Ethereum's Supply Rules Those who are unfamiliar with Ethereum's supply rules may not immediately see the connection between transaction fees falling and Ethereum's supply increasing. After all, Bitcoin's supply rules are more well-known, and they simply allow a fixed amount of new Bitcoin to be issued at regular intervals that were determined in 2009. Ethereum's supply rules are more complicated because the overall supply varies based on multiple factors including transaction fees. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum issues some new supply to reward validators who secure the network. The specific amount of new supply issued varies depending on how much Ethereum is staked by validators. To offset this new supply, some of the transaction fees paid by Ethereum users are ""burned"" or destroyed. If transaction fees are high enough, the Ethereum being burned will more than offset the amount of new supply issued. This leads to a deflationary supply. On the other hand, if transaction fees are low, then the amount of Ethereum burned will be lower than the amount of new supply issued to validators. This results in an inflationary supply. When proto-danksharding caused a large drop in transaction fees, it reduced the amount of Ethereum being burned. In turn, this caused Ethereum's recent supply inflation. Impact on Ethereum Users Lower transaction fees should be a net positive for Ethereum users because it reduces the overhead cost of performing transactions. This makes transactions more cost-effective overall, and is especially impactful for frequent and low-value transactions.   ychartsThe above chart shows Ethereum daily transactions over the past year. Overall, it's been very stable at about 1.1 million transactions per day - even after the Dencun upgrade in March. However, this doesn't mean the Dencun upgrade failed. The above chart only considers ""layer 1"" transactions, which are pretty much capped at this point due to space constraints on the Ethereum blockchain. The Dencun upgrade targeted ""layer 2"" transactions, which bundle many users' transactions into a single ""layer 1"" transaction to save space and reduce transaction fees. There are many ""layer 2"" networks built on top of Ethereum, but we can see that the most popular ones began processing significantly more transactions starting in March:   theblock.coAs shown in the above chart, Arbitrum's average daily transaction volume more than doubled from less than 1 million transactions before the Dencun upgrade to over 2 million afterward. Base experienced an even larger increase and recently processed over 3 million transactions in a day. While that's still only about 1% of the volume of a large payment processor like MasterCard, it's an impressive increase in a short amount of time. Based on these metrics, we can conclude that the Dencun upgrade's lower transaction fees have already been a net positive for Ethereum users. Thanks to these lower fees, people can transact more frequently and economically. Impact on Investors Ethereum's current inflation rate is negligible from an investment perspective. While Ethereum technically used to be deflationary, it was barely noticeable; Ethereum's overall supply has fluctuated by less than 1% since 2022's switch to proof of stake. And since the March Dencun upgrade, Ethereum's supply has inflated by only 0.1%. That's less than 1% inflation on an annual basis, which is lower than the average inflation rate of traditional stores of value like gold and silver. Moreover - unlike with gold, silver, or even Bitcoin - investors can stake their Ethereum to earn a yield that offsets inflation. Even if one uses an expensive centralized staking service like Coinbase, they should be able to earn about a 2.5% annual yield. This is more than enough to offset 1% supply inflation. Even those who don't stake their Ethereum could theoretically benefit from the Dencun upgrade if lower transaction fees lead to more demand for Ethereum. This increased demand could offset dilution from inflation. Considering its relatively stable supply, the Ethereum bull thesis has always been more about increased adoption (and perhaps weakness in the USD) than about deflation. While the switch to inflation should theoretically have little to no impact on the Ethereum bull thesis, investors are not always rational. After Ethereum was marketed as a deflationary asset for the past two years, some investors may view the switch to inflation as a failure of their investment thesis. At a minimum, it's fair to say that Ethereum's supply rules are proving to be more complex and unpredictable than some investors might have expected. For example, while Ethereum could end up being deflationary again in the future if users place significantly more transactions, it's virtually impossible to predict if or when this will happen. Conclusion  Ethereum's switch from deflation to inflation is an interesting development that's worth understanding. This article showed how Ethereum's supply works and why the Dencun upgrade caused it to become inflationary. However, in the big scheme of things, this is a relatively minor development that shouldn't change the long term outlook for Ethereum bulls. Bulls should instead turn their attention towards larger developments such as new functionality enabled by the Dencun upgrade, plans for similar upgrades in the future, and the upcoming Ethereum ETFs.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
uml6M9FL3CzWFrA,Seeking Alpha,bing,Altria: 3 Things You Need To Know About This 9% Yielding Dividend Aristocrat,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702091-altria-3-things-you-need-to-know-about-this-9-percent-yielding-dividend-aristocrat,2024-07-05 07:29,2024-07-05 07:38,NVDA,,"DeagreezAltria (NYSE:MO) is a beloved dividend aristocrat, a dividend king with a 54-year dividend growth streak. In a year when the market's gains have come from a handful of companies, many investors worry about market bubbles. Visual CapitalistThe Terrific Ten generated 76% of the market's 14.5% gains in the first half of the year, while the S&P 490 is up 3.5%. But guess what? It's always and forever a market of stocks, not a stock market. Altria Is Beating The Nvidia (NVDA) powered S&P YChartsIn a year when almost nothing can beat the Nvidia-powered S&P, Altria is beating the market. Altria has been one of the most outstanding stocks in history, delivering 173,000X returns, adjusted for inflation, over nearly a century. Is this a sign that Altria's prolonged bear market is ending? Is Altria's bull run just getting started? Or is this incredible year-to-date rally a sign that Altria has run ahead of fundamentals and income investors should be cautious? Here are three facts income investors need to know about this 9% yielding dividend aristocrat and one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. Fact One: Altria's Long-Term Thesis Remains Solid Altria's entire thesis is about one thing: A smoke-free future transition plan. British American (BTI) shocked the industry with a $31.5 billion writedown, effectively telling investors and analysts on the conference call that it expects the value of its US brands to be zero by 2053. And that doesn't mean MO and BTI have 29 years before the US cigarette market might be zero. In the risk section, I'll discuss the FDA's plans for forcing smokers to get their nicotine fix in non-cigarette forms. FactSet Research Terminal All 16 analysts covering MO believe it will grow at the low end of management's 4% to 6% guidance range, delivering 12% to 13% long-term total returns. Sales are expected to remain stable through 2028 as falling volumes are offset by price hikes and growth in reduced-risk products (RRPs). Altria  Altria Altria bought NJOY in March of 2023 for $2.75 billion-plus $500 million in potential contingent payments. It's the only FDA-approved vaping product portfolio. After the disastrous write-off of Juul and Cronos (both purchased at peak valuations), Altria wants to take a more conservative approach to RRPs. It wants to leverage its distribution channel of more than 140,000 nationwide stores and believes that it can significantly boost NJOY's market share and sales. Altria The initial rollout of MO's NJOY growth plan is promising, though don't get too excited. PM is over 33% of RRPs, BTI is over 15%, and MO's 2028 sales are expected to be 17%. Altria on! is growing strongly, with 32% volume growth in the last year, far faster than the oral tobacco market.   GrandViewResearchGrand View Research Estimates that the $1 billion US nicotine pouch market will grow to $7.3 billion by 2030. Outside of the US, $16 billion in sales are expected by 2030. So the US remains the No. 1 market for nicotine pouches, and MO plans to dominate this industry, which PM's Zyn currently dominates. Altria on!'s market share is gradually rising, making up 7.1% of oral nicotine. The bond market and rating agencies are very confident that Altria's smoke-free transition plans will succeed. Not only is the company's solid investment grade credit rating potentially set for an upgrade in the coming years, but its fundamental risk of default, as shown by its credit default swaps, has been showing falling fundamental risk for the last six months.   FactSet Research Terminal The bond market is confident that Altria will still be healthy in 2061, long beyond the point when British American estimates US cigarette sales will be near zero. FactSet Research Terminal  Fact Two: Altria's SWANiness In Turbulent Markets Is Legendary Altria is a relatively low-volatility, defensive, recession-resistant stock. But when we examine Altria's track record through the last eight bear markets, every one since 1982, we truly get an appreciation for its legendary SWANiness.

Its median bear market decline of 9% is a fraction of the declines of 60-40, showcasing the power of a defensive dividend king that is one of the most shareholder-friendly in history. FactSet Research Terminal MO is expected to ramp up buybacks to $3 billion annually, approximately 5% share repurchases. That makes the 4% EPS growth consensus both more realistic but also a potential warning for investors (see risk section). Fact Three: Altria Is Still A Potentially Strong Buy Dividend Kings Zen Research TerminalAltria is only growing 4% per year, yet thanks to a multi-year bear market, it's a coiled spring that's still a potentially strong buy that offers very powerful short- to medium-return potential. This legendary dividend king is trading at 11.2 EV/FCF, a free cash flow yield of 9%, 3X more than the S&P. That's after the big return this year. That's how undervalued this stock was. At its 52-week low, Altria traded at 9.5X EV/FCF, with a free cash flow yield of 10.5%. Pacer FundsFree cash flow yield is the No. 1 valuation metric of the last 33 years. Pacer FundsAltria remains a coiled spring, just one with positive momentum. Altria Could Potentially Triple In The Next Five Years FAST Graphs, FactSetAltria is only growing 4% per year, and yet, thanks to a multi-year bear market, it's in a terrific position to deliver an awe-inspiring 23% annual return potential for the next five years. For context, that's similar to the consensus return potential of Nvidia. But with a very low-risk yield of nearly 9%. FAST Graphs, FactSetIn the next 2.5 years, Altria, if it grows as expected, 4% per year, and returns to a historical fair value of about 14X earnings, could double, delivering 30% annualized returns. That's on par with Peter Lynch, one of the greatest investors in history. Risks To Consider: Why Altria Isn't Right For Everyone Why don't I own it if I'm so bullish on Altria? Why don't I plan to own it? Altria takes the risk profile of British American (BTI), which I do own, and cranks it up to 11. There are three significant risks to Altria in the next decade. FDA Menthol Ban The FDA's proposed ban primarily targets menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars. The ban does not currently extend to vaping products or other reduced-risk products like heat sticks. The FDA recently authorized four menthol vaping products manufactured by NJOY, marking the first approval of non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes. The FDA's timeline for banning menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars has faced several delays: The rules were initially proposed in April 2022. The original target for finalizing the rules was August 2023, pushed to March 2024. The latest delay could potentially push the decision beyond the November 2024 election. But while the US government is dragging its heels or merely being incompetent, other states and cities are moving quickly. More than 380 localities across 13 states and Washington, D.C., have passed restrictions on flavored tobacco products. Some states, like New York, are considering legislation to ban all flavored tobacco products, including menthol. California most notably has banned menthol, triggering a thriving black market and consumers buying menthol cigarettes in Nevada. All this has hurt MO and BTI's volumes in recent months, and both companies are trying to get regulators to crack down on non-regulated rivals. The menthol ban in the EU went into effect in May 2020 and was partially responsible for BTI's flat sales and -3% EPS growth that year. The menthol ban is not an existential risk to MO's dividend or thesis, but it might reduce the growth outlook by 1% to 2%, which would then mean a 10% to 11% return potential, which might not be attractive enough for some. MO investors' yield might drift higher, making it more difficult to earn the 12% to 13% total return guidance target. FDA Nicotine Regulation The FDA is working on a rule to establish a maximum nicotine level in cigarettes and certain other combustible tobacco products. This regulation aims to reduce nicotine in these products to minimally or non-addictive levels. The current plan does not apply to vaping products, e-cigarettes, or other reduced-risk products like heat sticks. A 2018 FDA paper projected that this regulation could result in more than 33 million people not becoming regular smokers and potentially save more than 8 million lives from tobacco-related illnesses. The FDA initially planned to issue the proposed rule in May 2023. As of February 2024, the FDA stated that finalizing this rule remains a top priority, but no specific date has been set. As of February 2024, the FDA reported that they have made ""tremendous progress"" toward finalizing the rule. The proposed rule has been submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review, a necessary step in the regulatory process. The good news is that this doesn't apply to RRPs like vaping or heat sticks. The bad news is that Altria is far behind the ball on RRPs. It's playing catch-up, around five years behind BTI and about 15 years behind the PM, regarding its guidance for what percentage of sales will be RRPs by specific dates. The trouble is that when the FDA finally does ban menthol and decreases nicotine levels in Marlboro's, MO needs to be able to transition customers to full-nicotine RRPs, or else its brand will count for nothing. While the brand is powerful, the truth is that nicotine addiction is about nicotine. Initially, 50% reduced nicotine in Marlboro might theoretically cause volumes to increase, as smokers smoke twice as much. However, the volume declines we've seen due to high inflation are a sign that consumers are becoming financially stressed and simply unable to afford their favorite brand of cigarettes. Thus, while the multi-year transition to non-addictive nicotine levels in cigarettes is not an existential threat in the next few years, by 2030, Altria's growth prospects might have dimmed to 0% to 2% if MO can't execute with near flawless precision on its RRP portfolio. Analysts expect MO to be 17% RRPs by the end of 2028. Market Share Gains Don't Translate Into Volume Growth Altria BTI has noted that illegal (non-regulated) vaping products have been hurting its US RRP portfolio, and I would say the same is true for MO. Market share has risen as much as 100% in the last year, yet volumes are flat. Altria While it's true that the government is starting to crack down on illegal vaping products, it's still a drop in the bucket and, thus far, hasn't helped MO. And that's with nearly 150% growth in distribution points. Even with another 100% potential growth in distribution points, the fact that volumes aren't soaring is troubling. Thus far, its execution has been somewhat underwhelming, to put things generously. These are also risks to BTI, given that 46% of BTI sales are currently from the US. But while the FDA could potentially hurt BTI's growth prospects, it could kill MO's growth prospects. Altria BTI is optimistic that volume declines will stabilize in the second half of the year. They had better because 9% volume declines will make revenue growth challenging. Altria's volume declines are running at double-digits for several quarters now. The company has some minor diversification, but cigarettes will remain the most important, at nearly 90% of revenue by 2028."" - Morningstar Morningstar, most analysts, and management expect volume declines to be 5% by the end of 2024. If that's true, then 1% to 2% sales growth from cigarettes could buy MO more time to establish its RRP portfolio. That would give MO more runway, but if volume declines continue, 2% to 3% sales declines in cigarettes will pressure MO's EPS growth. Remember that 4% EPS growth is the consensus, factoring in 5% share reductions. If volume declines are 5% higher than expected, 4% EPS growth could become -1%. And that would make the dividend unsustainable at some point, many years from now. And potentially require a 13% to 14% yield for income investors to want to own this company. While the consensus is for MO to be 17% RRPs by 2028, Morningstar is more pessimistic, assuming just 10% sales in four years. For comparison, BTI is expected to be almost 30%, and PM is expected to be 60%. While the dividend won't come under risk for many years, even in the worst-case scenario, remember that yield + growth = total returns. If management is guiding for 4% to 6% long-term growth, and the market values MO at 8% to 9%, if growth prospects were to fall to 0% to 1%, then the yield might have to drift higher (or spike there through falling share price) to 10% to 12%. Modest growth of 2.75% is what management is guiding for, below the 4% to 6% long-term growth guidance. Altria If MO completes its transition, investors will make money, even buying at today's post-rally price. However, the returns might be a lot more muted than the current return potential guidance. BTI expects the US cigarette market to be zero by 2053. MO has until then to make the transition to a 100% smoke-free future. Bottom Line: Altria's Rally Is Justified By Fundamentals Altria is a great company, a dependable income source, and one of the safest 9% yields on Wall Street. The rally is 100% justified by fundamentals, and Altria has a strong upside in the next 2.5 to five years (90% to 215%, respectively). If you're comfortable with the risk profile and believe that management can transition to a smoke-free future by 2053, this might be one of the best dividend aristocrats you can buy today. Altria is a perfect example of how the stock market is always and forever a market of stocks, not a stock market. Are you tired of hearing how Nvidia only goes up? Buy deep value like British American or Pipelines. Are you scared of buying a value trap? Then Altria is a value stock with red-hot momentum.  Growth, value, momentum, or some combo of all three, there are countless ways to buy wonderful companies and harness the genius of global capitalism to live your dreams. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dividend Kings helps you determine the best safe dividend stocks to buy via our Automated Investment Decision Tool, Zen Research Terminal, Daily Blue-Chip Deal Videos, and much more!√Ç¬†Membership also includesAccess to our 13 model portfoliosFull access to my $3 million family charity fund, including real-time trade notifications.√Ç¬†50% discount to iREIT (our REIT-focused sister service)√Ç¬†real-time chatroom supportnumerous valuable investing tools√Ç¬†Click here for a two-week free trial.

VOhMUVZXs4LUFiE,Seeking Alpha,google,"Google: The Cheapest Stock In The ""Magnificent 7"" (NASDAQ:GOOG)",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702546-google-alphabet-cheapest-stock-in-magnificent-7,2024-07-05 07:25,2024-07-05 07:39,GOOGL,,"400tmax Investment Thesis Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) GenAI roadmap since early this year has fueled a strong rally in its stock. From Gemini 1.5 to AI Overviews, the company is integrating GenAI features into all its products and services. I believe that GOOGL's valuation will largely depend on the success of its AI monetization strategy, which has already shown early success in the last earnings report. In my previous analysis, I upgraded the stock from hold to buy, driven by early signs of an online advertising recovery in July 2023. Since then, the company has experienced significant growth in Google Search and YouTube ads revenue, leading to a 40% stock rally, beating the S&P 500 index's 20% gain. The recent rally did not significantly increase its P/E multiple, supported by an average 54% YoY increase in its EPS over the past three quarters. This suggests there is still potential for further upside in its valuation. Therefore, I reiterate my bullish view on the stock, driven by the anticipated 50% year-over-year increase in capex in FY2024 to sustain its top-line growth and margin expansion in the long term. Accelerating AI Monetization Last year, Google Search integrated with GenAI, helping users efficiently reach the content they wanted. Now, the company is adding a new Gemini model to make Google Search more intellectual. In addition, Google Search users in the U.S. can now get quick answers with AI Overviews, which was introduced in May. The management expects to reach over a billion users by the end of CY2024. The company model The 1Q FY2024 earnings results beat all market consensus. It was encouraging to see a continued growth acceleration in Google Search revenue, which comprised 57.3% of its total revenue in the last quarter. I believe the GenAI monetization in Google Search has materialized, as segment revenue growth improved significantly to 14.4% YoY in 1Q FY2024 from 1.9% YoY in 1Q FY2023, boosting the company's total revenue by 15.4% YoY. This indicates that the pace of GenAI monetization is faster than the market expected. Shorts is a Key Growth Driver for YouTube Ads Statista Now, let's look at another positive signal. The YouTube ads segment has shown a strong rebound in growth, driven by both direct response and brand advertising, surpassing the 20% YoY threshold for the first time since 4Q FY2021. As GOOGL is approaching the two-year anniversary of the launch of ads on YouTube Shorts, the company has started to focus more on its monetization. According to Statista, YouTube Shorts users are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% from 2023 to 2027. While this growth rate is not significant, the company is working on its monetization strategy to improve ads revenue growth. In the earnings call, the management discussed how YouTube Shorts monetization continues to improve as AI drives higher ROI. Like most AI features from TikTok, YouTube Shorts previously introduced Dream Screen, allowing users to create AI-generated backgrounds for their short videos. Impressively, the number of channels uploading shorts grew 50% YoY last year. The monetization rate of shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the past 12 months in the U.S., which, I believe, will be a key growth driver of its ads revenue in the future. Strong Margin Expansion Improves Earnings Outlook   The company model Next, we move on to its cloud business. In 1Q FY2024, Google Cloud revenue grew 28.4% YoY, showing further acceleration from 25.7% YoY in the previous quarter, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. This growth trajectory appears more robust compared to Amazon's (AMZN) AWS, which grew 17.2% in 1Q FY2024, slightly up from 15.8% YoY in 1Q FY2023. Over the past three years, Google Cloud's EBIT margin has been expanding, which is a positive sign, combined with its revenue growth rebound. Meanwhile, significant expansion in Google Services' EBIT boosted the company's overall EBIT margin to 31.6%, the highest since 3Q FY2021. This led to a 61% YoY increase in the company's GAAP EPS in the last quarter, marking a further acceleration from 56% YoY in 4Q FY2023. I admit that the margin expansion was partly due to a YoY decline in operating expenses, but we still saw a strong top-line growth, which could justify an expansion in valuation multiples. 52% YoY Increase in Capex on AI Infrastructure in FY2024   The company model We should know that all growth comes with a cost. As shown in the chart, GOOGL's capex as a percentage of total revenue has been increasing since 3Q FY2023. In 1Q FY2024, capex grew almost 100% YoY to $12 billion. Management expects quarterly capex throughout the year to be roughly at or above $12 billion. If we assume $12 billion in each of the next three quarters of FY2024, the total capex in FY2024 is expected to grow 52% YoY to $48 billion, up from $32.3 billion in FY2023. When an analyst asked Ruth Porat, the President & CIO of the company, about the recent uptick in capex despite GOOGL's long-term investment in AI, she implied it was largely due to the Gemini foundation model. They also expect investment in office facilities to be less than 10% of total capex in 2024. Therefore, I believe that GOOGL will maintain its current growth trajectory through significant investments in GenAI and continued monetization of AI innovations over the long term. Valuation Seeking Alpha Despite the stock reaching an all-time high recently, I believe GOOGL is still currently undervalued. It is currently trading at 28.5x GAAP P/E TTM, mostly in line with its 10-year average. This multiple is even slightly below the S&P 500 index's P/E TTM of 28.7x. According to Seeking Alpha, its non-GAAP P/E forward is trading at 24.8x, which is 4% below its 5-year average. Given GOOGL's growth rebound in its core advertising business and strong margin expansions under increasing capex on AI innovations, its non-GAAP P/E forward is the lowest among the ""Magnificent 7"" (including Meta's (META) 25.4x, MSFT's 39x, AMZN's 43x, NVDA's 47x, TSLA's 97x, and AAPL's 33.6x). Therefore, I believe GOOGL is the most undervalued AI play among the ""Magnificent 7"" and has plenty of upside potential from the current price level. Conclusion  In summary, GOOGL is leveraging its GenAI monetization strategy to drive significant growth across its product ecosystem. This move has already spurred a strong rally in its stock, supported by significant growth in earnings, boosted by accelerated revenue growth in Google Search and YouTube ads. We also saw a continued margin expansion in Google Cloud. Despite recent stock highs, GOOGL remains the most undervalued stock in the ""Magnificent 7"" in terms of its non-GAAP P/E fwd, trading at 24.8x and poised for further upside as it continues to innovate and invest heavily in AI infrastructure in FY2024. Therefore, I maintain my buy rating on the stock.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

jm2sHZLvA7TQBsb,The Motley Fool,google,1 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stock to Buy Right Now,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/05/1-no-brainer-warren-buffett-stock-to-buy-right-now/,2024-07-05 08:00,2024-07-05 08:01,JPM,,"Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway fully owns businesses in a wide variety of industries. But the sprawling conglomerate also has a gargantuan $394 billion public equities portfolio as well, headed by the Oracle of Omaha. Investors would be wise to peek at Berkshire's holdings to find potential portfolio ideas. There are dozens to consider. However, here's one no-brainer Warren Buffett stock to buy right now.A credit card leaderThe company I'm talking about is American Express (AXP -0.11%). It's currently the third-largest holding for Berkshire, with the conglomerate owning a sizable 21.1% stake in the financial services entity.American Express (also known as Amex) is undoubtedly a leader in the industry. It offers various credit cards known for their high fees and attractive perks. For example, the Platinum card costs $695 per year but comes with numerous travel and lifestyle benefits. The brand is key to the company's success, as it can help bring in affluent consumers who spend more.Like JPMorgan Chase or Capital One, Amex is a card issuer that extends credit to consumers for purchases. But unlike these banks, and similar to Visa and Mastercard, Amex also operates the underlying payments network that helps to facilitate transactions. This gives the business a unique competitive position.Consequently, Amex also possesses network effects. The more cardholders who become customers, the more valuable Amex is to the merchants who accept it as a method of payment. And with more acceptance locations, the value proposition of being a cardholder increases.Financial performanceHelped by this economic moat -- a top characteristic Buffett likes to see in his businesses -- Amex has been reporting strong financial performance. This is another reason the stock looks like a no-brainer buy.The company posted revenue (net of interest expense) of $60.5 billion in 2023, which was up 14% year over year. What's very encouraging is that Amex makes money in various ways. It not only earns meaningful interest income on its cardholders' balances but also charges fees to consumers and merchants.This is a consistently profitable enterprise, which greatly reduces financial risk. Net income jumped 11% in 2023 before rising 34% in the first quarter of 2024.Of course, any business that lends money is exposed to the economic cycle. While Amex has proven to be resilient, a recession could lead to higher losses. For what it's worth, management expects revenue and earnings per share to rise¬†10% and 15% (both at the midpoint), respectively, this year, both of which would be stellar outcomes.Looking at valuationBerkshire Hathaway has owned shares in American Express since the early 1990s. In the Oracle of Omaha's mind, this appears to be a so-called forever stock, one that he supposedly doesn't have any intention of selling anytime soon.Prospective investors should consider the valuation. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.3, slightly higher than the trailing-five-year average of 18.6. This seems like a reasonable entry point, in my opinion.It's important to understand that because Amex is both a card issuer and payment processor, its P/E multiple should be between that of JPMorgan Chase and Visa. And this is exactly what holds true today. Investors benefit from a long-running dividend that currently yields 1.2%. That might not be anything to write home about, but it has risen over the years. Moreover, executives engage in stock buybacks. In the past five years, the outstanding share count has been reduced by more than 14%, boosting earnings per share.Once you understand the positive attributes of this business, it's easy to see why the stock is a no-brainer buy.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suffice to say, he‚Äôs recorded albums as a vocalist, created two classic stand-up specials (‚ÄúDelirious‚Äù and ‚ÄúRaw‚Äù), made voicing a donkey cool (‚ÄúShrek‚Äù), won a Primetime Emmy for his ""Saturday Night Live"" hosting return, was given the Mark Twain Prize for humor, and is the proud father of 10 children.Judge ReinholdReinhold, 67, rocketed to fame on the heels of his likable if befuddled police officer in ‚ÄúBeverly Hills Cop,‚Äù boasting a pal-next-door appeal that would later be claimed by actors such as Jason Segel. While Reinhold tried to parlay that success into leading roles, his movie ‚ÄúVice Versa‚Äù was a flop. Reinhold returned to his supporting role niche, both in the ‚ÄúCop‚Äù sequels and the Tim Allen star vehicle series ‚ÄúThe Santa Clause.‚ÄùMany TV fans may best know Reinhold for his 1994 Emmy-nominated ‚ÄúSeinfeld‚Äù stint, in which he played a ‚Äúclose talker‚Äù (someone who stands uncomfortably close during a conversation) who develops an unnatural affection for Jerry‚Äôs parents.John AshtonAshton, 76, was another working actor whose role in ‚ÄúBeverly Hills Cop‚Äù made him suddenly recognizable. But nevertheless, his bread and butter would remain character roles in a long string of movies and TV shows over the subsequent decades.While his most high-profile non-Taggart role was that of a rival bounty hunter in the cult classic movie ‚ÄúMidnight Run,‚Äù Ashton spent nearly 40 years, from 1974 to 2012, appearing in countless TV series, including ‚ÄúKojak,‚Äù ‚ÄúWonder Woman,‚Äù ‚ÄúM*A*S*H,‚Äù ‚ÄúDallas‚Äù and ‚ÄúLaw & Order: SVU.‚ÄùBronson PinchotPinchot, 65, made a name for himself shortly out of Yale, the year before ‚ÄúCop‚Äù came out, when he appeared in the Tom Cruise classic ‚ÄúRisky Business.‚Äù His performance as the outrageous and wildly accented art dealer in ‚ÄúCop‚Äù then led to memorable appearances in movies such as ‚ÄúAfter Hours,‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue Romance‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe First Wives Club.‚ÄùWhile he has largely been away from Tinseltown‚Äôs spotlight in the past decades, Pinchot has made a name for himself as an audiobook narrator, with some 400 plus titles to his credit so far, ranging from Flannery O‚ÄôConnor novels to the ‚ÄúMemoirs of General William T. Sherman.‚ÄùPaul ReiserReiser, 68, is another actor who before ‚ÄúCop‚Äù appeared in a now-classic film, 1982‚Äôs ‚ÄúDiner.‚Äù His success in Murphy‚Äôs cop comedy eventually led to NBC greenlighting a sitcom Reiser co-created, ‚ÄúMad About You‚Äù (1992 to 1999), in which he co-starred with Helen Hunt as his onscreen wife. While that series won a host of awards, 2011‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Paul Reiser Show‚Äù lasted but a few episodes.Reiser is less known for his considerable musical skills.

Despite that, the largest public Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) has remained steady over the same period with its stock up 2% since the beginning of June. Earlier this week, Marathon, as well as its competitors Riot (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK), released their June Bitcoin production updates. All of those companies have seen their production decline YoY due to the halving event that occurred last April. However, Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs update had some promising updates as it mined the most Bitcoin among its peers, increased its industry leading HODL stash, and had the best mining efficiency in terms of its revenues per exahash. In my previous coverages on Marathon titled √¢¬Ä¬úMarathon Digital: The Bitcoin Miner To Own Before Halving And Elections√¢¬Ä¬ù and √¢¬Ä¬úMarathon Digital: A Potential Key Cog In Post Halving Bitcoin Mining√¢¬Ä¬ù, I was bullish on the stock due to its high exposure to Bitcoin price in light of its HODL stash and its efforts to diversify its business model by selling its technology to other Bitcoin miners. My bullish thesis remains in place as Marathon continued its diversification efforts by venturing into mining Kaspa (KAS-USD). I believe this new venture could have substantial benefits to Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs future financial performance due to the high margins associated with mining Kaspa. Meanwhile, the current divergence in the price action of both Marathon and Bitcoin could signal a significant run in the near term. Such a run in both Bitcoin and Marathon could be fueled by the upcoming presidential elections, as I shared in my first coverage on Marathon, as well as a potential decline in mining difficulty due to hashprices being at an all-time low. As such, I√¢¬Ä¬ôm reiterating my buy rating for Marathon. Improving Mining Efficiency Last June, Marathon mined 590 Bitcoin at a production rate of 19.7 BTC/day. In comparison, Riot mined 255 Bitcoin at a rate of 8.5 BTC/day and CleanSpark mined 445 Bitcoin at a rate of 14.8 BTC/day. On a YoY basis, Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs production declined 40%, Riot√¢¬Ä¬ôs production declined 45%, while CleanSpark√¢¬Ä¬ôs production only declined by 9%.

However, the minimal 9% decline in CleanSpark√¢¬Ä¬ôs production is mainly attributed to its hashrate√¢¬Ä¬ôs exponential growth from June 2023. Compared to June 2023 levels, Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs operational hashrate increased 102% from 13 EH/s to 26.3 EH/s, Riot√¢¬Ä¬ôs operational hashrate increased 90% from 6 EH/s to 11.4 EH/s, while CleanSpark√¢¬Ä¬ôs operational hashrate increased a whooping 204% from 6.7 EH/s to 20.4 EH/s.

At the same time, Marathon had a cash balance of $268 million at the end of June, while Riot and CleanSpark had cash balances of $323 million and $688.5 million, respectively, as of March 31st. Accordingly, each company√¢¬Ä¬ôs cash balance in addition to their respective Bitcoin stashes have the following values at 1 BTC = $58,889.71.

In June, Bitcoin had an average price of $65,899, a slight increase from $65,266 in May. Accordingly, Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs revenues in June could be around $38.9 million compared to Riot√¢¬Ä¬ôs $16.8 million and CleanSpark√¢¬Ä¬ôs $29.3 million. In this way, Marathon, Riot, and CleanSpark, generated $1.48 million, 1.47 million, and $1.44 million respectively per each operational hashrate as the following table shows.           MARA RIOT CLSK   Revenue $38,880,685 $16,804,364 $29,325,263   Operational Hash Rate 26.3 11.4 20.4   Rev/EH $1,478,353 $1,474,067 $1,437,513   Click to enlarge In my opinion, Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs better mining efficiency compared to its peers is especially promising due to the record low hashprice of $0.04 per TH/s that has led Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs average hashrate to decline over the past few weeks. As a result, small, unprofitable miners have unplugged from the Bitcoin network, paving the way for large, efficient miners to grow their production with less competition in the network. Based on this, it is expected that mining difficulty could decrease by 5% this week, which could boost hashprice in the coming weeks.   Hashrate IndexDiversification Efforts On June 26th, Marathon announced a new venture to further diversify its business model after making its technology available for other Bitcoin miners. The company announced that it is mining Kaspa, the fifth largest proof-of-work digital asset with a market cap of $4.14 billion, as of July 4th. Marathon has already purchased 60 petahashes of miners to mine Kaspa, and these miners can generate margins of up to 95% based on Kaspa√¢¬Ä¬ôs network difficulty rate and price. Currently, the company has 30 petahashes deployed and plans to deploy the remaining petahashes in Q3 2024. As of June 25th, Marathon had mined 93 million Kaspa valued at $15 million, implying an average price of $0.1613. In my opinion, this new venture will boost Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs topline as well as its bottom line due to the high margins of mining Kaspa. According to Minerstat, Marathon could mine around 1,441,635 Kaspa per day once all 60 petahashes are deployed, compared to 720,834 at the current 30 petahashes. Given that Marathon anticipates the full deployment of all 60 petahashes in Q3, I expect it to mine around 99,473,587 Kaspa during the quarter. My forecast is based on 92 days in Q3 and a 30 PH/s run rate for half of the quarter and 60 PH/s for the other half of the quarter.      Q3 Production  Half at 30 PH 33,158,368   Half at 60 PH 66,315,220   Total Q3 Prod 99,473,587   Click to enlarge At Kaspa√¢¬Ä¬ôs current price of $0.1661, Marathon could generate revenues of $16.5 million in Q3 from mining Kaspa. Meanwhile, the company could generate $22 million in Q4 from mining 132,630,439 Kaspa at 92 days in the quarter and Kaspa√¢¬Ä¬ôs current price. Assuming that Q1 generally has 90 days, Q2 has 91 days, and Q3 and Q4 have 92 days, Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs 60 PH/s run rate could see it mine 526,196,852 Kaspa next year at the current mining difficulty.       KAS Production/Day 1,441,635   KAS Q1 Production 129,747,169   KAS Q2 Production 131,188,804   KAS Q3 Production 132,630,439   KAS Q4 Production 132,630,439   KAS Prod/Year 526,196,852   Click to enlarge Therefore, at Kaspa√¢¬Ä¬ôs current price, Marathon could generate $87.4 million in revenues from this endeavor alone.       KAS Rev/Day $239,428   Kas Q1 Rev $11,677,245,201   Kas Q2 Rev $11,938,181,174   Kas Q3 Rev $12,202,000,417   Kas Q4 Rev $12,202,000,417   KAS Annual Rev $87,391,299   Click to enlarge It should be noted that these figures differ from actual results depending on Kaspa√¢¬Ä¬ôs price movement. Bitcoin Price Movement In addition to the fundamentals, looking at Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs and Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs respective charts, it appears that both the stock and Bitcoin could witness a strong upward movement in the coming weeks. First thing to look at in both charts is that whenever Bitcoin formed lower highs and lower lows, while Marathon maintained its trend, a strong rally in both Bitcoin and Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs stock occurred as shown in the following charts.   TrendSpiderNote that Bitcoin is currently forming lower highs and lower lows on the daily timeframe, while Marathon is maintaining its neutral trend.   TrendSpiderThe same can be seen in 2021 when Bitcoin was moving in a downward trend while Marathon maintained its trend. In the following weeks, both Bitcoin and Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs stock climbed 113% and 230%, respectively, from their levels when Bitcoin broke its downward trend.   TrendSpiderThe same happened again in mid-2023 when Bitcoin formed lower highs and lower lows, while Marathon maintained its sideway channel. In the following weeks, Bitcoin and Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs stock climbed 21% and 90% respectively from their levels when Bitcoin broke its downward trend.   TrendSpiderA potential Bitcoin rally could be supported by the TrendSpider chart above showing the correlation between Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs price action and the crypto fear and greed index. The green circles on the chart above highlight that whenever the fear and greed index tests the neutral zone, Bitcoin rallies, which is the case at the moment.   TrendSpiderMeanwhile, the chart above shows that Marathon has successfully broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern with a retest of the trendline. This could be a sign of a strong upward movement in the near term. Risks The main risk to my thesis is Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs price action. While the technicals and the expectations of lower mining difficulty due to the record low hashprices might signal an upward movement in the cryptocurrency√¢¬Ä¬ôs price in the coming weeks, Bitcoin could continue its downward trend, especially if June√¢¬Ä¬ôs non-farm payroll data, scheduled for July 5th, are negative as this could decrease the chances of the Fed cutting interest rates this year. Moreover, Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs venture into mining Kaspa may not provide the forecasted results if the cryptocurrency performs poorly. Conclusion In summary, I remain bullish on Marathon following its June Bitcoin production update that highlighted its efficiency in terms of its revenues/EH, which was better than its largest competitors Riot and CleanSpark. This could be a promising sign for Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs future financial performance thanks to the expectations of mining difficulty declining by 5% in light of the record low hashprices that has driven out inefficient miners. Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs new venture into mining Kaspa to diversify its digital assets could also lead to high returns thanks as it could generate around $87.4 million in annual revenues at extremely high margins of up to 95%. Meanwhile, the divergence between Marathon and Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs price movements could signal a strong rally for both Bitcoin and Marathon√¢¬Ä¬ôs stock, considering the historical data. Such a potential run is further supported by Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs price action relative to the fear and greed index, as well as Marathon breaking out of its symmetrical triangle chart pattern. In light of these factors, I√¢¬Ä¬ôm reiterating my buy rating for Marathon.  Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

PtuqUVhPe3SWCAG,CNBC,google,Mt. Gox begins repaying bitcoin to creditors a decade after exchange's collapse ‚Äî what it means,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/05/mt-gox-begins-repaying-bitcoin-to-creditors-a-decade-on-from-collapse.html,2024-07-05 08:30,2024-07-05 08:34,BTC,,"Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET The trustee for Mt. Gox, the Japanese¬†bitcoin¬†exchange that collapsed into bankruptcy a decade ago, said on Friday that the company has begun to make payments in bitcoin and in bitcoin cash to some of its creditors.The announcement goes on to say that repayments to other users of the hacked exchange would be ""promptly made"" once a certain set of conditions has been met.Customers of the Tokyo-based exchange have been waiting 10 long years to get their money back.  The trustee for Mt. Gox, the Japanese¬†bitcoin¬†exchange that collapsed into bankruptcy a decade ago, on Friday said that the company has begun to make payments in bitcoin and in bitcoin cash to some of its creditors.The announcement added that repayments to other users of the hacked exchange would be ""promptly made"" if they meet certain conditions, including undergoing account verification, as well as subscribing to one of the designated digital asset exchanges through which the bankruptcy estate is facilitating disbursements in digital tokens.""We ask eligible rehabilitation creditors to wait for a while,"" continues the statement.The price of bitcoin has plunged nearly 6% in the last 24 hours.Customers of the Tokyo-based exchange have been waiting 10 years to get their money back. Once the world's largest crypto trading venue, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in February 2014 after a series of heists that saw up to 950,000 bitcoin ‚Äî worth upward of $58 billion at today's prices ‚Äî vanish. Mt. Gox blamed the bitcoin disappearance on a bug in the cryptocurrency's framework. While users were receiving incomplete transaction messages when accessing the exchange, coins may have actually been illicitly moved by hackers out of their accounts, Mt. Gox said.After declaring bankruptcy, 140,000 of the missing bitcoin were recovered ‚Äî which means that roughly $9 billion worth of bitcoin will be returned to owners, in today's prices. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $600 at the time of the bankruptcy. Today it's worth over $54,000 ‚Äî an almost 9,000% increase.According to data from Arkham Intelligence, on Thursday and Friday, Mt. Gox moved billions of dollars in bitcoin from its crypto wallets ahead of the repayment memo.Over 47,000 bitcoins worth $2.7 billion were moved out of an offline cryptocurrency wallet associated with Mt. Gox, Arkham Intelligence said Friday.A portion of the funds, worth $84.9 million, was sent to Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank, which is listed among the platforms supporting repayments to Mt. Gox users, according to Arkham. A further $63.6 million of bitcoin was sent to an unknown counterparty, which Arkham said was ""likely a listed repayments exchange.""Mt. Gox wallets continue to hold 138,985 bitcoins, worth around $7.5 billion at current prices, according to Arkham, meaning that billions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency are still yet to be paid out. Analysts previously told CNBC they expect the Mt. Gox repayment plan to lead to some heavy selling in bitcoin, although this is likely to be short-lived and precede further price gains later this year and in early 2025.John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lending firm Ledn, told CNBC the windfall for Mt. Gox users would likely translate to huge sales in bitcoin as investors look to lock in gains.""Many will clearly cash out and enjoy the fact that having their assets stuck in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy was the best investment they ever made,"" said Glover, who was previously a managing director at Barclays. ""Some will clearly choose to take the money and run,"" he said in emailed comments.JPMorgan analysts said in a note last month that they expect Mt. Gox customers to sell some of their bitcoin to profit from seismic gains for the cryptocurrency.""Assuming most of the liquidations by Mt. Gox creditors take place in July, [this] creates a trajectory where crypto prices come under ... pressure in July, but start rebounding from August onwards,"" they wrote.Ultimately, the total sum owed to creditors ‚Äî some 140,000 bitcoins ‚Äî accounts for roughly 0.7% of the total 19.7 million¬†bitcoin currently in circulation.Analysts say this means that, even though it's likely to impact prices, there's enough liquidity available to cushion the blow of any intense selloff.James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, told CNBC that the billions of dollars' worth of bitcoin being traded on trusted exchanges daily this year suggests that ""liquidity is sufficient to absorb these sales over the summer months.""Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, echoed that point, saying the markets are more than capable of absorbing the selling pressure.""Moreover, a healthy part of the creditors are likely to take a 10% haircut on their holdings to receive the repayment early, and not all holdings are set to be liquidated on the open market, reducing the overall selling pressure,"" he told CNBC by email.",0.0,True,"The trustee for the collapsed Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt.

p02B2jH0FyMiWwi,Techcrunch,google,Amazon faces more EU scrutiny over recommender algorithms and ads transparency,https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/05/amazon-faces-more-eu-scrutiny-over-recommender-algorithms-and-ads-transparency/,2024-07-05 08:37,2024-07-05 08:42,AMZN,,"In its latest step targeting a major marketplace, the European Commission sent Amazon another request for information (RFI) Friday in relation to its compliance under the bloc‚Äôs rulebook for digital services. The development highlights areas where EU enforcers are dialling up their scrutiny of the ecommerce giant, with the bloc asking for more info about Amazon‚Äôs recommender systems, ads transparency provisions and risk assessment measures.An earlier Commission RFI to Amazon, last November, focused on risk assessments and mitigations around the dissemination of illegal products; and the protection of fundamental rights, including in relation to its recommender systems.The EU‚Äôs Digital Services Act (DSA) puts requirements on platforms and services to abide by a series of governance standards, including in areas like content moderation. In the case of online marketplaces the law also requires they implement measures to enable them to take action to tackle risks around the sale of illegal goods. While larger marketplaces, such as Amazon, have an additional layer of algorithmic transparency and accountability obligations under the regime ‚Äî and this is where the Commission RFIs are focused.The additional rules have applied on Amazon since the end of August last year, following its designation by the EU as a very large online platform (VLOP) in April 2023. It‚Äôs the Commission‚Äôs job to enforce these extra obligations on VLOPs.While it remains to be seen if the latest Commission RFI to Amazon will lead to a formal investigation of its DSA compliance the stakes remain high for the ecommerce giant. Any confirmed violations could get very costly as penalties for breaching the pan-EU law can reach up to 6% of global annual turnover. (NB: The company‚Äôs full year revenue for 2023 was $574.8 billion, meaning ‚Äî on paper at least ‚Äî its regulatory risk runs into double figure billions.)Detailing its action in a press release, the Commission said it‚Äôs sent Amazon an RFI related to measures it‚Äôs taken to comply with DSA rules related to the transparency of recommender systems and their parameters. It also said it‚Äôs asking for more info about Amazon‚Äôs provisions for maintaining an ad repository ‚Äî another legally mandated transparency step for larger platforms. The Commission also said it wants more detail about Amazon‚Äôs risk assessment report. The DSA requires VLOPs to both proactively assess systemic risks that might arise on their platforms and take steps to mitigate issues. Platforms also need to document their compliance process. ‚ÄúIn particular, Amazon is asked to provide detailed information on its compliance with the provisions concerning transparency of the recommender systems, the input factors, features, signals, information and metadata applied for such systems and options offered to users to opt out of being profiled for the recommender systems,‚Äù the EU wrote. ‚ÄúThe company also has to provide more information on the design, development, deployment, testing and maintenance of the online interface of Amazon Store‚Äôs Ad Library and supporting documents regarding its risk assessment report.‚ÄùThe EU has given Amazon until July 26 to provide the requested info. After that any next steps will depend on its assessment of its response. But failure to respond satisfactorily to an RFI could itself trigger a sanction.Last year the EU named online marketplaces as one of a handful of priority issues for its enforcement of the DSA‚Äôs rules for VLOPs. And it has looked attentive to the area. Late last month it sent separate RFIs to rival marketplace VLOPs, Shein and Temu ‚Äî soon after designating the pair. Although, in their case, the Commission‚Äôs RFIs also raised concern about illegal goods risks and manipulative design (including as a potential child safety risk), as well as asking them for more information about the operation of their own recommender systems.  Why so much interest here? Algorithmic sorting has the power to influence platform users‚Äô whole experience by determining the content and/or products they see. In a nutshell the EU wants the DSA to crack open such blackbox AI systems to ensure commercial agendas ‚Äî to grab attention and/or drive more sales ‚Äî aren‚Äôt the only thing programming these automated decisions as a tool to guard AI-driven societal harms, such as platforms pushing content that‚Äôs harmful for people‚Äôs mental health or recommending shoppers buy dangerous products. Amazon is unhappy about the regime. Last year it challenged its DSA designation as a VLOP. And last fall it won an interim stay on one element of VLOPs‚Äô DSA compliance ‚Äî namely the requirement to publish an ads library. However, in March, the EU General Court reversed the earlier decision, overturning the partial suspension.‚ÄúFollowing its designation as a¬†Very Large Online Platform¬†and the Court‚Äôs decision to reject Amazon‚Äôs request to suspend the obligation to make¬†its advertisement repository publicly available, Amazon is required to comply with the full set of DSA obligations,‚Äù the Commission wrote. ‚ÄúThis includes diligently identifying and assessing all systemic risks relevant to its service, providing an option in their recommender systems that is not based on user profiling, and have an advertisement repository publicly available.‚ÄùGiven Amazon has spent money on lawyers to try to argue why it shouldn‚Äôt have to comply with the DSA ads library element ‚Äî and the subsequent overturning of the stay ‚Äî it‚Äôs not too surprising this is one of the areas where the Commission is seeking more information now. The EU was contacted with questions. We also reached out to Amazon for a response to the Commission‚Äôs RFI. A company spokesperson emailed TechCrunch this statement: ‚ÄúWe are reviewing this request and working closely with the European Commission. Amazon shares the goal of the European Commission to create a safe, predictable and trusted shopping environment. We think this is important for all participants in the retail industry, and we invest significantly in protecting our store from bad actors, illegal content, and in creating a trustworthy shopping experience. We have built on this strong foundation for DSA compliance.‚Äù",0.0,True,"The European Commission has sent Amazon another request for information (RFI) related to its compliance with the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), focusing on areas such as recommender systems, ad transparency, and risk assessment measures.

Lake, who is the CEO of Consumer & Community Banking in the firm and runs the Chase Bank, said the bank is already planning to charge customers for a number of now-free services in response to new proposed rules that would limit overdraft and late fees.  Chase Bank serves more than 82 million consumers and six million small businesses in the country. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had finalized a rule that would lower the typical late fee allowed by card issuers to $8 from $32 earlier this year. However, a U.S. district court judge temporarily stopped the rule from coming into effect in May after being moved by bank industry groups. Lake believes the new rules that would cap overdraft and late fees will make everyday banking significantly more expensive for all Americans, the report added. Federal agencies are pushing more rules to cap fees paid by customers, including limiting debit card fees further and charge caps for fintech companies to access and use bank customers' data.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) I reiterated my hold rating because the stock was in a bearish trend and was trending towards my support zone of about $117. Since my coverage, the stock declined about 29% from $195.33 to about approximately $138 which still falls around the support zone as will be illustrated later, and rebounded where I had recommended short positions within the $117 and $281 price range. While the recent bounce on the support zone and the upward trajectory on the stock could mark the onset of a long-term bullish trend, I still hold some reservations about opening a long-term position here because, from a technical point of view, the long-term outlook is neutral. In addition, the company is still facing some headwinds especially its production and delivery woes, which unless they subsidize don√¢¬Ä¬ôt support a long-term upward trend. The major long-term bullish catalyst that I am monitoring closely is its diversity beyond the EV market through the introduction of autonomous vehicles and the launch of the robotaxi business. According to estimates, the robotaxi would yield an annual revenue of $700 billion and Optimus would yield an annual revenue of $1 trillion. The combined revenue contribution would see a triple effect on Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs current revenue, which would be a massive growth. Looking at these optimistic estimates alongside the projected CAGR of 80.8% for robotaxi between 2022 and 2030, as well as the projected 52.8% CAGR of the global humanoid robot market size between 2023-2030, it is indisputable that these are major long-term growth levers if implemented effectively. While I recommend close monitoring of the developments in these projects, I have several data points and insights that I believe we can look forward to gathering from the robotaxi unveiling event in August which include:  Design of the new robotaxi Autonomous technology such as details on whether it will use a camera-only sensor suit or incorporate other technologies. Information on how the company plans to navigate the state and local regulations for autonomous vehicles, which are essential for the deployment  These among other common insights such as potential production and release dates should form the scope of our evaluation of the developments of this company's long-term growth projects. Until these projects are fully operationalized and prove their potential in revenue contribution, I believe TSLA is a hold. Technical Take TSLA bounced on the upper side of the support zone, and it is currently in what I see as a short-term to midterm bullish trend which could reverse when it hits the $281 price mark which is a potential resistance zone. However, should there be a strong catalyst, the price could break above this range and that could mark the onset of a long-term upward trajectory with a price target of about $400 as shown below. Trading View With these defined target zones, let√¢¬Ä¬ôs dive deeper and assess the potential price action based on technical indicators. First off, the price has gone above the 50-day and 100-day MAs a sign that the stock is currently bullish in the short and midterm horizons. However, the two MAs are currently at the same level where a golden cross is possible, which will be a confirmation that this current bullish momentum is sustainable. In addition, the 200-day is currently at par with the price, a sign of a neutral long-term outlook. Above all, the 200 MA recently crossed above the 100-day and 50-day MAs which is a death cross and that could usher in a potential bearish trend. With this mixed outlook, I believe a hold decision is justified as we look for a clear direction from the MAs. Market Screener To support my hold decision, the RSI is currently at 66.9 slightly below the overbought region of 70 where a trend reversal is likely. Above all, the Schaff trend cycle shows that the currently bullish momentum is peaking and it is likely reversing. To me, this implies that the stock could reverse at the $281 mark which is a short-term pivot point, and most likely retest the support zone before a long-term bullish trend. Market Screener In summary, TSLA is exhibiting a mixed technical signal which warrants a hold decision. Most importantly, the long-term outlook is neutral and my buying decision will only be informed by major catalysts such as the launch of the robotaxi business or the unveiling of the autonomous vehicles. Otherwise, the mixed signal and the current woes leave me cautious. Current Woes: Why I am Cautious Tesla has been experiencing production and delivery challenges as competition intensified (For a detailed analysis of the competitive landscape refer to my previous analysis). To put it in perspective, the company reported its second quarter of YoY production and delivery decline. It reported producing 410,831 vehicles for the three months ending in June 2024, a 14% decrease from the corresponding number of 479,700 vehicles in Q2 of 2023. Deliveries decreased 4.7% from 466,140 in 2023 to 443,956 in Q2 2024. The annual decrease carries over the pattern that began in Q1, when deliveries dropped to 386,810, an 8% year-over-year dip, as the market for electric vehicles slowed down globally. The corporation made a roughly 10% staff reduction as a result of this, which in my view shows the extent of its current headwinds. While the decline can be partly attributed to the slowdown in the global market, intensifying competition in my view is a major concern. My concern is that, despite Tesla's declining production and delivery trajectory, which indicates a decline in consumer demand for its goods, rival BYD announced second-quarter battery EV sales that increased by almost 21% year over year to 426,039 units, as reported by CNBC. In my view, the growing competitor√¢¬Ä¬ôs output while Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs is shrinking implies that it could be seizing its market share to its competitors, a reason I believe is fueled by BYD offering cheap options to Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs products. It is even worse to see that EV sales are projected to decline from 60% in 2022 and 31% in 2023 to 21% in 2024 and 19% in 2025. This declining adoption of EVs points out a bleak market outlook at a time when Tesla appears to be losing the race to its competitors, something which forced them to cut prices to match the competition. The declining deliveries are a testament that the strategy hasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt paid off. Consequently, I foresee a scenario where its financial performance could keep declining due to lower prices and lower sales volumes. This will translate to lower margins and eventually lower stock prices unless the scenarios improve. While Tesla opted to price cut to catch up with BYD, the latter has adopted a price war in response which implies that the competition ought to go beyond just price wars because it is apparent that BYD is winning here and this proves to be detrimental to TSLA as shown by the declining sales compared to BYD. To demonstrate how BYD is winning the price battle, it debuted its first ""medium-sized urban smart electric SUV,"" the Sea Lion 07, in May. BYD's new electric SUV undercuts Tesla's best-selling Model Y, which starts at 249,900 Yuan ($34,550) in China, with a starting price of 189,800 Yuan ($26,250). In summary, I expect the recent woes to persist because it will be almost impossible to curb BYD√¢¬Ä¬ôs growing threat, which I believe could soon see it surpassing Tesla sales in the EV market and become the next EV giant if it keeps innovating affordable products. Above all, I believe Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs underwhelming production and delivery output against BYD√¢¬Ä¬ôs will lead to reduced investor confidence, which could turn to bearish sentiments. One More Thing: My Expectations for Q2 2024 Tesla is expected to release its Q2 2024 earnings reports on 23rd July 2024. In my view, this upcoming quarterly report will exhibit a mixed performance given that the company has seen its vehicle deliveries and production levels decline YoY as discussed above which implies that its revenue may experience a hit following these low deliveries and its price-cutting strategies. However, I expect the effects of this low output in the automotive segment to be partially offset by the energy generation and storage segment which has reported the highest quarterly storage of 9.5 Gwh in Q2. Given these dynamics, I expect a negative net effect both on the revenues and profits where revenue will be in the region of $90 billion compared to $94 billion in Q2 2023 and EPS will be in the region of $1.49 compared to $1.52 billion in Q2 2023. This will reflect the effects of the price cuts and low deliveries reported this quarter. My Final Thoughts  In conclusion, Tesla is still plagued by production and delivery headwinds, which reflect the weakening demand for its products. This happens amidst its competitor's overwhelming performance on this front, which implies that it could be losing the market to its competitor, especially BYD. Despite its attempt to cut prices to match competition, BYD has adopted a price war in response and it appears that Tesla is losing this war. Given this intensifying competition and bleak market outlook, I am cautious to invest here until TSLA fully implements its robotaxi and Optimus projects, which could liberate it from its recent struggles. For these reasons and the mixed technical outlook, I recommend patience here.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

2ueqfs9RwuFa7f5,Seeking Alpha,google,Cloudflare: Apple Intelligence And Workers AI Opportunities (Rating Upgrade) (NYSE:NET),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702560-cloudflare-apple-intelligence-and-workers-ai-opportunities-rating-upgrade,2024-07-05 09:04,2024-07-05 09:08,AAPL,,"Sundry Photography Since I last covered Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) on April 5 in my bearish thesis entitled: ""AI Overenthusiasm and Facing Cost Pressures (Rating Downgrade)"", the cloud networking and cybersecurity company is down by around 12% and was trading at $84.53 at the time of writing. Data by YCharts Part of the decline came after the first quarter of 2024 (Q1) financial results, highlighting a rather conservative guidance for the rest of the year. However, things changed after WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) 2024 on June 10 when Apple announced that it would embed Gen AI across its device ecosystem, which implies new sales opportunities for Cloudflare. There has also been progress in monetizing the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs investment in Workers AI. Amid such a background, this thesis aims to show that Cloudflare is a buy, and I start by updating investors on three metrics hinting that cost pressures have become more nuanced compared to three months earlier. Signs of Improvement First, if one takes a closer look at Q1, this was not such a bad quarter after all as revenue was up 30% YoY, beating estimates and the company saw a record number of new customers join the platform. Earnings per share also beat estimates by $0.03. seekingalpha.com More importantly, non-GAAP operating margins of 11.2% represent a slight improvement compared to the prior quarter. Another important development is its non-GAAP gross margins, which also improved sequentially to 79.5% while being up 1.70% YoY. At the same time, the NRR (Net retention rate) was held steady at 115% compared to a deterioration three months earlier. These three metrics had seen slight deteriorations in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the fact that they have either stabilized or improved shows progress. First, gross margins increasing alongside sales shows that the company is not suffering from pricing pressure or having to provide discounts to drive its Workers to AI and other products. Second, this is a company with a strong growth mandate aiming for $5 billion in annual recurring revenue after the appointment of a President of Revenue in February of this year. Amid such a move, marketing expenses normally tend to increase rapidly, and, in such a circumstance, even a slight improvement in operating margins means that Cloudflare is managing to squeeze more profits per every dollar of sales, after accounting for the direct costs involved. Third, again when attempting to boost revenues by signing new customers, it is important not to lose existing ones to the competition for this subscription-based business, especially at a time of uncertain macros triggered by a cocktail of high borrowing costs and still-elevated inflation. As such, certain clients may be tempted to switch to much bigger competitors like Palo Alto Network (PANW) offering bundled products together with free trials. In this case, the company competes with Palo Alto for cybersecurity, namely with its Cloudflare One SASE platform. Hence, NRR stabilizing shows the ability both to retain and expand sales to existing customers, implying that its products remain sticky. Thus, while things have not drastically improved, the company remains on the right track. Still, mainly because of uncertainty-related reasons, the company delivered a conservative outlook for FY-2024, with between $1.648 billion and $1.652 billion of revenues, or 27% YoY growth. However, this could benefit from Apple Intelligence. Could Play a Key Role for Apple Intelligence As announced at WWDC, Apple is setting up a new PCC or Private Cloud Compute IT infrastructure in the context of including AI features into its device ecosystem. Up to now, Apple has been cramming more and more computation into the iPhone, iPad, or iMac. However, the problem for Apple is AI has progressed to the point that mobile devices no longer process the amount of data that is required for models based on Gen AI, especially after its partnership with OpenAI. So to keep pace with rivals like Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) whose apps are driven by Alphabet's (GOOG) Android operating system, Apple has designed a secure cloud infrastructure to convince its customers that their data is safe. In other words, the creation of the PCC is essential so that for securely transferring personal subscriber data to a remote location to interact with AI models, which is in contrast to it being processed locally on their devices. Moreover, to process the data and execute AI models the PCC will entail the use of Apple's silicon, not external servers. However, the issue becomes when devices have to connect to the PCC using the internet, which Apple does not own. To address related security and privacy issues (which fall beyond the PCC boundary), Apple will use RSA Blind Signatures, but this involves an OHTTP (or Oblivious HTTP) relay operated by a third-party provider like Cloudflare. For this matter, the latter already works with Apple to provide the iCloud Private Relay, which provides encrypted two-way communication for existing Safari users to browse the internet privately and securely. Now, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS) who assume that most of the AI queries made for Apple Intelligence will be encrypted through Cloudflare, the company could harvest up to $100 million annually as tabled below for its existing devices.   Table built using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) This assumption is based on 8% of Apple√¢¬Ä¬ôs current installed base of iPhones and iPads which have AI-compatible processors and which will be equipped with Apple Intelligence this fall (September to December). Now, considering that Apple has 2.2 billion active devices, 8% comes to 176 million. Looking further down the line, because of the huge demand for its iPhone 16, up to 100 million devices are expected to be sold next year. Adding to these iMacs for professionals harnessing the power of Apple silicon to leverage Gen AI, I estimate an additional $100 million in terms of new devices sold. Factoring in Workers AI in Cloudflare's Sales Furthermore, the company has seen some success for its Workers AI, which was purchased by a big client as part of a bundle of 40 products and services totaling about $40 million. For investors, Workers AI concerns the inference part of artificial intelligence, whereby developers make use of a model that would have been previously trained to design apps. For this purpose, developers using Cloudflare's platform can browse open-source models from Meta Platforms, Open AI, and Hugging Face, just to name a few. Moreover, with its serverless approach which allows developers to work without having to manage the underlying infrastructure, the company could gain a foothold in the AI inference server market valued at $11.2 billion in 2023 and expected to expand by 18% CAGR by 2030. Assuming less than 1% of $11.2 billion, Cloudflare could reap $100 million annually as shown in the above table. Adding together, I obtained $300 million of additional sales for FY-25 on top of what analysts have been estimating, which leads to a total of $2.41 billion or a growth of 46% instead of the 27% expected. This translates to a lower P/S of 11.92x instead of 13.62x. Conversely, this results in a share price of $96.54 (84.53 x 2.41/2.11) or a 14.2% upside. Table built using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) Therefore, there are opportunities for Cloudflare with AI starting to happen at the network edge after the training phase using expensive GPU clusters in data centers. This was not the case three months ago when there were a lot of talks mainly about developers testing Workers AI but no related deals. Faces Competition for Workers AI and This is a Long-Term Target For this purpose, Cloudflare edge infrastructure is key to making sure AI applications like those designed for providing automated responses for someone calling to know whether an item is available at a store. On the other hand, this way of ""distributing"" AI means Cloudflare which is a CDN (Content delivery network) is adding value to its network with compute and storage features in a way that also puts it in competition with hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN) which is also aggressively building its global networks to cater for AI inference workloads. Therefore, there are risks of a price war erupting between Cloudflare CDN and Amazon CloudFront for ingress fees charged to developers, or the costs associated with data moving to their respective clouds. Along the same lines, investors will note that I have priced in the Apple Intelligence-related opportunities for FY-2025 as WWDC only introduced the concept and the product features are likely to be rolled out over the second half of this year as there is a need for the iPhone maker to execute carefully to avoid the issues, especially around personal data which have plagued AI endeavors by other players. Still, with the market being mostly forward-looking, the stock could rise following a related corporate update and the stock has already gained more than $10 following WWDC as shown below, and this is despite the conservative guidance, which may hint at some investors already pricing in iPhone-related sales. Conversely, expect volatility in case there is unfavorable news, especially in terms of delay. www.seekingalpha.com  Finally, to justify this rating upgrade, the stock is currently trading at a trailing P/S of 20.49x compared to $24.36x when I covered it on April 5 which signifies a reduction of about 15.9%, meaning that its valuation has decreased thereby providing investors with a better margin of safety.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its rating change from ‚Äúbuy‚Äù to ‚Äúneutral‚Äù comes with a set price target of $181.00 for the tech giant‚Äôs shares.The brokerage firm‚Äôs decision to lower Alphabet‚Äôs rating is based on several factors indicating transitional risks. The analysts from Rosenblatt highlighted concerns about the effect of AI in search functions. The particular concern was how incorporating AI Overviews could temporarily reduce search advertising revenues.¬†Furthermore, Alphabet may be losing search market share to competitors like Microsoft‚Äôs (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing. They also pointed to the shift in search advertising revenue toward retail media networks as a potential challenge for Alphabet.¬†Amazon‚Äôs (NASDAQ:AMZN) successful foray into the advertising space is expected to inspire other major retailers, like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), to follow.  Another area of risk identified is the aggressive push by Amazon into video advertising.¬†Amazon‚Äôs plans to make advertisements a default feature on Prime Video and its assertive upfront sales campaign could disrupt the advertising sales landscape for YouTube, which is a significant part of Alphabet‚Äôs business. Lastly, analysts are concerned about the possibility of Alphabet facing a higher-than-anticipated capital expenditure cycle for AI.¬†Nike (NKE)Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comNike (NYSE:NKE) stock attracted a series of analyst downgrades last week following a disappointing earnings report.

Citi downgraded ResMed from ‚Äúbuy‚Äù to ‚Äúneutral‚Äù and reduced its price target to AUD$30.00 from AUD$36.00.The adjustment came after new data emerged from the SURMOUNT study, suggesting that GLP-1 treatments could become a viable option for approximately 70% of obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).Citi‚Äôs analysis indicated that 40-50% of patients on tirzepatide achieved OSA remission. This could lead to a decrease in the demand for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, a market in which ResMed is a key player.¬†While CPAP therapy is expected to be prescribed alongside GLP-1 treatments initially due to a dose escalation period of approximately 20 weeks, Citi anticipates a gradual rebasing of the CPAP device market. Moreover, they expect Philips to regain about 20% of the market share, with 10% potentially coming at the expense of ResMed.¬†Oppenheimer also downgraded ResMed, moving from ‚Äúoutperform‚Äù to ‚Äúperform,‚Äù after the full SURMOUNT-OSA dataset was presented on June 21.

sLvCL8qjrVkT3mD,Seeking Alpha,google,"Finding Bitcoin Support, Eyeing BITB Amid Poor Seasonal Trends (NYSEARCA:BITB)",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702563-finding-bitcoin-support-eyeing-bitb-amid-poor-seasonal-trends,2024-07-05 09:36,2024-07-05 09:44,BTC,,"Arkadiusz Wargu√Ö¬Ça The price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) plunged during light holiday trading shortly after the Fourth of July. The move didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt come out of nowhere, though, as the cryptocurrency was already experiencing selling pressure off its most recent peak above $70,000 in early June. Before the close of the holiday-shortened week on Wall Street, the price of one Bitcoin had dipped under $55,000 √¢¬Ä¬ì a more than 20% pullback in less than a month√¢¬Ä¬ôs time. Investors are left wondering if now is the time to add to a position or wait for a more favorable entry point.  I assert that some patience is needed, but we are nearing critical support. I have a hold rating on shares of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (NYSEARCA:BITB). It√¢¬Ä¬ôs among the smaller spot Bitcoin ETFs, but it has respectable size and is a good proxy for Bitcoin in my view.  Why has Bitcoin pulled back so hard from a fundamental perspective? We can perhaps pin the decline on Mt. Gox, a once-prominent Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange that is now preparing to reimburse creditors after its 2014 bankruptcy with approximately $9 billion worth of Bitcoin. On July 5, 47,000 Bitcoin were moved to another wallet from Mt. Gox. It was Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs fourth straight session of losses.  Bitcoin Plunges Into Early July, Bear Market Territory   TradingView Bitcoin and Stocks Losing Correlation   Bloomberg According to the issuer, BITB allows investors to gain convenient, low-cost exposure to bitcoin through a professionally managed ETF. This may avoid the cost, complexity, and custody concerns of owning Bitcoin directly. Bitcoin has distinct return patterns and historically low correlations to traditional stocks and bonds. As a result, bitcoin can offer long-term diversification and risk management benefits to an overall investment portfolio.  BITB is a moderate-sized ETF with $2.3 billion in assets under management as of July 3, 2024. Its low 0.20% annual expense ratio puts it close to the cost of comparable spot Bitcoin funds, but its share-price momentum has weakened considerably in the past month, now hitting technical bear-market territory. BITB is a highly liquid product given its average daily trading volume of nearly two million shares, while its median 30-day bid/ask spread is narrow at just three basis points, per Bitwise.  What√¢¬Ä¬ôs troubling right now for the Bitcoin bulls is that for the first time since last October, the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs largest cryptocurrency is now under its 200-day moving average. As Grant Hawkridge pointed out this morning, Bitcoin's historical forward returns are not all that rosy when the price falls below the key long-term moving average. This has me concerned about further downside.  Bitcoin: Poor Returns Following A Cross Under the 200dma   Grant Hawkridge Making the weak price action even more worrisome is that it comes as the Bloomberg United States Financial Conditions Index has turned exceptionally loose. Normally, you would expect risky and speculative assets, such as Bitcoin, to perform well amid such lax conditions.  That√¢¬Ä¬ôs not what we are seeing right now. This is a possible tell that if financial markets turn more volatile, then something like Bitcoin could endure even more losses.  Loose Financial Conditions   Kevin Gordon, Schwab Another negative factor? Seasonality. This chart is from Jeffrey Hirsch, and it illustrates that the June through early October period has historically been the worst calendar stretch for Bitcoin in its more than a decade-long trading history.  If we were to follow seasonal trends, then a cautious approach would be prudent during the third quarter. But where is a good place to begin accumulating or adding to an existing Bitcoin position? Let√¢¬Ä¬ôs inspect the chart.  Bitcoin: Bearish Seasonal Stretch Through Early October   Jeffrey Hirsch  The Technical Take   I will begin by assessing Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs chart, and will then translate that into price points on BITB. Notice in the graph below that shares are under the rising long-term 200-day moving average. If price can reclaim that trend indicator line, then much of the bearish sentiment could get wiped away. But if it remains under the 200dma, we have to find potential areas of interest lower from today√¢¬Ä¬ôs $55,000 level.  I see two spots. The first is the 38.2% retracement of the rally from $15,480 in November 2022 to the peak of $73,800 in March 2024. That comes into play near $51,000. I would expect some technical support there. The second area of interest is the $48,000 to $49,100 range √¢¬Ä¬ì that was resistance in early 2022 and again at the beginning of this year. What√¢¬Ä¬ôs more, the cryptocurrency consolidated there before surging to a new all-time high back in February. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs a natural polarity area, so buying there, with a stop depending on your risk tolerance, would make sense.  On the upside, there is now a large amount of volume by price, or bearish congestion, in the $58,000 to $73,000 zone, which will make conditions tough on the bulls. Bitcoin: $51k and $49k May Offer Support, But BTC-USD is Below the 200dma   Stockcharts.com Translating that into price spots on BITB, be on the lookout for support at $28 and $27, respectively.  BITB: Support at $28 and $27   Stockcharts.com  The Bottom Line    I have a hold rating on Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. With higher volatility today and key support about 10% under the latest Bitcoin price, prudence is encouraged to buy the ETF at a more favorable risk/reward price.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
YyXZfK65tu1NSaS,Seeking Alpha,google,Hut 8 Stock: Ample Dry Powder For Bitcoin Mining And AI Vertical Expansion (NASDAQ:HUT),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702565-hut-8-ample-dry-powder-for-bitcoin-mining-and-ai-vertical-expansion,2024-07-05 09:41,2024-07-05 09:52,BTC,,"Oselote HUT 8 Mining Corp. (NASDAQ:HUT) has been one of the mining companies on my radar since the start of this Bitcoin (BTC-USD) market cycle. In my coverage of the stock about ten months ago, I recommended a √¢¬Ä¬úhold√¢¬Ä¬ù - at a time when I gave peers like Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) a √¢¬Ä¬úsell√¢¬Ä¬ù rating. The growing Bitcoin miner appealed to me then because of its strong cash position (strengthened by its BTC holding) and the planned merger with USBTC at that time, though the company faced several downtime issues in that period. My following coverage of HUT 8 was a little over six months ago (in January). In that article, which I titled HUT 8: Diversified Business Appeal, I highlighted how HUT√¢¬Ä¬ôs growing high-performance computing (HPC) business makes the company an attractive Bitcoin miner. I also talked about the miner√¢¬Ä¬ôs low price-to-hash ratio compared to peers, and the more moderate price action the stock had seen compared to peers who had recorded triple-digit percentage gains. The stock is up about 67% on that √¢¬Ä¬úbuy√¢¬Ä¬ù rating. Considering the YTD gain and the current stock price, is there room for more upside for HUT? HUT√¢¬Ä¬ôs Financial and Operations Turnaround Since Asher Genoot became CEO of HUT, there has been some turnaround in the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs operations. In the CEO√¢¬Ä¬ôs own words: √¢¬Ä¬úWe have centered Hut 8 on operating excellence and bottom-line economics.√¢¬Ä¬ù Part of the necessary steps for the company has been the sunsetting of inefficient facilities and products. HUT√¢¬Ä¬ôs facility at Drumheller was shut down in Q1 for being inefficient. In articles, I wrote last month covering CleanSpark (CLSK) and Marathon Digital, I talked about how critical it is for a miner to directly own and control key aspects of its operations at this stage of the Bitcoin market cycle. Since the fourth halving event, a miner√¢¬Ä¬ôs direct control over such key variables has been one of the most important qualitative factors I look for before considering adding a miner stock to my portfolio. MARA now directly owns and controls 54% of its electricity as opposed to just 3% previously, and runs mostly proprietary software and hardware. Bitdeer (BTDR) is moving towards incorporating proprietary hardware and software in its operations. Miners who still rely heavily on third-party providers for resources like electricity and facilities could easily lag in operational efficiency. HUT 8 has moved away from running most of its miners at hosted facilities and now operates its own facilities. Fleets from hosted facilities have been relocated to HUT√¢¬Ä¬ôs own facilities. HUT is also implementing proprietary software that will monitor its energy usage and help the miner attain efficient energy usage. Moving to its own site has lowered HUT√¢¬Ä¬ôs cost to mine BTC due to its lower all-in energy cost of less than $275,000 per megawatt for 63 megawatts of new capacity the miner brought online in Q1. Cost to mine at HUT√¢¬Ä¬ôs own facilities is expected to eventually become 30% lower compared to when the company mainly used hosted facilities. The miner is in the process of developing 1,100 MW of electricity and has ample dry powder to achieve this. HUT√¢¬Ä¬ôs balance sheet remains very liquid. Its 9,102 BTC holding at the end of Q1 resulted in a $276.4 million net income, due to a valuation of its BTC holdings to fair value based on the FASB fair value accounting rule which Bitcoin miners have adopted. Net assets (total assets minus total liabilities) are about three times greater than total liabilities. Total assets are about $1 billion and total liabilities are $258 million. Note that HUT√¢¬Ä¬ôs Q1 balance sheet includes assets from its acquisition of four power plants from entities controlled by Validus Power Corp., earlier this year. What makes HUT's balance sheet more attractive and highly liquid is that its 9,102 BTC holdings, marked at a fair value of around $650 million, make up over 50% of its total assets. The bottom line is that at the moment HUT can comfortably cover its debt obligation, invest in growth opportunities, and have much less need to take on debt with unfavorable conditions. Bottom Line I like the fact that HUT is focusing on electricity capacity expansion to enhance its self-mining. One of the drawbacks HUT has faced in the past has been power surges at some of its facilities, resulting in operational inefficiencies. Challenges with mining operations are about to be a thing of the past for HUT. All indicators suggest that HUT√¢¬Ä¬ôs AI vertical business could commence generating sales soon. HUT has hinted at the high possibility of generating revenue from its AI vertical business in the second half of this year. According to HUT√¢¬Ä¬ôs June operations update, 512 Nvidia H100 GPUs were installed and configured at an HPC data center in June as part of outfitting the data centers to accommodate the new AI infrastructure. One of the perks of holding HUT in a Bitcoin stock portfolio is its much lesser risk of dilution compared to some of its mining peers. I don't see any need for HUT to raise funds through equity in the foreseeable future. It's over 9,000 BTC stash, the recent $150 million Coatue funding to boost its HPC line for its AI vertical business, and its restated $65 million credit facility from Coinbase provide all the dry powder the company would be needing. It is worth mentioning that while HUT doesn't face risk of immediate dilution, there is risk of dilution at some point in the future. The $150 million Coatue funding, for example, was secured through convertible notes.   HUT Golden Cross (barchart.com) From a technical standpoint, HUT√¢¬Ä¬ôs MA50 crossed MA200, forming a Golden Cross last week. The last Golden Cross last year sent the stock soaring 120% in a 60-day period. There is potential for HUT forming a strong uptrend channel and see a similar uptrend after the recent Golden Cross if the current Bitcoin sell-off FUD doesn't impede Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs momentum for too long.   HUT vs BTC price movement 3Y (Seeking Alpha) As seen in the chart above, HUT has majorly mirrored Bitcoin price movements; though there has been some decoupling between HUT and BTC since Q3 last year, HUT remains mainly regarded as a Bitcoin stock and is not immune from the effects of Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs volatility. However, I believe that HUT is one of the Bitcoin stocks that could see a further price decoupling from Bitcoin soon, when the AI vertical business takes full shape and revenue from that segment begins to contribute a significant share to total revenue.  Though the stock is up over 60% since the last √¢¬Ä¬úbuy√¢¬Ä¬ù rating in January, I see more upside potential for HUT based on simple, clear technical indicators and strong qualitative factors.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyst Pierre Ferragu downgraded the dominant manufacturer of semiconductors used in artificial intelligence to neutral, citing limited upside. ""We downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet,"" he wrote Friday, noting that revenue models show growth slowing to a mid-teen rate, with graphics process unit revenues rising only 35% next year. Shares of Nvidia have surged 159% so far this year, building on an AI-fueled rally that kicked off in late 2022 when ChatGPT debuted. But Nvidia has pulled back in recent weeks as investors locked in some profits. Any negative opinion on Nvidia is pretty much unheard of these days on Wall Street. Of the 41 analysts covering the stock, 38 give it a buy rating, while three say it is a hold, according to TipRanks.com . No analysts say it is a sell. There was only one other downgrade of Nvidia from buy to hold this year, by Germany's DZ Bank in May. Given this contrarian outlook, New Street set a $135 price target on Nvidia, assuming a 35 times multiple, in line with its 2019 and early 2020 multiple. The target suggests 5% upside from Wednesday's close. Ferragu added that Nvidia may run the risk of seeing a lower price-earnings multiple, as it currently trades at 40 times the next 12 months' earnings. That multiple bottomed at 20 times in 2019 when growth eased to 10%.

Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $73,803.25 in March this year.Among the largest crypto losses so far this year was the roughly $308 million worth of bitcoin stolen from Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin, in what the company called an ""unauthorised leak"".Cryptocurrency companies are frequent targets for hacks and cyberattacks, although losses of this scale are rare.Stolen cryptocurrency volumes in 2022 were around $900 million, Redbord said, partly due to the more than $600 million stolen from a blockchain network linked to the online game Axie Infinity. The United States has linked North Korean hackers to that theft.The United Nations has accused North Korea of using cyber attacks to help fund its nuclear and missile programs.

WdCSxOV4zJfYa6J,Seeking Alpha,bing,Vestas: Waiting For The Wind To Blow Offshore,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702567-vestas-waiting-for-wind-to-blow-offshore,2024-07-05 09:46,2024-07-05 10:01,XOM,,"claffra/iStock via Getty Images The gloom continues for the wind industry and more so for major offshore wind developments that impact major turbine maker Vestas (OTCPK:VWDRY) and more so offshore wind project developer Orsted (OTCPK:DNNGY). Vestas, the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs biggest turbine manufacturer, has had an up and down 12 months, being down 11.5% year on year, while Orsted is down 41.4% year on year. My take on this is that we are at a key inflection point where action on climate change (or lack of it) is nearing a point of no return. All kinds of political events are conspiring against the wind industry but climate emergencies make clear what happens without substantial action. Here I present how I see the situation and why I see opportunity for Vestas. A critical time for addressing emissions Last year√¢¬Ä¬ôs COP28 meeting produced some significant pledges by delegate countries to get serious about addressing the urgent climate issues. The COP28 Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge, which was signed by 133 countries, acknowledged the need to increase significantly emissions reducing efforts between 2023 and 2030. The pledge was for trebling renewables (more than 11,000 GW) by 2030 and doubling the annual rate of energy efficiency improvements (from 2% to 4%/year until 2030). COP29, to be held in November 2024 in Baku Azerbaijan, a noted oil & gas producer, has a tough job to implement the COP28 pledge. Initial steps don√¢¬Ä¬ôt seem promising as three journalists were intimidated and turned away (after being accepted to participate) from an energy industry conference last week in Baku, Azerbaijan. Baku Energy Week included a 2-day forum sponsored by BP (BP), TotalEnergies (TTE), Uniper (OTCPK:UNPRF) and leading oil & gas figures. One can see increased activities by the oil and gas industry to counter climate actions, with Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Shell (SHEL), BP, the American Petroleum Institute and US Chamber of Commerce accused of √¢¬Ä¬údeceptive practices√¢¬Ä¬ù to √¢¬Ä¬úentrench use of fossil fuels√¢¬Ä¬ù misleading the general public and collaborating with academic and trade groups seeking to build credibility, while knowing the information presented was misleading. One doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt need to look far among the Seeking Alpha community to get a sense of how successful the fossil fuel industry has been in sowing doubt about the extreme position that humanity is currently in. Renewables are clearly a way of addressing the problem, but solutions also require exit from fossil fuels. Prominent oil & gas companies are clear that they do not have responsibility to address greenhouse gas emissions and they plan expansion of fossil fuel production. Offshore wind is powerful, reliable and its timing complements solar PV power generation. It seems to me that delaying and minimising wind power has drawn particular interest from the oil & gas industry. And the efforts have been successful. Big picture on the revolution in power generation Sometimes it helps to take a high level view of the progression of a revolution, because one sees issues that get lost in the undergrowth. An excellent example is an interview with Bill Nussey where he discusses the issues involved in local (rooftop solar PV) and big end of town power generation (large scale solar, wind, gas, coal, nuclear) which involve government and monopoly. His comparison with the evolution of the computer, the cloud and internet makes for compelling watching. It is a √¢¬Ä¬úchatty√¢¬Ä¬ù interview but well worth spending an hour on. I found it gave me a different perspective concerning my renewable energy investments. The computer and mobile phone revolutions tell us about the amazing results one gets when you perfect devices by manufacturing lots of them. Solar PV is the energy medium that parallels the computer chip, and it comes as no surprise that solar PV is rapidly becoming the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs biggest energy source. So much for oil never being replaceable! The thing is that wind has interesting production characteristics and the technology to make power from it with big turbines translates from the oil & gas industry, especially offshore. BP pauses offshore wind activities Perhaps as a result of booming oil & gas prices, some oil & gas companies are pulling back from renewables initiatives. Very recently BP√¢¬Ä¬ôs new CEO Murray Auchincloss is taking decisive action on major renewables initiatives by the company, specifically relating to a major push by former CEO Bernard Looney into offshore wind. This plays into my observation that the fossil fuel industry is finding it hard to exit its problem molecules. How serious is the pushback against offshore wind? For some time now, attacks on wind have been stepping up, now only by right wing politicians in the US and Europe, but also by company CEOs. Exxon Mobil√¢¬Ä¬ôs (XOM) CEO Darren Woods is particularly dismissive of the suggestion that power will be decarbonised largely by wind and solar. His view is that finding substitutes for oil & gas is hard because the scale is enormous, the cost astonishing and he has no real sense of exiting oil & gas ever. His focus is on molecules when the solution involves electrons. He ignores the scale of renewable energy developments. The thing is that scaled solutions for power generation and management are available now and offshore wind is a key part of the solution. Reality is intruding Climate issues are becoming so intrusive that emissions reduction initiatives such as from COP28 (see above) are now becoming more concrete. Perhaps this is why the pushback is so strong. The global balance is shifting. Once, if the US and Europe didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt agree with an initiative, that meant the end of it. Today, regardless of what the US and Europe think, China and India are determined to address their emissions problems through massive renewables programs. This is also switching the axis of change to Asia. One sees this currently with electrification of transport, where China (and India coming) is gaining control of the momentum for dramatic change and exit from the ICE (Internal Combustion Engine). The US (Europe?) is trying to stop this momentum, but it isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt clear that they can. The result is that US loses influence. Europe is actually making huge progress in managing the crisis which arose as Russia stopped supply of its natural gas. In the first half of 2024 the EU exceeded 50% of its power from renewables and for Germany, the figure was 65% renewables in its grid. Wind made a major contribution powering 34% of Germany√¢¬Ä¬ôs grid. Where does Vestas fit?  Vestas is Denmark√¢¬Ä¬ôs 7th most valuable company. As one might expect for a Danish company, Vestas is conservatively managed and one gets straight answers from management in quarterly reporting. The company manufactures, installs and services wind turbines. It has a global presence of 157 GW wind turbines installed and 149 GW of service contracts averaging 11 years duration in 88 countries. It has a substantial footprint in the US & Canada with 42 GW turbines installed and 59 GW under service contracts. Vestas pipeline of development projects amounts to 31 GW, with Australia, US and Brazil having the largest project pipelines. By region, there are 17 GW in APAC, 8 GW in the Americas and 6 GW in EMEA. Vestas Q1 2024 The Q1 2024 Q&A was a very tedious one for management, with questioners trying to find significance in small changes in outcome of Q1. The point that management made constantly is that Vestas has a back ended year and a small decrease in Q1 is not significant. Overall guidance for 2024 was maintained. Vestas has a very level-headed, straightforward Scandinavian management team that comes over strongly in answers to questions. Most of the issues raised were seen as less of a problem than in the recent past (cost pressures, freight, commodities, issues with historical low margin orders). Interspersed with the above tedium, there were a number of insights into various issues that point to good times coming. Opportunities in Australia were emphasised as being new and interesting but timing not clear yet, with Europe and the US being core markets that provide stability. The shortage of power in Europe provides opportunity, although some countries are vacillating. Offshore opportunities with Germany were highlighted. The US is seen as only recently getting fully engaged, but that engagement is interesting. There follow some issues that were discussed that I think are of interest to Vestas investors. Vestas and the US election Management response to a question about potential risks for the upcoming Presidential election was measured and confident. Vestas has done business in the US for decades and it knows about uncertainties of the electoral cycle. Apparently, most customers are confident about building out green electrons. Donald Trump was not mentioned. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm cautious because Donald Trump is very clear that his goal would be to mess up renewables, especially wind power. Perhaps Vestas thinks that a President√¢¬Ä¬ôs power to change things is less straightforward than Donald Trump hopes? Vestas and China Vestas makes claims about being the leading wind turbine provider. In 2023 Vestas claimed 29% of new global onshore & offshore wind installations of 40 GW (excluding China), with other players being SGRE (OTCPK:SMEGF) (24%), GE (GE) (18%), Nordex Group (OTCPK:NRDXF) (16%), Enercon (6%) and others (7%). For comparison, China installed more than 58 GW of wind power in 2023. In terms of global wind turbine production capacity (163GW), China accounts for ~60%. Note that in the Q1 2024 Q&A, management made clear that China is not a market that is open to Vestas. When asked about Chinese competitors, CEO Henrik Andersen indicated that Vestas pays attention to Chinese wind deals mentioning those in the Middle East/LATAM/Africa, but he made no further comment about competition with Chinese wind producers. Just as there are issues about Chinese dominance of the global solar industry, there are issues in Europe and the US about competition from Chinese wind turbine manufacturers. Reports indicate that Chinese orders for wind turbines in 2022 amounted to 55.3 GW from three top Chinese manufacturers (Goldwind Science And Technology (OTCPK:XJNGF), Envision and Mingyang). The competition from China comes not only from manufacturing scale but also innovation. In the past 4 years, 426 new Chinese turbine models have been released, compared with 29 new turbine models outside of China. In 2023, China installed the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs biggest turbine (18 MW) off the coast of the Southern province of Fujian. The world√¢¬Ä¬ôs biggest Mingyang turbine has recently been selected for the Waterkant offshore wind project in the German North Sea, with 16 of the 18.5 MW turbines (260 meter rotor) scheduled for installation in 2028. Australian wind Given the delays that arose in the US in the recent past, Vestas is cautious about major opportunities emerging in Australia, despite the latest news being very encouraging for Vestas. Since 2022, the Australian Government has been working on building an environment to help capture Australia√¢¬Ä¬ôs numerous high quality offshore wind opportunities. The Government has used the following attributes in deciding potential offshore wind locations. The attributes are: i) strong and consistent winds ii) close to areas of high electricity demand iii) existing electricity infrastructure nearby iv) existing transport and port infrastructure Overall, Australia has the potential to generate 5,000 GW of electricity via offshore wind (100x installed capacity of Australia√¢¬Ä¬ôs two largest electricity networks). Six areas have been designated : i) Gippsland, Victoria ii) Hunter, NSW iii) Southern Ocean, Victoria iv) Illawarra, NSW v) Bass Strait, Tasmania vi) Indian Ocean off Bunbury, WA An aside for Australian readers is that the above regions overlap with the opposition party√¢¬Ä¬ôs attempt to dream about a nuclear industry for Australia and use the grid connections of about-to-retire coal plants. The reality behind this nuclear bid is really to delay exit from coal and expand gas; these are developments which, if they ever got to happen, would wreck the offshore wind projects. This gives a hint to the complexity of decarbonising a very fossil fuel intensive industry. I think nuclear and expanded gas have no chance of succeeding, but in today√¢¬Ä¬ôs world, who knows? As the offshore wind opportunities continue to progress, with Vestas well positioned to play a major role, recently Vestas announced completion of its largest ever onshore wind project order from Australian TagEnergy to provide 574 MW capacity (93, V162-6.2MW Vestas turbines) for the second stage of the 1.3GW Golden Plains Wind Farm. The first stage of Australia√¢¬Ä¬ôs largest wind farm, which is located on 16,739 Ha of agricultural land in Western Victoria, commenced in 2023 and involves 756 MW installed capacity (122, V162-6.2 MW Vestas turbines). I give details about the emerging Australian offshore wind opportunity to show how detailed, complex and long-term offshore wind projects are. The APAC (Asia-Pacific) region is becoming a major axis for offshore wind, complementing Europe and the emerging US offshore wind market. Recent information from the Global Wind Energy Council about the APAC offshore wind market suggests that there will be new offshore wind power of 215 GW in the period 2024-2033. China accounts for most (74%) of the expected new offshore wind power and this is not available to Vestas, but there are other emerging markets. These include Taiwan (7%), South Korea (5%), Japan (3%), Vietnam (3%) and India (3%). The Australian opportunity is expected to be 2% of the APAC total. There is a lot of business for Vestas to capture. Data centers and AI Management made clear that any impact of AI and data center power needs is a longer-term issue that isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt going to impact quarterly outcomes. Perhaps the most interesting comment was to point out that there is a change happening concerning who enters PPAs, with the private sector becoming more involved, and that this is likely to be the case with data centers. Conclusion There are a lot of short-term issues impacting Vestas, the latest being a 16.6% fall in share price over the past month, which is likely due at least in part to the rise of right wing politics in Europe and maybe nervousness about a possible Trump Presidency. The point is that Vestas is a strong business with huge global reach (except China, Russia) in 88 countries, and approximately half of its business involves long term service contracts. There is much to get on top of, but my core takeaway is that Vestas occupies a key position in the wind industry that has to grow dramatically this decade if humankind is to have any chance of addressing the looming climate crises. It has calm management at the wheel and a Scandinavian approach to getting things done. Of course, there is a lot of risk but that goes with just about everything in today√¢¬Ä¬ôs world. I am not a financial advisor but I follow the massive transitions happening as the world begins to get serious about exit from fossil fuels and the electrification of everything. I hope that my comments are of interest to you and your financial advisor as you consider how to approach the end of burning fossil fuels.

lFAz7I38O7FLDFK,Seeking Alpha,google,Rivian: Don't Bet On The Wrong EV Challenger (NASDAQ:RIVN),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702578-rivian-dont-bet-on-the-wrong-ev-challenger,2024-07-05 10:27,2024-07-05 10:34,RIVN,,"hapabapa Rivian: Deliveries Performance Closely Watched Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) investors have staged a remarkable revival since its bottom in April 2024. The recent Volkswagen-Rivian joint venture announcement spurred a further recovery in June, helping RIVN stock reach levels last seen in February 2024. RIVN maintained its production guidance and surpassed its Q2 delivery estimates, which has helped maintain the recent bullishness. Therefore, the momentum seems to have returned to RIVN at a pivotal moment as the EV maker attempts to reignite its growth prospects. I last cautioned RIVN investors in an article in early May 2024. I wasn't bearish on the stock then, as I anticipated a potential mean-reversion opportunity. RIVN's relatively high short-interest ratio was also susceptible to rapid short-covering. However, I also urged investors to consider taking advantage of surges to cut exposure, as Rivian is not a fundamentally strong EV company. While Rivian has maintained its annualized production guidance of 57K vehicles for 2024, it aligns with last year's results. Consequently, the company must justify its ability to scale faster while betting that the EV demand dynamics could improve with more conviction. EV leader Tesla, Inc.'s (TSLA) recent delivery performance has given EV investors renewed vigor. While Tesla's Q2 deliveries surpassed downbeat estimates, investors still need to potentially navigate a more competitive EV market environment amid a slowing economy. Coupled with the challenges of a potentially higher-for-longer Fed, interest rate headwinds are still expected to be significant challenges for fledgling EV makers like Rivian. Rivian: Volkswagen Deal Is Pivotal Rivian-Volkswagen partnership (Rivian filings) Volkswagen AG's (OTCPK:VWAGY) (OTCPK:VLKAF) JV with Rivian is significant. Europe's leading automaker has a total commitment of $5B to Rivian through 2026. The deal is also structured to reduce equity dilution risks to Rivian shareholders. CFO Claire McDonough articulated her confidence that Rivian ""prioritizes achieving milestones to potentially minimize dilution impact through increased stock valuation."" Therefore, Rivian is betting that it can execute well and convince the market of the technological superiority of its tech stack to benefit the JV. Achieving the required financial and technological milestones should bolster the market's confidence in re-rating RIVN's valuation. Consequently, it should mitigate the equity dilution risks from Volkswagen's anticipated $2B equity investments from 2025-26. Furthermore, the commitment of $2B by the end of 2024 is significant, lending credence to Volkswagen's recognition of Rivian's technological leadership. As a reminder, the Volkswagen-Rivian JV is limited in scope and primarily focused on network architecture and software. In addition, the JV is expected to be loss-making in the near term. However, there are opportunities to license the technology to other automakers in the future, potentially benefiting Volkswagen and Rivian. RIVN: Improved Momentum Doesn't Change Weak Fundamentals RIVN Quant Grades (Seeking Alpha ) Notwithstanding the recent market euphoria on RIVN, it's critical to note that Rivian is still unprofitable (""F"" profitability grade). Rivian is not expected to turn free cash flow profitable through the FY2027 forecast period. Therefore, a weaker-than-expected ramp could extend the FCF breakeven prospects, necessitating more funding. However, I assess that the market has likely reflected the improved confidence of Rivian getting the endorsement from a leading automaker of its tech stack. Volkswagen's struggles with software are well-documented. Therefore, partnering with Rivian also recognizes that pure-play EV makers like Rivian with a ""clean sheet"" approach have inherent advantages. Furthermore, the need for Volkswagen to pivot competitively in the long-term EV transition should support Rivian. Whether Rivian can count on Volkswagen to provide even more funding, if needed, remains to be seen. The additional funds as part of the JV are already predicated on achieving certain technological and financial milestones. Therefore, investors shouldn't expect ""free money"" to rain down on Rivian, suggesting execution must remain the utmost priority for the EV maker. Is RIVN Stock A Buy, Sell, Or Hold? RIVN price chart (monthly, long-term) (TradingView) RIVN's price action suggests the mean-reversion opportunity that I discussed in my previous article has panned out. Therefore, investors who have waited for an opportunity to cut exposure should capitalize on the surge to get out. Note that the recent surge has not altered RIVN's long-term downtrend bias. RIVN could face more intense selling pressure below the $18 level before potentially resuming its downward trend. Given its weak fundamentals, RIVN's reversal from its oversold position in April shouldn't be misconstrued as a buying opportunity. While the Volkswagen deal has lifted investor sentiment, much still depends on Rivian's execution to obtain the necessary funding. Moreover, the headwinds attributed to the macro environment are arguably out of Rivian's control. Therefore, it may still face significant hurdles in its ambitions to ramp production and improve demand dynamics. Rating: Maintain Hold.

th9lU4fzyUdjppC,Seeking Alpha,bing,Best Buy: A Value Trap,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702570-best-buy-a-value-trap-bby-stock,2024-07-05 10:34,2024-07-05 10:37,MSFT,,"wdstock A cursory glance at Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), the gigantic electronics retailer, may tell the casual investor that this is a great, classic value investment. Best Buy is a stock that's currently trading at below-market valuation multiples, pays a near-5% dividend, and may stand to benefit from a device refresh cycle following landmark AI announcements from many tech brands: what's not to like? In my view, however, confidence in Best Buy is misplaced. The stock is up ~7% year to date and currently offers a 4.6% dividend yield, but I think ongoing risks are likely to put downward pressure on this stock throughout the remainder of the year. Data by YCharts I last wrote a bearish opinion on Best Buy in January, when the stock was trading closer to $75 per share. Best Buy has indeed risen slightly since then but underperformed the broader market. I continue to assign a sell rating to this stock, as I believe two near-term factors are likely to erode investors' confidence in this name:   Decline in same-store sales growth. It's important to note that Best Buy is guiding toward sequential improvement in same-store sales, but we haven't seen any evidence of this being possible just yet. In fact, Q1's same-store sales growth landed on the lower end of the company's initial guidance.  Cash flow is slim, and the company's shareholder returns program is eclipsing what the company is bringing in from an FCF basis.  Meanwhile, here are the longer-term risks I see in Best Buy:   More and more business is shifting online: As more customers prefer e-commerce over in-store shopping, I believe more consumer demand will shift directly toward electronics brands and away from third-party resellers.  Best Buy will have to compete on price: More to the point above, if Best Buy wants to compete against brands directly, it will have to do so on price. The company has noted that consumers have become more and more deal-driven. Competing on price will come at a cost to Best Buy's margin, which is already shrinking.  Replacement cycles are lengthening: The company has also noted that customers, in part pressured by a weaker macro, are hanging onto devices for longer, which is hurting revenue.  All in all, despite Best Buy's dividend and currently cheap 13.5x P/E ratio (based on Wall Street's consensus of $6.10 in pro forma EPS this year), I'm still keen to avoid this name. Weak comparable sales: Is it wise to bank on a turnaround? The first thing investors need to keep in mind: comparable sales (also known as same-store sales), which is a measure of revenue growth while excluding the impact of store openings and closures within the period, continue to decline in the high-single-digit. And yet, the company's outlook for FY25 (the fiscal year for Best Buy ending in January 2025), and thus consensus hopes for Best Buy, rest on comparable sales improving. Best Buy FY25 outlook (Best Buy Q1 earnings release) The company's outlook for FY25 is shown above, and to get to pro forma EPS of $5.75-$6.20 (note that consensus of $6.10 is currently sitting on the higher end of this range), the company is relying on getting same-store sales back to a decline of -3% to flat y/y. And yet in the most recent quarter, Best Buy's overall comparable sales declined -6.1%. The international segment did a little better with a -3.3% decline (and yet note that international is still less than 10% of overall company revenue), while the domestic segment's comparable sales declined -6.3% y/y. Best Buy comparable sales by category (Best Buy Q1 earnings release) There is not a single bright spot among Best Buy's major categories. It is seeing higher comparable sales in services (i.e., support services like Geek Squad) but this is only a very small percentage of total sales. Meanwhile, the appliances and entertainment categories are seeing massive y/y declines. The company is banking on both a more benign consumer spending environment plus demand pull-forward from AI product launches to help recover comparable sales back to growth. Per CEO Corie Barry's remarks on the Q1 earnings call:  From a major category standpoint, we continue to expect sales in our computing category to show growth for the full year. We expect revenue for the rest of our product categories as a whole to be down, partially offset by growth of our services revenue. As we plan for the next three quarters, we expect our comparable sales performance to sequentially improve. For the second quarter specifically, we expect comparable sales to decline approximately 3% compared to the 6% decline we saw in Q1. Based on month-to-date sales and results, our estimated comparable sales for May are expected to be better than our Q2 guidance. We are encouraged by these results, but from a timing perspective, we don't fully lap last year's Memorial Day sales until our June fiscal week one, and we continue to be very thoughtful about the time periods between sales events. Let's talk about computing and the exciting things happening there. We expect the category to benefit as early replacement and upgrade cycles gain momentum, and new products featuring even more AI capabilities are released as we move through the year. We have seen early signs of improvement as year-over-year comparable sales for laptops turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter and that trend continued in Q1. Last week, Microsoft announced Copilot Plus and laptops from Microsoft, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung are available for pre-order on our website right now and will be available on June 18. These devices have faster speed, better battery life, greater efficiency, they are much cooler, and baseline Copilot features like summarization that can quickly recap pages of documents or lengthy email threads.""  Needless to say, it's not a safe bet to bank on growth acceleration that hasn't happened yet. We don't have concrete results to demonstrate that Microsoft's Copilot Plus announcements, or Apple's Apple Intelligence announcement at WWDC, will stimulate any compression in the refresh cycle for Best Buy and other retailers. Dividend risks Meanwhile: Best Buy is spending cash on dividends and share buybacks like a company that's generating a lot more income than it actually is. Take a look at the Q1 cash flow statement below: Best Buy FCF (Best Buy Q1 earnings release) Operating cash flow in Q1 was only $156 million, and after netting off $152 million spent on capex, FCF was close to zero. At the same time, Best Buy spent $252 million on dividends ($202 million, $0.94 per share per quarter) and buybacks ($50 million). This isn't just a seasonality of cash flow issue either, as we know Q1 tends to be a slower sales quarter for Best Buy. The same issue persisted throughout the entirety of FY23 as well. In FY23, as shown below, Best Buy generated $1.47 billion in operating cash flow but only $675 million in FCF after capex: Best Buy FY23 FCF (Best Buy Q4 earnings release) Meanwhile, the company spent $801 million on dividends, and $340 million on buybacks, for $1.14 billion in total capital returns. Key takeaways  In other words: Don't make the mistake of thinking that Best Buy's dividend is anywhere close to safe. The company is currently in a roughly cash-neutral position ($1.21 billion of cash and $1.15 billion of debt, or $60 million in net cash), so it could increase its leverage to keep funding its dividend hole.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has soared in the last few days following the announcement that it had exceeded its delivery expectations. However, these had previously been lowered further and further. Especially in a year-on-year comparison, and if we look at the general sales, profit, and margin development, we cannot speak of positive developments for the company. The forward P/E ratio is now very high, even for Tesla standards. Tesla's share price fluctuates strongly; there will be better entry points again. What happened yesterday? In the last five days, the share has gained 22% and is now back above its 52-week average, thus back in an upward trend. What happened? Seeking Alpha There are reports that Tesla exceeded delivery estimates in the second quarter, i.e., delivered more than expected and sold more than BYD Company Limited (OTCPK:BYDDF) overall in the first six months of 2024.  Tesla is being sized up by analysts and investors are reporting 443,956 deliveries for Q2 to beat the consensus estimate for a tally of 439,302 vehicles. Notably, most of Tesla's sales came from the smaller and cheaper Models 3 and Y lines, with the company selling only 21,551 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck. For the first half of the year, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) sold more than 910,000 vehicles globally, which was higher than the tally for Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD Company. Seeking Alpha news.  It sounds great at first, but there's a catch. According to Bloomberg's graphic, the estimates have been repeatedly revised downwards, so reality has now caught up with and overtaken these increasingly poor estimates. Bloomberg The quote below summarizes the situation well. Further down in this article, I include a chart showing the company's long-term sales development, where this can also be seen.  Moreover, even beating estimates meant a 5% drop in deliveries, year over year. On a rolling four-quarter basis, Tesla's vehicle sales flattened out last summer and Musk in January explicitly abandoned the company's previous growth target of 50% per year, compounded. The beaten-down consensus estimate implies sales dropping outright in 2024. With the first-half numbers now in the books, even hitting that forecast requires two record quarters in a row, averaging 487,000 deliveries apiece. Pending that next ""growth wave,"" Tesla's core business, accounting for 89% of its gross profit, isn't growing. Bloomberg: Only Musk's Robotaxi Can Save Tesla Investors Now.  Overall, it appears that CEO Elon Musk has successfully managed to draw the market's attention to the next big things: AI, robotaxis, and robots. This distracts from the actual current business development, which is doing less well. An interesting tweet from Elon: The 22% rise in just five days may also be partly the result of a short squeeze. X Elon Musk Industry Overview Recently, I wrote an in-depth, nearly 5,000-word article titled ""Power Shift Part 2: Western Brands In China's EV Market,"" which will be my go-to article over the next few months regarding the industry overview of the EV market. The article is particularly relevant for Tesla investors, as Tesla produces and sells a significant proportion of its vehicles in China. I also go into more detail about the markets, somewhat pejoratively referred to as the ""Rest of the World,"" and the impact of the recently introduced 100% tariffs. The Past: Financial Progress & Trends This is an overview of revenues, expenses, and net income over a longer period, which shows the company's main problem: the growth dynamic is no longer there. This is the first thing to consider-apart from any plans, it is important to step back and see where we currently stand. In Tesla's main business, which consists primarily of cars, growth has become stagnant. Data by YCharts This upper graph also demonstrates the convergence of the revenue and expense lines, which means that the margins are decreasing. In the following comparison of the EBIT margin, we see that Tesla is no longer doing so well compared to some of its competitors. Data by YCharts However, I would like to point out that the EBIT margin does not include interest payments. The net income margin of highly indebted companies may look significantly worse. If we look at the figures and compare the same companies, we see that all of them, except Tesla, have worse numbers. How can that be? Tesla earns income through interest, while highly indebted companies have to make interest payments. Additionally, Tesla benefits from favorable tax advantages. Data by YCharts In my view, it makes sense for Tesla to lower its margins to put the EV competition under as much pressure as possible. Currently, for example, Ford is losing a lot of money with its electric division. If Tesla puts them under continued pricing pressure, Ford is faced with the choice of either staying exclusively with combustion cars or continuing to lose money with electric vehicles. I analyzed Ford just a few days ago. Currently, the car market is under enormous competition, as there are old classic brands and new pure electric vehicle brands. I assume that many companies will not survive the competition and will exit the market by the end of the decade. Tesla can accelerate this process through price pressure on the competition. The present: Valuation The company's enterprise value is $769B, its market cap is $786B, and its cash position is about $16B. Tesla's valuations often seem irrational, but we all know the market reflects the future. I think Tesla is best compared with itself, and of course, you should always take the business development into account. We can see that in the last two years, the future P/E ratio has rarely been as high as it is now. Data by YCharts It's a bad sign if the forward P/E ratio is higher than the current one. The situation turned in 2023, and now the gap to the current P/E ratio is widening. Another bad sign is that this is happening while the core business is stagnating or even declining. Another useful figure is Enterprise Value to EBIT, as EBIT is less distorted by interest payments from the cash position or tax effects. Here, too, the recent increase has brought us back to a very high level. Data by YCharts Of course, the areas of autonomous driving, robots, AI, and other things have enormous potential, but it is by no means certain that Tesla will prevail against the competition here. Not only will Tesla produce robots, but several other companies will as well, and mass production and adoption within the population are not yet here. In my view, a forward P/E ratio of 96 is far too high in a situation where the core business is stagnating, margins are falling, competition from China is intense, and the Cybertruck has been massively criticized in reviews. Short-term trades are another topic; I'm not talking about that. But there will likely be better entry points for a long-term investment. In the charts above, we can see that there were repeated entry points where the future P/E ratio was below 40. Risks The market is pricing in many possible positive future developments, but are you also pricing in the risks? I have doubts about that, and Tesla faces several risks. The ""Power Shift Part 2"" article I mentioned at the beginning is about the sharp rise in competition from China. On the one hand, in the Chinese market, which is highly competitive and where Tesla generated around 22% of its sales in 2023. On the other hand, there is also international competition, as Chinese companies are penetrating more markets and now exporting worldwide. I spend a lot of time in Southeast Asia, especially Thailand and Vietnam, and I see more BYD vehicles than Teslas there. The global markets are becoming increasingly important, while the West is declining in relevance. Below, we see EV sales by region. In 2022, the rest of the world was as big a market as the US, but much bigger in 2023. Europe is another important market for Tesla, and there, too, Chinese companies are rapidly gaining market share. Power Shift Part 2: Western Brands In China's EV Market The recently introduced high tariffs in the USA on Chinese vehicles could also threaten Tesla. This may protect sales on the domestic market, but it could also result in retaliatory measures by the Chinese government. For example, soft power measures such as influencing social media could be used to tempt the Chinese population to buy Chinese vehicles rather than Western brands. I think something similar is happening in the Smartphone sector, where Chinese national pride could play a role in purchasing Huawei devices over Apple ones, as the company has now managed to overcome the tough sanctions. Share dilution, insider trades & SBC These three things are standard checks I make in every article, as excessive stock dilution and stock-based compensation (""SBC"") can disadvantage shareholders. In addition, insider trades sometimes contain valuable information about management's confidence. Data by YCharts Net profit was $13.6B in the last twelve months. While $1.91 billion is a lot for SBC, I have seen higher figures for many companies, especially in the tech sector. As far as the increase in outstanding shares is concerned, it has slowed considerably and now hardly affects existing shareholders. These are all insider trades from the last six months, which is also much less than in previous years. OpenInsider Conclusion Considering the current actual business development, falling margins, and strong Chinese competition, it is fair to say that the high valuation is based almost exclusively on future hopes, such as robotics. I think the valuation is currently far too high for a buy; on the contrary, I think it's more of a profit-taking opportunity. We have seen recently that the valuation of Tesla does not always remain this high but fluctuates strongly, I am confident that there will be better entry points again. Here is a quick checklist to summarize some of the most essential aspects.        Investor's Checklist Check Description   Rising revenues? No Increasing over longer periods   Improving margins? No Possible competitive edge   PEG ratio below one? No PEG ratio below one may suggest undervaluation   Sufficient cash reserves? Yes Vital for the survival & growth, especially of unprofitable companies   Rewards shareholders? No Returning capital to shareholders   Shareholder negatives?

The year-to-date laggard of the Magnificent Seven has now vaulted into positive territory after many quarters of meandering while investors grapple with Tesla's identity as either a car company or as an artificial intelligence (AI) play. I believe Tesla (TSLA) remains one of the purest AI plays available to investors and has even more room to go higher as shorts cover their positions and investor enthusiasm reignites. Various headwinds have applied downside pressure to the stock in 2024: intense competition in China, weakening EV adoption globally, layers of price cuts, various layoffs, and continued media scrutiny of Elon Musk. The recent surge in TSLA's stock price has changed sentiment as Tesla seemingly has regained its mojo. Another key milestone event lays ahead at the August robotaxi event. TSLA YTD mountain Tesla, YTD Although year-over-year growth was negative, in Q2 Tesla delivered nearly 444k vehicles, representing a 14.8% increase versus the first quarter. The stock has not looked back since, with the hope that global EV demand may be resurfacing. The trade I have recently presented several bullish options trades on Tesla and with momentum building, I want to persist with that bullish theme. However, I do have concerns that the robotaxi event could disappoint and I suggest traders to manage any and all Tesla risk prior to that event. Since I believe Tesla will continue to explore its new higher range for the year, I want to own another upside call spread. Buying this call spread is not cheap but by selling that upside call, I defer some of the cost of owning the lower strike price. Also, I chose an end of July expiration date for this spread which is about a week before the much anticipated robotaxi event. Bought the $245 Call 7/26/2024 expiry for $16.50 Sold the $265 Call 7/26/2024 expiry for $$9.75 This bullish call spread cost $6.75 or $675 per one spread I established this trade when TSLA was roughly trading $244 Tesla has been historically volatile around key milestones, this call spread may fluctuate as prices may be volatile in the month of July.

""We downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet,"" said New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu in a report on Friday.  The firm values Nvidia at 35x, and set a 12-month price target of $135 on the AI GPU leader.   ""The quality of the franchise is nevertheless intact, and we would be buyers again, but only on prolonged weakness,"" Ferragu added. Wall Street maintains a bullish take on Nvidia. Out of the 54 Wall Street analysts' ratings made in the last 90 days on Seeking Alpha, 41 analysts rate it a Strong Buy, nine a Buy and only four Holds. However, Seeking Alpha analysts and Seeking Alpha's Quant system, which regularly beats the market, both rate it at Hold. New Street maintains its Buy ratings on several other stocks exposed to AI infrastructure trends, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron Technology (MU).  ""For the first time since we called an inflection in spending for AI infrastructure in January 2023, we see expectations for AI semis aligned with capacity planning in the supply chain, aligned with the expansion of demand beyond hyperscalers, implying very strong capex revisions towards high-teens capex-to-sales ratios, and aligned with giga-cluster deployment plans,"" Ferragu said.

The embedded finance market is experiencing a massive disruption because of the development of technologies such as API, AI, blockchain, etc. This capability allows companies to incorporate financial services into their platforms, delivering consistent and unique solutions. Furthermore, demand for new complex, value-added, readily available services that can be offered in real-time has pressured firms in almost all industries to embrace embedded finance. This shift helps non-financial firms to provide banking, lending, insurance, and payment services, which fortifies customer relations and generates more revenues. This market is divided into segments based on different aspects, such as the type, business model, and industry. Type includes solutions such as embedded payments, embedded lending, embedded insurance, embedded investment/wealth management, and others such as issuance and deposits. The business model includes both B2B and B2C. The industry segment focuses on retail & eCommerce, healthcare, education, telecom, transportation, mobility and logistics, travel & hospitality, and other industries, namely real estate, energy, media & entertainment, and agriculture. These segments collectively offer a comprehensive overview of the evolving embedded finance landscape and its potential business implications.Story continuesRequest Sample Pages@ https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=126584658Based on industry, retail & eCommerce sector to hold the largest market size during the forecast period.The research identified several drivers that would make the retail and e-commerce sector the most significant market for embedded finance throughout the forecast period, including the steady growth in online purchasing coupled with the rising number of digital consumers requires effective financial services integrated into the e-commerce platforms; BNPL products increase consumers' purchasing capacity, leading to increased spending. Personalization capabilities enable retailers to offer customized financial products to their customers, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty. Secure payment gateways and other algorithms in fintech underline smooth transaction processes, leading to higher consumer confidence. An omnichannel approach that integrates both online and offline experiences has financial services that help improve the shopping experience. Growing cooperation between fintech and retailers helps to achieve significant integration and compliance with the requirements to introduce new services. At the same time, the growth of mobile commerce enhances the demand for integrated mobile payments. Collectively, these factors explain the large market size of the retail and e-commerce segment in the embedded finance market during the forecast period.Based on the business model, the B2C model is expected to hold a higher growth rate during the forecast period.The B2C model for embedded finance is expected to experience tremendous growth primarily because of the rising customer expectations for integrated and omnichannel financial solutions. The development of digital channels and e-commerce fuels the need for broader implementation. Innovation experiences in fintech, APIs, and AI, for instance, have helped ease integration, lowering entry barriers. Moreover, the strategic B2C model increases customer loyalty and customer retention since it provides them with individualized financial services, thus building lasting partnerships. It also widens the market since consumers who used to be locked out from accessing financial facilities due to various factors can access business ventures. Favorable economic and demographic indicators, such as improved disposable income, especially in emerging markets, as well as enhanced access to the Internet, have also boosted the demand for integrated financial services. These factors have made it evident that the B2C embedded finance model will likely realize faster growth during the forecast period under consideration.Inquire Before Buying@¬†https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=126584658Asia Pacific is expected to hold a higher growth rate during the forecast period.The Asia Pacific region will have the highest growth rate in the Embedded Finance Market for the next forecast period because of several factors. The constantly expanding digitally linked economy due to the rise in Internet connection and smartphone use makes it easier to incorporate financial services into consumer apps. The growth of e-commerce and a continuously increasing volume of online purchases, the development of the middle class and a gradual increase in the available amount of money encourage the desire to have non-cash payment solutions such as digital wallets and BNPL. State programs aimed at developing digital financial services make a helping condition, and significant investments in fintech start-ups and technological development fuel the market's growth. A large population of the countries in this region presents a substantial demand for financial services. The tech firms collaborate with different institutions and businesses to ensure that financial services are integrated into a universal platform. All these factors combined make it possible to affirm that the Asia Pacific region will maintain a favorable, capturing growth rate in the forecast period.Top Companies in Embedded Finance Market:The major vendors covered in the Embedded Finance Market are Stripe, Inc.

The impact has also been felt at Coinbase, which reported it had $935 million in revenue from customer crypto trading in the first quarter, double what it was in the fourth quarter. MicroStrategy said in its first-quarter financial report that it owned 214,400 bitcoin. Coinbase shares were down about 5% to $213.87 as of 10:45 a.m. ET Friday, while MicroStrategy fell more than 6% to $1,220.11. Still, shares of Coinbase and MicroStrategy have surged about 23% and 93% year-to-date.Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

Firstly, it was ""to be"" as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) charged from the breakout area towards $300, and then it was ""not to be"" as the share price of the electric vehicle (""EV"") giant slowly retraced backwards to $140 but staying within the confines of the initial three wave patterns of $101-$217. Anyway, more on that later. On Monday, Tesla was the only equity in my buy call portfolio that can be found exclusively with Seeking Alpha that was negative. Those that follow my weekly video update (On the docket) on LinkedIn, will know that in this week's edition, I called that Tesla's break above the $200 region would see this stock looking for $260 next, what I didn't realize was the ferocity in which it would go looking for that region. One of the things I noted was that the structure of the three wave pattern on the monthly chart ""could"" be interpreted as extremely bullish, subsequently as the week has rolled on this has been the case. In this article, we will cover the catalyst that has seen this sudden wave of buying while looking at the charts for a deep dive into what is quite a complex structure, as Tesla returns to positive by bypassing $217 again on my 2023 buy call. We will try to identify where this equity may be headed next. Tesla stormed the market this week with a Q2 surprise of 411k EV's produced and 444k delivered. This figure is a dip in year-on-year deliveries. However, concerns in this sector of late have been alleviated with the world's largest EV manufacturer producing solid numbers. With the robotaxi event scheduled for August the 8th coming, Wall Street sees somewhat of a rejuvenation of Tesla, and it's showing in their share price. Next up are the Q2 financial results on July 23rd and the market will be watching with a keen eye, anticipating further solid numbers. Rival manufacturers NIO Inc. (NIO) and Geely (OTCPK:GELYF) also reported strong deliveries for last month, which is cementing the sentiment that this market is still on an upward trajectory. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas has an overweight rating for Tesla with a $310 price target, while Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has raised his target to $300, with $400 a possibility for 2025. Now, let's examine the charts to gauge technically where this equity may be looking to go. Briefly, before we move onto the 2023 call, those who have followed me since I started publishing my analysis with Seeking Alpha in 2022, will know that one of my first articles was for Tesla to break from $708 to $176, with an additional target of $121. Subsequently, Tesla bottomed at $101 and found a wave of buying to $217 where it found rejection and thus created a path to $334 by breaking above that rejection, a wave this equity is still in. This pattern can be seen on the monthly chart below, reaching $300 before retracing essentially sideways for a number of months before breaking down to $140. Tesla monthly chart (C trader) Let's now move over to the current side of the pattern and given the complexity of the original wave, Tesla remains in to $334, now there are additional targets possibly in the $400 area, so this is where things get a little technical. The new three wave pattern in short qualifies as wave one $140-$200, wave two $200-$165 with the third wave breakout looking for completion at $260 in this immediate move. Tesla monthly chart (C trader) If Tesla is to keep climbing it will have to find rejection again at some stage on the monthly chart, this is how financial markets climb over time, they find bullish buying vs. bearish selling that if the said market can break above both, then moves onto repeat that process in its new price zone. The rejection in this case could come at $260, but it is interesting to note that there is confluence at what is the original Fibonacci 161 level from the 2023 breakout of $294 with the current additional Fibonacci level from upward from $260 in this move being at $287. So there will lie the next stop after $260 if that is to be achieved. Then we can see the $334 region next which is completion from the original 2023 move with additional confluence circa the $400 region which then in turn is the Fibonacci 261 also from the 2023 move and the Fibonacci 423 from this current breakout. Bearish Scenario Tesla still has a lot of work to do to get to the $400 region, but with the pace, it is currently racing upwards as there are obviously no bearish patterns. In theory, it isn't far away from that region, given how quickly this equity can move. Figures on the 23rd of this month that the market doesn't like can put a halt to this buy up. As the year progresses, additional data that is a miss can also pause this move. To finalize: I am issuing an additional buy signal with a new target of $400 for Tesla. Combined with Elon Musk being allocated his $56 billion pay deal which has appeared to be a positive move, strong figures in this sector in general, and the upcoming robotaxi progress as an addition to the company, I believe Tesla can reach $400 within the next twelve months.

KLP3h03iBXUEORc,Seeking Alpha,google,Volkswagen Blockbuster Deal Makes Rivian A Buy (Upgrade) (NASDAQ:RIVN),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702583-vw-blockbuster-deal-makes-rivian-a-buy-upgrade,2024-07-05 11:06,2024-07-05 11:14,RIVN,,"hapabapa A week ago, Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) shocked investors positively by announcing that it was partnering with automaker Volkswagen AG (OTCPK:VLKAF) and that the German auto giant would invest billions of dollars into a joint venture with the American electric vehicle company. The new alliance is obviously directed at countering Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and aims to lower development costs for both companies. Though Rivian Automotive still has considerable sales (and estimated correction risks) in a market that is seeing a slowdown in EV shipments, I think that the deal is sensible and makes strategic sense for both companies. My Rating History My last article on Rivian Automotive entitled Rivian: 80% Of Market Value Is Now Cash was a √¢¬Ä¬òHold√¢¬Ä¬ô, primarily because the electric vehicle company√¢¬Ä¬ôs market valuation consisted of 80% out of cash. This cash cushion created a substantial margin of safety for investors. I am modifying my stock classification for Rivian Automotive to √¢¬Ä¬òBuy√¢¬Ä¬ô after the electric vehicle company surprised investors with a strategic investment from German automaker Volkswagen at the end of June. With Volkswagen putting billions of dollars into a 50:50 joint venture, I think that the risk/reward relationship is looking much better for Rivian Automotive. Deal Implications Of Volkswagen, Rivian Partnership At the end of June, Volkswagen and Rivian announced that they are going to enter into a partnership that will see the German automaker invest $1.0 billion this year and an additional $4.0 billion by 2026 into a 50:50 joint venture. This joint venture will develop next-gen electrical architecture for EVs as well as software. It should be noted, however, that the agreement does not mean that both companies will jointly develop new electric vehicles. The joint venture will use Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs hardware and technology platform and both companies will develop their own electric vehicle brands moving forward. In short, Rivian Automotive is contributing its EV tech while Volkswagen is financing the joint venture in order to speed up its own electric vehicle development. The agreement is nonetheless significant, particularly for Rivian Automotive, whose pure-play positioning in the electric vehicle market has led to some investor concerns in recent quarters, particularly as they relate to the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs profit trajectory. With sales falling behind earlier expectations as the electric vehicle market shows signs of saturation, investors are worried about Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs sky-high losses. The blockbuster deal with Volkswagen could help trim those losses. The blockbuster deal with Volkswagen could help trim those losses, particularly because the $5.0 billion investment to be made by the German automaker could take pressure off of Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs cash flow. Sharing development costs and expenses is a great way for Rivian Automotive to alleviate its challenges with cash flow, which unfortunately is still very much negative. In the most recent financial quarter, Rivian Automotive had a negative operating cash flow of $1.3 billion and the company has been consistently unprofitable on a free cash flow basis as well, primarily because of growing capital expenditures related to the ramp of its various EVs.   Consolidated Statements Of Cash Flows (Rivian Automotive Inc) The sharing of development costs could be a boon for Rivian Automotive, obviously, because the electric vehicle company needs to urgently address concerns about its lack of profitability. The agreement with Volkswagen should allow Rivian Automotive to do just that and potentially even accelerate its profit timeline. As of right now, Rivian Automotive is still losing a lot of cash on its operations and the electric vehicle company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of almost $800 million in the last quarter. Though EBITDA losses narrowed $222 million YoY, investors today are much less willing to finance ongoing operating losses for electric vehicle companies simply because risk attitudes have changed in a market that needs to absorb steady news of slowing electric vehicle sales growth. If Rivian Automotive gets to reign in its negative EBITDA with the help of Volkswagen, I think the EV company has a great chance to grow into a higher valuation moving forward. Adjusted EBITDA (Rivian Automotive Inc) Rivian Automotive Is A Steal Based On Cash Value Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs consensus sales estimates are falling and have done so for quite a while as the market came to terms with the notion of slowing growth in the market. The consequence has been a steady flow of estimate revisions for Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs sales: Presently, the market models $6.54 billion in sales for the EV company in 2025 which is down about 1% since my last piece on the company was published in May. Revenue Estimate (Yahoo Finance) Electric vehicle companies have suffered a reset in their sales estimates in the last year as demand issues began to be widely reported. Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs attempts to boost electric vehicle shipments, starting last year, through aggressive promotions have further amplified the problem for large EV companies: They are competing for lower-than-anticipated sales in the electric vehicle industry, pushing companies like Fisker over the cliff and into bankruptcy. If consensus estimates for 2025 are correct, Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs stock is valued at 2.04x leading sales, though the electric vehicle company has sold for significantly higher sales multiples in the past. Taking into account the downtrend in sales estimates, an alternative approach to valuing Rivian Automotive might be based on Rivan Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs substantial cash and investment balance. Rivian Automotive presently has a market value of $13.4 billion. As of March 31, 2024, the EV company had $7.86 billion in cash stashed on its balance sheet which includes the value of its short-term investments. Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs total cash balance (including short-term investments and restricted cash) dwindled by $3.9 billion over the last twelve months, meaning the company had a cash burn of about $1.0 billion per quarter. Based on last quarter√¢¬Ä¬ôs balance sheet, this means that 59% of Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs valuation now consists of cash. The scaling up of production is going to cost Rivian Automotive a substantial amount of money moving forward, but with Volkswagen stepping up and helping fund the joint venture, the EV company could see less cash burn in the next two years, which in turn could accelerate Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs profit schedule. Though Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs cash-to-market-value percentage is down from 80% in May, it nonetheless reflects a high margin of safety for investors that are concerned about Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs risks in a softening market, particularly with the EV company now likely sharing development costs and risks with Volkswagen. Rivian Automotive will probably continue to lose money on its EV production moving forward, but the cash-to-market-value percentage is still rather excessive and limits risks for investors, in my view. Rivian Automotive will likely continue to see negative cash flow as it ramps up R2/R3 production, but with Volkswagen throwing $5.0 billion at a joint venture with Rivian Automotive, I anticipate that cash will continue to make up about 50% of the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs balance sheet. With such an excessive cash balance and a more favorable cash flow outlook, I see a substantial margin of safety for Rivian Automotive. Why The Investment Thesis Still Has Considerable Risks Rivian Automotive has sales and sales estimate correction risks in a market that is seeing slowing demand for electric vehicles. The bankruptcy of Fisker is another example of the heightened risks that investors in electric vehicle companies are facing. Though Rivian Automotive is not at risk of bankruptcy given its considerable cash power, I think that we are going to see more bankruptcies in the sector moving forward with only the largest EV companies able to survive. My Conclusion Rivian Automotive has done a blockbuster deal with VW here and I think that the electric vehicle company is set to profit through an accelerated profit timeline and alleviating pressure on its costs. As Volkswagen is primarily financing the joint venture, Rivian Automotive could finally be put into a position that allows it to address its weak point: high EBITDA losses in a low-demand environment. Furthermore, Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs valuation still contains a very big margin of safety as the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs cash accounts for almost 60% of its market valuation. Though sales estimates can be anticipated to remain under pressure in the short term, Rivian Automotive√¢¬Ä¬ôs risk/reward relationship looks much better to me. Buy.

Only four stocks -- Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOG) -- are responsible for over 52% of the S&P 500 (SP500) return through the first half of the year, according to data from FactSet. In addition, only two out of the 11 market sectors -- those are information technology (XLK) and communications services (XLC) -- have outperformed the S&P 500 this year. But market breadth is likely to broaden with more stocks expected to go up between now and the end of the year, said Wells Fargo Strategist Scott Wren in the note.

Earnings fundamentals are supporting the AI-related stock performances. During the first quarter, earnings within communication services (XLC) grew 44% year-over-year, and within technology earnings grew 25% year-over-year.

rYacZb2grJbA2sS,Yahoo Finance,bing,Dueling approaches to AI in autonomous trucking,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dueling-approaches-ai-autonomous-trucking-150000340.html,2024-07-05 11:26,2024-07-05 11:38,UBER,,"Autonomous trucking pioneer Chris Urmson and relative latecomer Raquel Urtasun see AI as critical to making autonomous trucking successful. But they do not see eye to eye on the best way to apply it.Urmson led Google‚Äôs Self Driving Car Project that eventually became Waymo. He co-founded Aurora Innovation in 2017.When Uber sold its Advanced Technologies Group to Aurora in January 2021, Urtasun was Uber ATG chief scientist and head of research and development. She and Urmson know each other‚Äôs work but never worked together directly. Urtasun also has been a professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto for the past decade.Autonomous trucking leader boardAurora is the acknowledged leader in autonomous truck development. It has the financing in place and has checked nearly every box to start commercial operations with 20 driverless trucks as soon as the end of this year.It struggled for a time. Urmson in 2022 looked at the possibility of selling the business to Apple or Microsoft. Aurora acknowledges it will need more funding to scale the business to integrate manufacturing of its Aurora Driver with supplier partner Continental AG in 2027.But as other autonomous players ‚Äì notably Embark, TuSimple and Waymo Via ‚Äì have failed, exited or paused U.S. operations, Aurora has emerged along with Kodiak Robotics as the two companies closest to commercialization. Daimler Truck independent subsidiary Torc Robotics is well along but sees 2027 for its driverless launch date.Another startup, Plus, recently began working with Traton Group‚Äôs Navistar on Level 4 autonomy.A $200 million capital infusion for WaabiWaabi is a latecomer but expects to launch driverless trucks in 2025. It recently raised $200 million in a Series B funding round. Participants included several Aurora partners: chipmaker Nvidia; Khosla Ventures, which led Waabi‚Äôs Series A round in 2021 that raised $83.5 million; and Volvo Group Venture Capital.Volvo Group is one of Aurora‚Äôs two redundant chassis manufacturing partners. Peterbilt and Kenworth parent Paccar Inc. is the other.Uber invests and partners with both on safety driver-monitored autonomous runs on I-45 between Dallas and Houston.What is verifiable AI?In what could be considered dueling blog posts, Urmson and Urtasun laid out their approaches to AI in autonomous trucking. Aurora favors a hybrid approach that it calls verifiable AI. Wabbi is all-in on end-to-end AI, closer to cognitive Level 5 autonomy than machine learning-based Level 4. Both operate without human drivers. But that is where they diverge.Story continuesUrmson explains verifiable AI as addressing the challenges of AI alignment, avoiding hallucinations like adding glue to a pizza. It incorporates the rules of the road ‚Äì stopping at a stop sign, going on green, not driving on the wrong side of the road, etc.An Aurora Innovation autonomous truck operated without a driver at a Pittsburgh test facility in March. (Photo: Alan Adler/FreightWaves)Take a lane change, for example.‚ÄúIt seems simple: Find a big enough gap and maneuver under control into the next lane,‚Äù Urmson wrote in his June 13 blog on Aurora‚Äôs website. ‚ÄùAnd if the adjacent lane is empty, it‚Äôs easy.‚ÄùOf course, if there‚Äôs a vehicle in the next lane, staying put should be obvious. But what if the driver in the adjacent lane is slightly slowing, suggesting an opening to make the move? Do you accelerate and do it?‚ÄúThis is where artificial intelligence can solve problems that a rules-based approach to engineering simply can‚Äôt,‚Äù Urmson wrote. ‚ÄúBut how do we make sure that an AI will be well behaved and not do something alarming or dangerous?‚ÄùAurora sees general purpose AI as incompatible with autonomous trucking. Stopping at red lights is not a suggestion. It is just one encoded hard rule of the road.‚ÄúThose naively attempting to solve self-driving using a pure end-to-end system will find themselves bogged down in a game of whack-a-mole, much like the folks delivering large language models have,‚Äù Urmson said.The case for end-to-end AIUrmson didn‚Äôt call out Waabi by name, but he may as well have. Tesla and London-based Wayve also are pursuing end-to-end AI systems for autonomy.‚ÄúWaabi has pioneered a single end-to-end AI system that is capable of human-like reasoning, enabling it to generalize to any situation that might happen on the road, including those it has never seen before,‚Äù Urtasun wrote in a June 18 blog announcing the capital raise.Leaving behind those who fear AI‚Äôs potential for conquering the world, Urtasun sides with those who see only the good in AI.Raquel Urtasun, CEO of Waabi, says an end-to-end AI system is the right approach for autonomous trucks. (Photo: Waabi)‚ÄúThe next leap forward will see generative AI graduate out of the virtual world and move into the physical world where it will interact with humans in their day-to-day lives,‚Äù she wrote.Making a case that AI alone can form the basis of an autonomous driving system comes from Urtasun‚Äôs two decades of research. Can it operate in a provably safe manner? It already does in Waabi World, which Urtasun calls the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs most advanced generative AI-powered simulator‚Äù that bypasses manual code adjustments.Waabi trucks are moving freight with safety drivers in Texas ahead of driverless operation planned for 2025. (Photo: Waabi)Like Aurora ‚Äì and other autonomous trucking developers ‚Äì Waabi is moving loads with safety drivers in Texas just three years after its founding. Uber Freight signed a 10-year partnership with Waabi in September. The goal: Deploy billions of miles of Waabi Driver capacity alongside carrier partners on the Uber Freight network during the next decade.Which approach is right? Maybe both.Uber Freight, an early freight partner of Aurora, and Volvo Autonomous Solutions are willing to bet on more than one solution.‚ÄúWe feel confident that continued investment in a competitive autonomous driving landscape will not only stimulate additional technological capabilities but enable the evolution and maturity of the autonomous vehicle industry,‚Äù Nils Jaeger, president of Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said in a statement included with Waabi‚Äôs funding announcement.George Gianarikas, a Canaccord Genuity analyst, tends to side with Aurora on the AI issue. He sees Waabi as a possible second source of autonomous systems for Volvo just as Daimler could turn to Aurora as an outside supplier if Waymo stays on the sidelines.‚ÄúWhile we would not be surprised by some market success from [Waabi], we continue to maintain that the North American Class 8 [autonomous] trucking market is Aurora‚Äôs to lose,‚Äù Gianarikas wrote in a June 19 investor note.Briefly noted ‚Ä¶Nikola beat its projected sales numbers for fuel cell trucks in the second quarter, wholesaling 72 units, ahead of its high-end sales guidance of 60 units.Hight Logistics, a Southern California port drayage operator, has signed an order for an additional 19 Volvo VNR Electric trucks, bringing to 24 its fleet of battery-electric VNRs.Separately, Volvo has begun early production of ist new long-haul Class 8 VNL flagship models at a $400 million plant expansion in Dublin, Virginia.Volvo Group‚Äôs $400 million addition to its New River Valley assembly complex in Dublin, Virginia, is up and running.

Midstream energy companies focused on natural gas should be visible long-term beneficiaries from the build out of data-center capacity in the U.S. to run AI operations, WFII said in a July 1 strategy note. About 43% of electricity is generated from natural gas and the build-out of energy-hungry data centers is in very early stages, Ian Mikkelsen, equity sector analyst at WFII, said.  √¢¬Ä¬úWe believe that U.S. natural gas production capacity and reserves are sufficient to meet growing demand, with infrastructure being the key constraint in balancing supply with this demand growth over time,√¢¬Ä¬ù Mikkelsen said. √¢¬Ä¬úWe expect this to provide midstream companies with incremental growth opportunities and higher utilization of existing assets, ultimately extending the terminal value of natural gas infrastructure.√¢¬Ä¬ù While many developers prefer to power new data centers with renewable energy, WFII expects expects the share of natural gas generation in the power mix to remain fairly steady in the intermediate term because of pace limitations on developing renewables.  Meanwhile, the re-shoring of industrial manufacturing facilities and the build out of additional export capacity for liquefied natural gas serve as other supportive pillars. √¢¬Ä¬úWe believe these trends are secular in nature and, in our view, large companies in the Midstream Energy sub-sector that are focused on natural gas and have broad interstate operations are well positioned to benefit,√¢¬Ä¬ù Mikkelsen said, without specifying any companies.

VX5i92r9vxN2sV6,Seeking Alpha,google,Intel: Why The Dip Is Not Fair (NASDAQ:INTC),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702587-intel-why-the-dip-is-not-fair,2024-07-05 11:40,2024-07-05 11:44,INTC,,"JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images My thesis Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is very attractively valued for a stock with such solid exposure to AI and data centers. The intrinsic value of the stock is 18% higher than Intel's market capitalization, which means that the target price is $37. Intel generates notably more Data Center revenue compared to wildly overvalued Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD). The company spends much more on R&D than NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and AMD and released its Gaudi 3 accelerator, which is more powerful than Nvidia's H100, according to the company. Nvidia and AMD are fierce competitors, but Intel is well-positioned to get solid gains from the accelerating spending on data centers and AI. Considering Intel's strong exposure to AI and data centers and its very attractive valuation, I think that INTC is a Strong Buy. INTC stock analysis  Sentiment around INTC is weak in 2024 since the stock lost 38% of its value YTD. However, financial performance in Q1 tells me that the market's reaction should be the opposite. Revenue grew by 8.6% compared to the same quarter last year. Profitability is also steadily improving. Data by YCharts The reason for the latest INTC sell-off was softer-than-expected guidance from the management for the remainder of 2024. However, it appears to be a shortsighted reaction because as investors we should pay more attention to longer-term horizons. AI is a big elephant in the room because INTC's AI exposure is solid. Intel's Gaudi 3 AI accelerator is a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100 series. During the Vision 2024 event, Intel's management stated that Gaudi 3 delivers a 50% on average better inference and 40% on average better power efficiency than Nvidia H100. With a more attractive price compared to H100, Gaudi is positioned well to become a popular alternative to H100 series. Moreover, the previous generation, Gaudi 2 proved itself appealing as it powers Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (META) Llama large-language model (LLM). Data by YCharts Nvidia and AMD are unlikely to be the ones standing by as Intel's Gaudi 3 potentially captures their market share. For example, Nvidia's new generation of accelerators called Blackwell is expected to be much more powerful than H100. The AI battle will be fierce, but what I want to underline is that Intel's R&D budget is $7 billion larger than Nvidia's and about $10 billion higher compared to AMD's. Therefore, I believe there is a high probability that Intel can reply to Nvidia's Blackwell with ""Gaudi 4"" soon. Intel also has a solid presence in data centers, with a $3 billion Q1 revenue from its ""Data Center and AI"" business. For example, AMD's ""Data Center"" segment's revenue was $2.3 billion in Q1 2024. Intel's XEON processors are also quite popular in the data center field. Their processors are deployed by Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), the world's leading cloud company. Intel also partners with Microsoft Corporation's (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), (GOOGL) Cloud. Having partnerships with all the largest cloud players means that Intel is extremely well-positioned to benefit from accelerating the data center spending of these giants. Amazon plans to invest $150 billion in data centers over the next 15 years. Such a horizon of 15 years means that the trend is not temporary but secular. The main competitors of AWS have similar ambitions and plans. Statista Firm AI and data center potential are not the only strengths of INTC. The company dominates the x86 laptop CPUs market with a 75% market share, according to statista.com. AMD's market share is more than three times lower and Nvidia is not even in the discussion. Such dominance makes INTC well-positioned to create a new industry of AI laptops, which could also unlock new growth drivers for the company. Intrinsic value calculation Calculating the discount rate for a discounted cash flow (DCF) model is crucial because it affects the present value of future cash flows. Intel's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 8.2%, which was estimated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). My calculations are outlined in the below model, and all assumptions are shown. DT Invest A DCF model also needs revenue and free cash flow assumptions. Consensus estimates are the ones that are usually priced in by the market, so I use consensus for my years 1-5 horizon. Taking a TTM levered FCF margin will not work for INTC because it is negative. At the same time, consensus expects Intel's EPS to demonstrate strong growth over the next five years. Seeking Alpha Therefore, my FCF margin assumption for year one will be INTC's historical average of 4.05%. Due to the expected aggressive EPS growth, I incorporate a 1.5 percentage points yearly FCF improvement. A 3% perpetual growth rate is in line with current inflation levels. Cash is added and total debt is subtracted when I finalize my intrinsic value calculation. My target price is $37 because INTC's intrinsic value is 18% higher than its market capitalization. DT Invest In addition, Intel's current market value is only 25% higher than the book value. It is considered very low when we compare it to an average of 3 from industry averages. Seeking Alpha What can go wrong with my thesis? The competition is intense across all products offered by the company. INTC competes with Nvidia and AMD in the CPU/GPU field, both of them are known for their aggressive growth profiles and their fabless business model makes these players more flexible. New technologies in the industry emerge, which creates new opportunities for previously less-known companies. For example, Arm Holdings plc (ARM) looks like an under-the-radar player compared to Intel's well-known brand, or even NVDA and AMD. However, this business is thriving, and its market cap is higher compared to Intel. Fierce competition is the most significant factor that can make my thesis look bad over time. Seeking Alpha Intel's highly leveraged balance sheet, especially compared to NVDA and AMD, might be an obstacle to the company's success. High debt levels weigh on profitability and limit any company's flexibility in allocating its financial resources. From the perspective of the balance sheet, NVDA and AMD have a competitive advantage over INTC. The semiconductor industry is cyclical and heavily depends on the broader economic environment. Since interest rates remain high in the U.S., some analysts believe that the U.S. will enter a recession either this year or in 2025. The recession will highly likely lead to overall spending softening, which will also affect semiconductors. Moreover, the potential recession might also lead to investors selling off risky assets like stocks and reallocating capital to fixed-income instruments. This will also not be beneficial for my thesis. Summary  Intel's firm exposure to thriving AI and data center domains together with its compelling 18% upside potential makes it a Strong Buy.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

This elite group of stocks comprises companies within the S&P 500 index with a distinguished track record of consistently increasing their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Such an impressive track record reflects both their ability to thrive over multiple financial cycles and market downturns and their commitment to returning capital to shareholders.Given their overall qualities, having the opportunity to buy Dividend Aristocrats trading at historically attractive valuations is particularly compelling‚Äîespecially given that Dividend Aristocrats rarely go on sale. While this is a rare occurrence, a few companies in this select group of stocks are currently trading at cheap valuations‚Äîcheaper, in fact, than those seen in the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. In this article, I have gathered three undervalued Dividend Aristocrats trading this cheaply despite the broader market‚Äôs recent highs.Genuine Parts (GPC)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comThe first of the undervalued Dividend Aristocrats on my list has to be Genuine Parts¬†(NYSE:GPC). It‚Äôs not just any Dividend Aristocrat, but one that has built an extraordinary reputation over the years among income-oriented investors. This is due to its impressive dividend growth history, which few companies can match.Specifically, Genuine Parts stands out with an unparalleled streak of 68 consecutive years of dividend hikes, matched only by Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) among Dividend Aristocrats, which features an equally strong track record. This remarkable track record underscores Genuine Parts‚Äô consistent revenue and earnings growth over the years. The company has successfully navigated through multiple recessions and economic downturns spanning seven decades, which is utterly remarkable.Genuine Parts‚Äô shares have lagged recently despite the company achieving record sales of $23.1 billion last year.¬†Its adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) grew by 11.9% to $9.33 over the same period, also hitting a new record. The recent share price decline against growing financials has led to Genuine Parts stock currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 13.7. This multiple is below some of the levels the stock was trading at in 2008 despite its growth prospects clearly remaining robust.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.comJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is another Dividend Aristocrat trading at dirt-cheap levels. The company continues to have dominant positions in the healthcare and consumer goods sectors through its diverse portfolio of essential pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health products. Yet, the market has been selling off shares of Johnson & Johnson, implying challenges that do not accurately reflect its actual situation.Indeed, consensus estimates anticipate that FY2024 will mark another exceptional year for the company, projecting revenue and EPS growth of 4.2% and 6.3% to reach $88.8 billion and $10.54, respectively‚Äîboth setting new records. Despite these robust financial projections, the parting between performance and stock price has resulted in JNJ shares currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of only 13.9 times. Interestingly, this valuation is lower than certain multiples observed in 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis.In the meantime, Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs dividend growth track record remains exceptional. The company has raised its dividend for 61 consecutive years, one of the most impressive streaks among Dividend Aristocrats. The pace of dividend increases remains highly compelling as well, with its 10-year dividend CAGR standing at a solid 5.3%.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)The last Dividend Aristocrat on my list trading at a rather depressed valuation is Archer-Daniels-Midland¬†(NYSE:ADM). At $60.45 today, ADM stock trades are significantly lower than its 2022 peak of roughly $97 and are nearing the levels it maintained in spring 2021. However, as one of the world‚Äôs largest agricultural processors and food ingredient providers, the company has consistently delivered solid quarterly results over this period.I am quite surprised that the market has turned its back on Archer-Daniels lately, as the company‚Äôs farm products, such as vegetable oils, sweeteners, and plant-based and animal-based proteins, remain critical for meeting our nutritional requirements. For this reason, the company enjoys a recession-proof business, which explains why you will rarely see ADM stock trading going on sale. To illustrate this quality, the company has increased its dividend for 51 years in a row‚Äîa testament to its enduring commitment to shareholders.Valuation-wise, in light of its recent decline, ADM stock is presently trading at a forward P/E ratio of only 11.2 times. This figure is lower than certain valuation points observed during the Great Financial Crisis, which is rather puzzling given the company‚Äôs overall resilience. Coupled with Archer Daniels offering a respectable yield of 3.3%, potential for continued dividend growth at a decent pace, and the prospect of its valuation potentially expanding from current levels, this Dividend Aristocrat presents a compelling opportunity today.On the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The summer of 2023 was a particularly strong travel season with nearly 1/3 of American households taking a vacation. That represented a record dating back to 2015. 2024 is expected to be even stronger. With the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) expecting record-setting volumes, it‚Äôs worth considering hot stocks that you can‚Äôt afford to skip this summer.Two of the three stocks discussed below are directly related to strong expectations surrounding travel. The other has almost no connection to travel trends but is worth watching nonetheless.Anyway, this article is primarily about the uptick in travel expected this summer and stocks that are set to benefit because of it. U.S. consumer confidence is currently lower than it was anticipated to be at this point. Yet, travel is expected to be strong throughout the summer based on volume.Booking Holdings (BKNG)Source: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is an obvious choice for stocks you can‚Äôt afford to skip this summer given everything I‚Äôve just explained. Travel is expected to be high and passenger volumes are expected to reach record levels. Thus, the travel and restaurant reservations Booking Holdings offers should be in high demand.Booking holding certainly has strong catalysts in its favor but the company also has strong fundamentals backing it as a stock choice. The company is undergoing a period of rapid growth.¬†Revenues nearly doubled between 2021 and 2023. The company also increased its overall profitability during that period and generally looks like a strong company overall.It‚Äôs a simple, straightforward investment. Booking Holdings is in the midst of a period of strength at the moment. Demand is forecast to be strong at the same time. It looks like Booking Holdings represents a prime example of not overcomplicating your investment strategy and simply picking well operated companies when the environment is conducive to growth.¬†Southwest Airlines (LUV)Source: Ryan Fletcher / Shutterstock.comSouthwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) is definitely a stock to watch at the moment. It is one of many airlines expected to see greater volumes as travel surges this summer. However, despite that positive news, Southwest Airlines continues to struggle.The company continues to struggle to accurately forecast demand patterns that help it provide guidance to investors. that manifested recently as a further downgrade to revenue per available seat mile (RASM), a measure of pricing power. Airlines continue to add seating and routes which are largely out of Southwest‚Äôs control.The lowered metric indicates that Southwest Airlines has little power over pricing at the moment. However, all is not lost. The company continues to predict record operating revenues during the second quarter. While volumes will be high and cause operating revenues to spike, there are other reasons to believe LUV stock could rise.The company may be forced to oust its current CEO following a period of weak performance. Elliott Investment Management owns $1.9 billion worth of LUV shares and is calling for the ouster of the current management team. Given the fact that LUV‚Äôs share price has fallen by 50% over the last 2 years, it might be exactly what the company needs.¬†Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source: Tobias Arhelger / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a stock that is well-positioned to grow this summer and particularly in the coming weeks.A lot of the current opportunity for AMD relates to weakening sentiment around its primary competitor, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Investors can‚Äôt continue to wonder how much steam is left in Nvidia following its meteoric rise over the past year. Share prices have surged by more than 200% in the last 12 months and Nvidia‚Äôs market capitalization has surged above $3 trillion. Those same investors are wondering how Nvidia can possibly maintain its stranglehold over AI chips while other competitors continue to vie for market share. CEO Jensen Huang stated that Nvidia‚Äôs chips offer the ‚Äúlowest total cost of ownership.‚ÄùThis is obviously where AMD comes into the picture and why it‚Äôs going to make so much sense as an investment over the coming weeks. Nvidia‚Äôs performed extraordinarily well yet Continues to face the same questions that again open an opportunity for AMD as the second best AI chip.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Typically, when an individual becomes disabled, the SSA offers benefits through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. With both programs, there‚Äôs a five-step process that determines if they qualify. In April, a final rule went into place that improves the application process by reducing the administrative burden, helping speed up the decision-making process. Step four of the process will be simplified under the rule. This step specifically focuses on whether an individual can perform any parts of their past work.""This new rule will lessen the burden and time our applicants face when filling out information about their work history and will make it easier for them to focus on the most current and relevant details about their past work,"" Martin O‚ÄôMalley, commissioner of social security said. ""It also improves the quality of the information our frontline workers receive to make decisions, improving customer service, and reducing case processing time and overall wait times."" The new rule officially went into effect at the end of June. Now, applicants will only need to list their last five years of past work. In the past, 15 years of work history was reviewed. Since the work applicants did 15 years ago can be difficult to remember and timely to review, limiting this requirement will help speed up the application process. The SSA also won‚Äôt consider past work that started and stopped in fewer than 30 days. This helps applicants focus on their most relevant work activity, and limits hassles on the part of the application reviewer. Preparing for your retirement?

The SSA is trying to improve its disability program with additional regulation changes.Another way the SSA plans to expand access to the SSI program is by updating the definition of a public assistance household. Starting September 30, the definition of a public assistance household will include those who are part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payments and households where not all members receive public assistance. This will help more households qualify for benefits and will increase some SSI payments.The agency plans to exclude the value of food from SSI benefit calculations starting in September as well. It removes a major barrier many applicants have faced. Those who receive informal help from friends, family, and their communities to afford food have previously been denied SSI assistance.""A vital part of our mission is helping people access crucial benefits, including SSI,"" Commissioner of Social Security Martin O‚ÄôMalley said. ""Simplifying our policies is a common-sense solution that reduces the burden on the public and agency staff and helps promote equity by removing barriers to accessing payments.""The SSA‚Äôs rental subsidy exception is also getting an expansion. Currently, just seven states have the rental subsidy policy in place. In these seven states, rental assistance (i.e. renting at a discounted rate) was less likely to affect a person‚Äôs SSI eligibility and payment amount.

qig1J4fXV1qQatD,Seeking Alpha,bing,Warner Bros. Discovery: Approaching My Buy Price Target (Rating Upgrade),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702592-warner-bros-discovery-approaching-my-buy-price-target-rating-upgrade,2024-07-05 12:43,2024-07-05 12:56,META,,"Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images News Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) is a stock I have suggested readers avoid until far lower quotes appear. My last article in February here explained a rating downgrade to Sell on slowing economic signals and weaker technical trading momentum, with WBD priced around $10 per share. Seeking Alpha - Paul Franke, Warner Bros. Discovery Article, February 19th, 2024 And, following along the path I laid out in February, the stock quote has slipped from $10 to roughly $7 in recent trading sessions. My bearish long-term view of $40 billion in net debt (total debt minus cash) hasn't really changed. Yet, the lower share pricing goes, the more interesting it becomes as a takeover/merger candidate (with another media giant) and unique investment asset with solid compounding potential if/when interest rates retreat into 2025. I have mixed feelings on the immediate direction for interest rates, although lower rates are not impossible. At this stage, higher rates will hurt the economy (consumer demand for streaming services), in addition to dropping Wall Street valuations of businesses with extra debt. For sure, if we continue to experience a soft landing with falling inflation and interest rates over the next 6-12 months, Warner Bros. Discovery could reverse the trend into a big equity winner from $7. Overall, I feel it prudent to raise my rating to Hold from Sell, based on the price approaching my $5 target made earlier in the year. Let's review some of the changes in my Warner Bros. Discovery outlook since February. Business Description - Warner Bros. Discovery, Q1 2024 Earnings Release Positive Business Developments On May 8th, the company announced a bundling deal with Disney (DIS). Including the Disney-controlled Hulu service, the new service looks like direct competition for cable providers. According to the press release, Beginning this summer in the U.S., the streaming services will be offered together, providing subscribers with the best value in entertainment and an unprecedented selection of content from the biggest and most beloved brands in entertainment including ABC, CNN, DC, Discovery, Disney, Food Network, FX, HBO, HGTV, Hulu, Marvel, Pixar, Searchlight, and Warner Bros. Honestly, if Disney adds ESPN sports to this package eventually, third-party distributors like Sling TV and cable providers may find it difficult to compete for a comprehensive offering of content. Assuming monthly subscription prices are lower (cutting out the middleman between consumers and content creators) with ad-tiers available to consumers, the bundling of streaming services could be quite disruptive for the delivery of studio movies, network television entertainment, video productions for the masses, and other digital media. Rumors this week (July 1st) also place Warner Bros. Discovery in discussions with Paramount Global (PARA) (PARAA) on a partnership deal for their streaming content. Without doubt, WBD's share price slide could be reversed on the right type of agreement, with even stronger cash flow potential in the future vs. current forecasts. Further, if WBD can pull the Paramount+ content into its bundling deal with Disney, I believe Netflix (NFLX) may slip from its king-of-the-hill position for studio-created media delivered online in America. The 2024 Hulu+ and Disney+ bundle with ads for $9.99 a month is probably the correct direction for the industry. The new combined Disney+ homepage moves viewers from hundreds of entertainment options to literally thousands (including series episodes). Adding Warner Bros. Discovery content could be a real eye-opener for the streaming industry. Plus, if a partnership deal with Paramount's free-to-view PlutoTV is reached (for older, rerun type content) and bundled in the Disney/Warner Bros. Discovery setup, traditional cable companies could be in deep trouble. Disney has been looking for a way to become the top choice in streaming for years. The partnership and bundling angle could actually turn Disney into the leading streaming distributor, finally passing Netflix for consumer desirability. Back in 2016, I did mention CEO Robert Iger should buy out (merge with) Netflix here, and consolidate pretty much the whole streaming marketplace under Disney√¢¬Ä¬ôs name. Since then, Disney (the largest Hollywood studio by revenue) has been playing catch up. Low Valuation on High Debt It√¢¬Ä¬ôs hard to ignore, Warner Bros. Discovery has one of the highest debt totals of any media/studio/streaming company out there. As such, the stock deserves a lower-than-normal valuation vs. peers and competitors. Investors are attracted to entertainment names, nevertheless, with the group usually trading at premium valuations to the S&P 500. The unanswered question is, can WBD pay down its debts and grow the business at the same time? Below, I have drawn the most basic enterprise value ratios, which include both debt and equity added together. EV to forward 2024 estimates for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of 6x and revenues of 1.4x place WBD as one of the cheapest industry choices, if you zero out its debt.   YCharts - Warner Bros. Discovery, Enterprise Value to Forward 2024 EBITDA & Sales, Since April 2022 Merger Compared to peers Paramount Global, Disney, Netflix (NFLX), AMC Networks (AMCX), Lionsgate Studios (LION), Warner Music Group (WMG), Roku (ROKU), Alphabet-Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Spotify (SPOT), Warner Bros. Discovery looks quite inexpensive. Only the two problem children (from excessive debts and little earnings) of Paramount and AMC Networks are priced like WBD.   YCharts - Warner Bros. Discovery vs. Streaming Peers, EV to Forward EBITDA, 6 Months   YCharts - Warner Bros. Discovery vs. Streaming Peers, EV to Forward Sales, 6 Months Free Cash Flow One-time asset sales and operating cash flows have pumped the accounting concept of ""free"" cash flow above $7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. With a sliding stock quote over the whole span, free cash flow yield on the equity value of the company has risen to 42%! Again, this rate ranks as one of the best in the group, which is a good thing for value investors. I will say normalized free cash flow generation, in my research, should be in the $3 to $4 billion range going forward, equal to roughly 20% to 25% in free cash flow yield, depending on fluctuating stock quote levels.   YCharts - Warner Bros. Discovery vs. Streaming Peers, Trailing Free Cash Flow Yield, 1 Year In fact, asset sales have jumped annual operating cash flow to $8.7 billion vs. around $2 billion for interest expense. As investors, our research work involves figuring out how cash flows and interest costs will change in the future.   YCharts - Warner Bros. Discovery, Consolidated Cash Flow vs. Interest Expense, 2 Years Mountain of Debt Unfortunately for WBD shareholders, too much debt and slow sales growth do not mix well historically. It's the main reason share pricing has been under pressure over the last year. For a bit of good news, nearly all debt at the end of 2023 was financed at fixed rates in the 4% to 5% range, with maturities beyond five years. So, there is no immediate risk of bankruptcy, assuming cash flows remain steady. If the company commits all of its free cash flow to debt reduction, interest expense will likely slide lower year after year, with other variables remaining the same. SEC 10-K Filing - Warner Bros. Discovery, FY 2023 However, as a percentage of sales, total interest expense stands at a whopping 5% rate! In comparison, Disney's ""high"" level of debt costs 2.2% of sales to finance, Paramount leverage represents 3% of revenue, while AMC Networks spends 5.7%. My guess is, the stock quote will not rise appreciably until this number gets back to 3% to 4% (outside of a takeover/merger with another media giant), which may not happen for years.   YCharts - Warner Bros. Discovery, Net Financial Debt & Interest Expense as Percentage of Sales, 3 Years Using my guesstimate of recurring free cash flow in the $3-4 billion range annually, it would take a theoretical 10-13 years for Warner Bros. Discovery to become debt free. But, if we sprinkle on the positive sales effects of inflation (with rising digital subscription prices) and continued industry growth in streaming vs. traditional avenues of media viewership (with better advertising revenue at WBD), the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs debt situation could look materially better in the next 3-5 years. My opinion is that the equity price could be getting close to zigzagging higher year after year, sooner rather than later, anticipating and discounting a gradually healthier balance sheet over time. Chart Pattern Trying to Bottom? Healthier technical momentum is also starting to appear on the charts, which could be a leading indicator that WBD's price will eventually bottom this year. The Negative Volume Index reached a low in April (circled in red below). NVI gives a readout of trading activity on lower volume days, with a rising trend often signaling a lack of overhead share supply. Very bullish action can be found in the On Balance Volume indicator. Bottoming in late February (circled in green), more net volume has been appearing on up days vs. down closes. May and June in particular have been terrific months for OBV, which can be rare for a stock declining in price. Lastly, the 14-day Ease of Movement calculation has to a degree flatlined in recent months. This usually takes place when there is relative balance between daily buying and selling results. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs the opposite situation of August 2023 (boxed in blue), where a large EMV drop explained an overwhelming imbalance of selling. Since that setup, the price has declined from $13 to $7 over ten months. StockCharts.com - Warner Bros. Discovery, 12 Months of Daily Price & Volume Changes, Author Reference Final Thoughts I am personally waiting for quotes under $5 to start buying, which may or may not materialize into the autumn months. To me, Warner Bros. Discovery is still a work in progress, not exactly ready for prime time. Given a recession begins soon or fears of one get louder, a general market decline of -15% to -20% could provide the excuse for another push lower in WBD shares. My summary for bearish logic (investment risk) is recession odds remain elevated, while it could take a few quarters before Wall Street finds confidence in the effort to bundle streaming content. If you have held all the way down from the WarnerMedia/Discovery merger price of $25 in April 2022, most of the damage to your account has already been done. At this point, holding through $5 and perhaps $4 in a recession scenario may still work out a few years from now. I can see $10, $15, even $20 for upside over time, given lower interest rates keep borrowing/refinancing costs in check and a new economic cycle improves streaming pricing power. In the meantime, company management is trying to move cash √¢¬Ä¬úearnings√¢¬Ä¬ù generation into the plus column. Warner Bros. Discover has plenty of cash flow, yes. Income generation, not so much. If EPS surprises to the upside with $0.30 to $0.40 yearly numbers in 18-24 months, there shouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be appreciable investment risk buying shares around $5 later in 2024. Seeking Alpha Table - Warner Bros. Discovery, Analyst Estimates for 2024-26, Made July 2nd, 2024 Again, the primary risk of owning WBD right now is that a severe and prolonged recession could move sales numbers in reverse, making it more difficult to cash flow debt payments (like interest expense, maturing debt, and/or reducing outstanding loans). The only saving grace in a worst-case economic contraction is that the majority of Warner Bros. Discovery debt is fixed at low borrowing rates for an extended period of time. Without the fixed-rate debt advantage over other media assets, I really wouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt have any desire to own WBD. When you add up all the pros and cons, I feel Warner Bros. Discovery is close to bottoming in price. It is definitely positioned in better shape than my last article in February. I am upgrading my view to Hold. Like I have mentioned, it is an attractive buy-on-weakness idea, especially if the price performs in line with percentage declines in the S&P 500 and peer streaming industry, during an overdue market correction.  Thanks for reading. Please consider this article a first step in your due diligence process.

pEBE5V44wnejWMJ,BBC,bing,Hilary Benn is new Northern Ireland secretary,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx827v8rxzyo,2024-07-05 12:43,2024-07-05 12:58,COST,,"Hilary Benn has been appointed the new Northern Ireland secretary following the Labour Party's general election victory. Mr Benn is a veteran parliamentarian and has represented Leeds Central in the House of Commons since 1999. He had been the shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland since September 2023. He also served in the cabinet from 2003 to 2010 under Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. More recently, he served as shadow foreign secretary and chairman of the Brexit select committee. Mr Benn is the son of former cabinet minister and veteran left-wing campaigner Tony Benn, who also served in Labour cabinets in the 1960s and 70s. During his time as the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Mr Benn was vocal on issues such as the Legacy Act, the redevelopment of Casement Park and the restoration of power sharing. The Troubles Legacy Act was passed in September despite opposition from all of Northern Ireland's political parties, several victims' groups and the Labour Party. It ended historical inquests and transferred of Troubles-era cases to a new body known as the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR). It also provided a conditional amnesty for people suspected of crimes committed during the Troubles and introduces a ban on inquests and future civil actions related to the Troubles era. The High Court later ruled this clause was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. In May, Mr Benn said Labour would remove the immunity element from the act because of the High Court ruling, although he noted the government had appealed. Mr Benn said his party would also restore civil cases and inquests. Speaking about the ICRIR, he said: ""I would not scrap it, I will see how it goes. In the end the test for this is will it work for families. ""In the end if families find that ICRIR works for them - and there are some reforms that we could make to boost confidence in it - then that will put us in a much, much better place than where we are at the moment."" Labour could not ""write a blank cheque"" to rebuild Casement Park in west Belfast in time for Euro 2028, Mr Benn said in June. Speaking to Good Morning Ulster, Mr Benn said everyone ""would like Casement to be built"" in time for the tournament. He said it was not clear what the final cost of the project would be. When the stadium was first proposed in 2011, the estimated cost was ¬£76m with ¬£61m coming from Northern Ireland's power-sharing government at Stormont and ¬£15m from the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), which owns the ground. However it is now suggested the stadium could cost more than ¬£300m. ""The question is, where is the rest of the very considerably increased amount of money that will be required?"" said Mr Benn. ""I can‚Äôt give a blank cheque and you wouldn‚Äôt expect me to given the huge rise in the costs there have been and we don‚Äôt yet know what the full sum is."" He added there is a responsibility on the UK government to make a contribution but that he would commit to sitting down with all parties to see whether they could ""contribute more"". Mr Benn was involved in cross-party talks aimed at restoring the Stormont institutions when he was shadow secretary of state.  He welcomed the deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) brought about the return to devolution in Northern Ireland in February. Asked for his views on potential reform of the power-sharing rules to prevent future collapses of the institutions, Mr Benn insisted the responsibility for stability lay with locally-elected politicians. ‚ÄúWhen we stand for office, our constituents expect us to go to work and do our job, not to say ‚Äòwell, actually there‚Äôs a reason why we don‚Äôt want to participate in the institutions‚Äô,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just have this feeling that after all of the ups and downs and the start and stop there has been, this is a particular moment, it seems to me, for the future of Northern Ireland, and that the people who can ensure that the institutions endure are the politicians who are working in this place. ‚ÄúI really hope that that is going to be the case, because it‚Äôs the best thing for the people of Northern Ireland, for its economic future and for the functioning of a power-sharing democracy here.‚Äù As Northern Ireland Secretary, Mr Benn is the only person with the power to call a referendum on Irish unity, known as a border poll.  He has defended his party leader's view that a vote is ‚Äúnot even on the horizon‚Äù. The remark was made by Sir Keir Starmer to BBC News NI in October. But Mr Benn said it ‚Äúreflected the current reality‚Äù. He was asked about the issue at a fringe meeting of the Labour conference in Liverpool. He replied: ""The conditions in which a border poll would be held are very, very clear.  ""They‚Äôre set out in the Good Friday Agreement and everyone‚Äôs read it and everyone knows what it says."" At the time, when Stormont was still not sitting, he said the priority was restoring it rather than a border poll. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Now, AI Has Helped Ballmer Surpass Gates On The Billionaire's IndexSteve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft, was one of Bill Gates‚Äô early hires, joining the company in 1980 as its 30th employee. After dropping out of Stanford Business School, he joined as an assistant to the president, serving more as a business manager than a PA to the owner and CEO, Bill Gates.Don't Miss:Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital.

eNucCbipFLpyH7w,Yahoo Finance,bing,5 Affordable Items That Save Me Money When I Travel,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-affordable-items-save-money-170015729.html,2024-07-05 13:05,2024-07-05 13:20,COST,,"Image source: Getty ImagesI love to travel, but I also love to save money. Unfortunately, those two things don't often go hand in hand. Scour all the flight deal websites you want, but you're still going to have to pony up some cash to get a plane ticket. And that beachside hotel, or guided mountain hike, or five-star restaurant meal? Don't expect those to come cheap, either.Since I'm not willing to stay home and leave the world unexplored, I've started testing out other ways to save money while I travel. Here are a few that work well for me.Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards1. Packing cubesGive me the option of checking a bag or going carry-on only, and I'm picking carry-on. I prefer to keep all of my possessions within eyesight for several reasons: I want to avoid the waiting game at the baggage carousel, I don't want to stress about lost luggage, and I don't want to pay a checked bag fee.The average cost for a single checked bag is $30 to $35 -- one way. A roundtrip flight can cost an extra $70 with a checked bag. A set of compression packing cubes, on the other hand, can cost less than $20 and shrink down your wardrobe into a small enough pile to fit in a carry-on bag.After one trip, you'd be ahead $50. And since these bags can last as many years as you can take care of them, you're in a good position to save hundreds of dollars on checked bag fees.2. Bar of laundry soapAnother trick to keep my packing list down for longer trips is to wear items more than once. That way, I can stick to my carry-on bag rather than bring half my closet with me. One really affordable way to do this is to pack a bar of laundry soap. Again, this small investment can save me $70 roundtrip on checked bag fees.I purchased a solid laundry soap bar for around $12 a year and a half ago, and it still has a lot of sudsy life left. It tucks away easily into my luggage and allows me to hand-wash some of my clothing items while I travel, meaning I get to pack lighter. It's also great for spot-cleaning small stains and spills while on the road, so I can eat salsa-covered tacos al pastor to my heart's content.3. Google MapsAffordable is great, but free is even better. I like to save the offline version of Google Maps for the areas I'll be traveling before I head out on a trip. This allows me to search and navigate without having to pay for wifi or cell service.I spent a week driving the south coast of Iceland last summer, and Google Maps was a great money saver. Rather than paying my cellphone service provider $10 per day, I just downloaded Google Maps for the area ahead of time, saving me $70. I was even able to get directions to a crepe truck next to a glacier lagoon with zero cell service. Technology is wild.Story continues4. Travel guidebooks from the libraryI interned one summer at a travel guidebook publisher, so I still have a soft spot for doing some of my trip planning out of a book. However, I don't love the idea of paying for an entire guidebook that I'll likely only use part of, and only use once.My husband came up with the idea of checking out travel guidebooks from the library to do some of our research before a trip. This gives us access to a lot of well-vetted travel tips and detailed maps for exactly zero dollars, all while supporting our local library. Win-win, I say.5. Rewards credit cardsI don't have a very deep roster of credit cards in my wallet, but it's a very targeted collection. For travel credit cards, I've selected two that match my spending and travel habits to not only earn me rewards but also provide perks I'll use for my vacations.I have a cobranded credit card for an airline that I fly with often. It includes free checked bags, priority boarding, and two annual airport lounge passes among its perks, saving me quite a bit each year. I also have a general travel credit card that earns bonus points on all my travel-related spending. I'm able to earn extra reward points that I can then redeem for future travel, making my vacations cheaper.Many rewards credit cards come with an annual fee, but depending on how many of the perks you can benefit from, you can come out well ahead in the end.Save money without spending a lotIf you'd like to travel more but have trouble making it work for your budget, give some of these tips a try. By keeping your checked baggage fees down, taking advantage of free planning options, and making rewards credit cards work for you, you'll be able to get out and see the world with a lot less worry.Alert: highest cash back card we've seen now has 0% intro APR until 2025This credit card¬†is not just good ‚Äì it's so exceptional that our experts use it personally. It¬†features a 0% intro APR for 15 months, a cash back rate of up to 5%, and all somehow for no annual fee!¬†Click here to read our full review for free and apply in just 2 minutes.

Shares fell as much as 2% on Friday, compared with a gain of nearly 1% for the Nasdaq 100 Index.Additional upside ‚Äúwill only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet,‚Äù said Ferragu.While the ‚Äúquality of the franchise is nevertheless intact,‚Äù there is, ‚Äúif anything, a risk of derating‚Äù should the current outlook remain unchanged, he added.The downgrade is rare for a company that has become the biggest beneficiary of the artificial intelligence spending boom.

NCHUT65TDn7an3g,The Motley Fool,google,Why NextEra Energy Partners Stock Slumped 18% in June,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/05/why-nextera-energy-partners-stock-slumped-18-june/,2024-07-05 13:19,2024-07-05 13:26,NEE,,"NextEra Energy Partners (NEP -1.12%) stock gained solid momentum in May, but the euphoria only lasted so long. The renewable energy stock slumped 18% in June, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, wiping out all of its gains through May and some. As of this writing, shares of NextEra Energy Partners are now down 13% this year amid fears of a dividend cut.Analyst downgrades hit the renewable energy stockNextEra Energy Partners stock plunged in 2023 after the company blamed funding constraints amid high interest rates and slashed its dividend growth goal through 2026 by almost half to 5% to 8% per year with an annual target of 6%. Last month though, NextEra Energy Partners reaffirmed its dividend growth target, but investors and analysts are skeptical.Barclays analyst Christine Cho cut NextEra Energy Partners stock's price target to $25 a share from $32 per share in June in light of the company's upcoming debt maturities. If NextEra Energy Partners cannot raise more funds, Cho fears it may have to cut its dividend by as much as 45% to 75% to repay debt worth $3.7 billion maturing between 2026 and 2032.RBC Capital is the latest to ring the warning bells on NextEra Energy Partners, with analyst Shelby Tucker cutting the stock's price target to $30 per share from $38 a share. Tucker, too, is concerned about the renewable energy giant's upcoming debt repayments and expects the company's cash flows from wind repowerings to fall short. For those in the know, NextEra Energy Partners plans to repower its wind assets to boost cash flows in the coming years.With several analysts warning about a potential dividend cut, investors have been quick to dump NextEra Energy Partners stock in recent weeks.What should you do with NextEra Energy Partners stock now?In its 2023 annual report, NextEra Energy Partners revealed that it had a ""minimum"" of $1.3 billion, $700 million, and around $2 billion in long-term debt maturing annually in 2024, 2025, and 2026, respectively. That's nearly $4 billion of debt repayment coming up in less than two years even as the company had cash and cash equivalents worth only $245 million as of March 31.If these numbers are anything to go by, fears about NextEra Energy Partners' dividend growth aren't entirely unfounded. The company's projected dividend payout ratio of mid-90% through 2026 also leaves no room for error. However, with the stock's dividend yield hitting 13%, the worst may already be baked into the stock's price. The upside, though, could still be limited as investors tread with caution in the medium term.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shaw & Co.After graduating from Princeton in 1986 with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science, Bezos worked his way up Wall Street. He took a job with the new hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co. and became a vice president in four years.In a Frontline PBS interview, Andreas Weigend, former chief scientist at Amazon, explains that D.E. Shaw revolutionized Wall Street by introducing data. Bezos leaned into this, believing that companies using data were more likely to succeed.During his tenure, David Shaw, founder of D. E. Shaw & Co., tasked Bezos with investigating new business possibilities, including Internet use, then called the World Wide Web. Bezos found that web use was growing by 2300% per year, which led him to search for a business plan that would align with that rapid growth.Discover More: I‚Äôm a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn‚Äôt SellFind Out: 3 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their MoneyBrett_Hondow / iStock.comFounds Amazon.comIn 1994, Bezos and his wife, Mackenzie, moved to Seattle, where he founded Amazon.com with a $10,000 personal investment along with $84,000 in interest-free loans over the next 18 months. [3]¬† He decided to sell books online. He chose books because there are more items in the book category than any other by a wide margin. Selling books allowed him to build an online store with more available items than any brick-and-mortar store had. Because of this large selection, Bezos named his company after the world‚Äôs largest river, the Amazon.Amazon.com officially opened on July 16, 1995, and quickly grew successful. In the first month, Amazon sold books to states across the U.S. and 45 foreign countries without using paid promotion. By the end of the second month, its sales reached $20,000 a week.Amazon‚Äôs business model had two major advantages over other businesses. First was its vast selection. Bezos is on record saying that if someone printed out Amazon‚Äôs entire catalog on paper, it would equate to the size of seven New York City phone books. The second advantage was its new convenience, with products shipped right to the customer‚Äôs door.Story continuesTrending Now: Here‚Äôs How Much a $1,000 Investment in Ford Stock 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth TodayPrykhodov / Getty Images/iStockphotoAmazon Goes PublicOn May 15, 1997, Amazon went public with a valuation of $300 million. The company appeared on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol AMZN. The initial public offering (IPO) was $18 per share and grew to $23.50 by the close. The IPO gave Amazon a market valuation of about $560 million. However, Amazon wasn‚Äôt yet a profitable business.In a letter to shareholders after Amazon went public, Bezos explained that the business strategy was to forego profits in the short term to take market share. This meant that Amazon would lose money to put companies that couldn‚Äôt compete out of business.Another advantage Bezos took advantage of to quickly grow and monopolize the book-selling industry was taxes. Brick-and-mortar businesses were required to charge sales tax for all purchases. However, online businesses didn‚Äôt need to charge sales tax, which saved customers money. As Amazon began expanding into a retailer beyond books, the lack of sales tax continued to be a great advantage.Bezos further expanded his empire by turning Amazon into a retail platform where thousands of other brick-and-mortar businesses could sell their products online. This move brought in big-name stores as well as small entrepreneurs, resulting in millions of dollars in profit for Amazon.Elnur / Shutterstock.comTime Magazine‚Äôs Person of the YearWith Amazon‚Äôs expansion into retail beyond books, the world began to take notice. On Dec. 27, 1999, Bezos graced the cover of Time magazine as ‚ÄúPerson of the Year.‚ÄùAt 35 years old, he was the fourth youngest person to receive the honor after Charles Lindbergh, Martin Luther King Jr. and Queen Elizabeth II. His Time article referenced how he used his genius to replace old-fashioned stores with a new style of centralized sales and shipping centers guided by the Internet.In 1999, he had already amassed a net worth of $7.8 billion and ranked #18 on the Forbes list of richest Americans.¬©Blue OriginFounds Blue OriginIn 2000, Bezos founded a new company with very different goals than Amazon.com. While in high school, Bezos said in a newspaper article, ‚ÄúThe earth is finite, and if the world economy and population is to keep expanding, space is the only way to go.‚ÄùWith this in mind, he created Blue Origin. The company, named after the planet Earth, manufactures space vehicles and guided missiles and embarks on space exploration. To get the company started, Bezos funded the space company with at least $5.5 billion from his own pockets.On July 20, 2021, Blue Origin launched its first commercial flight to space and back. The launch vehicle, New Shephard, completed a 10-minute flight into space. It carried four civilian passengers, including Bezos and his brother Mark. The first ticket on New Shephard received over 7,500 bids from 159 different countries. The seat sold for $28 million.Since that launch, Blue Origin has joined SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (ULA) to compete for a rocket contract in the Pentagon‚Äôs $5.6 billion National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program.¬†It‚Äôs raised $500 million in funding and has nearly 11,000 employees.Read More: 3 Types of Investments Predicted To Plummet in Value in Summer 2024Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comStarts Amazon PrimeIn February 2005, Bezos made a risky decision to start the now-popular membership service Amazon Prime. Originally members paid $79 annually for free two-day shipping on eligible purchases in the U.S. This membership for free shipping started out as a significant expense for Amazon. However, Amazon Prime proved profitable as members began to order through Amazon over other retailers because of the free shipping.Over the years, Amazon has added more features to its membership, including Prime Video, Prime Reading and Amazon Photos, as well as various discounts and deals. Amazon Prime also adjusted its shipping time to same-day or one-day delivery. In 2015, Amazon even created a shopping holiday based around the subscription service called Amazon Prime Day. Along with these added benefits, the price has also risen to $14.99 per month or $139 per year.Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comInitiates Amazon Web ServicesAmazon made another significant expansion in 2006. It launched the cloud computing business Amazon Web Services (AWS). Customers use AWS to power their infrastructure and applications to lower business costs and improve innovation. It offers pay-as-you-go pricing for technology services that members can use to improve their applications, like computing, storage, databases, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI).AWS was a way for Bezos to diversify Amazon‚Äôs business and create new revenue streams from independent retail operations, and it has proven effective. In the first quarter of 2024, AWS was responsible for $25 billion in revenue, exceeding the expectations of $24.5 billion.JurgaR / Getty ImagesReleases First KindleIn the mid 2000‚Äôs, Amazon continued to break barriers and innovate. Bezos changed the publishing industry forever with the release of the Amazon Kindle on Nov. 19, 2007. The first Kindle retailed for $400. While e-book readers already existed, the Kindle would grow to be the device that changed the industry.Today, the Amazon Kindle comes in various shapes and sizes and has all sorts of capabilities. Kindles have up to 64 GB in storage, writing capability with a battery free pen, internet connectivity and weeks of battery life. Consumers can purchase a Kindle for under $100 now.To further enhance the value of Amazon‚Äôs Kindle, Amazon rolled out the Kindle Unlimited subscription service in 2014. This allows readers to access over 4 million titles digitally through their Kindle, browse from included magazine subscriptions and listen to thousands of audiobooks. The Amazon Kindle and Kindle Unlimited continue to grow the value of Amazon today.Explore More: 10 Things You Should Do When Your Child‚Äôs 529 Account Reaches $20,000LPETTET / Getty ImagesAcquires ZapposZappos.com, an online shoe and clothing retailer, got Bezos‚Äôs attention in 2009.

Employees received an additional $40 million worth of cash and restricted stock units.Zappos didn‚Äôt merge with Amazon but instead ran independently. Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh equated the matter to continuing on with the same business and culture but switching the shareholders and board of directors.Radu Bercan / Shutterstock.comBuys The Washington PostIn¬† 2013, Bezos made a big move and purchased the Washington Post newspaper. It ¬†had belonged to the Graham family for 80 years before Bezos bought it for $250 million. Before the sale, the entire newspaper industry had been struggling to adapt to consumers‚Äô move toward the internet.Within three years of the purchase, the newspaper had become profitable and doubled its web traffic. Bezos turned the failing newspaper away from an outlet focused on print and moved it into the digital age. By 2017, the newspaper‚Äôs digital-only subscribers had exceeded one million. Bezos has publicly stated that when he is 90 years old, he will be most proud of helping the Washington Post through such a rough time and making it a successful newspaper once again.However, leading the newspaper company has proven challenging, as it‚Äôs been hit with recent setbacks such as losing $77 million in 2023, a sharp decline in website traffic, a newsroom revolt, and the sudden departure of its new executive editor.Susan Vineyard / Getty ImagesAcquires Whole Foods MarketBezos made another unexpected move in 2017 by acquiring Whole Foods Market and stepping into the brick-and-mortar space. The high-end supermarket chain, which features organic and natural products, sold for $13.7 billion, making it one of the largest Amazon acquisitions.This allowed Amazon to bolster its Amazon Fresh grocery service, which delivers food products ordered online to most U.S. cities.For You: In 5 Years, These 2 Stocks Will Be More Valuable Than AppleSARINYAPINNGAM / iStock.comBecomes the Richest Person in the WorldIn 2018, Forbes released the 32nd Annual World Billionaires List, and Bill Gates was not at the top.

At the time of the divorce, Bezos was the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $118 billion.The divorce settlement was record-breaking as Mackenzie received a 4% stake in Amazon, which amounts to a value of $35.6 billion.Although other financial details of the divorce weren‚Äôt released, Bezos kept ownership of The Washington Post and Blue Origin. Bezos‚Äôs ex-wife, now referred to as Mackenzie Scott, is the 35th most wealthy person in the world.400tmax / iStock.comSteps Down as CEO of AmazonExactly 27 years after founding Amazon, Bezos stepped down from the CEO position. It was a sentimental date that Bezos chose himself. He will remain a prominent voice for Amazon, transitioning to executive chairman of the board. He hopes to devote more time to other projects, particularly The Washington Post and Blue Origin.With all of the ups and downs of Bezos‚Äôs business ventures and personal life, he has constantly found ways to succeed.

Mark Gordon, Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins, and other elected officials from local and state government.‚ÄúI‚Äôm really proud to welcome Meta to Cheyenne and Wyoming,‚Äù Collins said to announce the business behind Project Cosmo, followed by applause from attendees.Meta Director of Community and Economic Development for Data Centers Bradley Davis said this development will create around 1,000 construction jobs over the next two years, and establish 100 permanent jobs in the area.Davis described the data center as the engine that allows them to power apps and services like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Simply put, it is a series of network computers that will store, process and transmit data around the globe. This data center, in particular, is being designed specifically to handle artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cutting-edge technology,‚Äù Davis said. ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt be more excited to have it here in Cheyenne.‚ÄùWhen Collins first met with Meta about the project, he shared concerns about water usage in the area. Davis said it is a goal of the company to work with the needs of the communities where they develop data centers. In response, Meta chose to use a closed-loop liquid system, which Davis said is the most water-efficient option.In addition, he said the center, located on a 960-acre parcel of land in the High Plains Business Park, will be powered 100% by renewable energy sources.While the development worked in partnership with Black Hills Energy, Meta has yet to identify which renewable energy projects they will be using, but they are currently evaluating options.Dustin McKen, Black Hills Energy program manager for Wyoming, said that if they are selected as the energy provider for the project, they will likely have to create or purchase renewable energy from other providers to transport to Cheyenne and provide to Meta to meet their renewable energy goal. He also noted that Black Hills customers should not expect to see any rate increases if they are selected as the energy provider.Davis did not say how much water or energy use is estimated at this facility, but noted that Meta publishes annual environmental impact reports for all their data centers. He said he anticipates the numbers will be comparable to existing data centers of a similar size.Story continuesThough it is difficult to tell how much energy the project will need, some comparable data centers may provide some insight. Meta‚Äôs Stanton Springs Data Center in Newton County, Georgia, was a $1 billion investment in 2018, so it is slightly larger than Cheyenne‚Äôs facility. According to Meta environmental data reports, that facility consumed 636,266 megawatt hours in 2022, which is enough energy to power nearly 60,000 U.S. homes based on average annual consumption. In the same year, it emitted 535 metric tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to the average emissions of 116 cars per year.Lummis said it is important to keep energy production and consumption inside the Cowboy State.‚ÄúWyoming produces 12 times more energy than it consumes. And we‚Äôve gotten in the habit of taking our raw materials and sending them elsewhere,‚Äù said Lummis, who is from Cheyenne. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs not the future of Wyoming. The future of Wyoming is generating our industry for use in our own state, by our own people, with industries that we invite in,‚Äù she said. ‚Äú... Because we do it well, we can provide affordable, abundant, redundant energy provided by people who can make it cleaner than anywhere in the world.‚ÄùCollins expressed his excitement at the potential for millions of dollars in state and local taxes as a result of the project.‚ÄúMeta, I just want to say thank you for your investment in our community, and for the great partnership I know we‚Äôre going to have for years to come,‚Äù he said.Davis said he envisioned this partnership as one where the trillion-dollar corporation can give back to the community in some way.Meta‚Äôs community action grants program provides direct funding to schools, registered nonprofits and community organizations in locations where they have a data center. In Eagle Mountain, Utah, where Meta has a data center, Meta awarded an average of $210,000 in these grants to the community between 2020 and 2023.The new facility will be Meta‚Äôs 25th data center worldwide, and it is expected to go online in 2027.View comments",0.0,True,"Meta, formerly known as Facebook, is developing an $800 million data center in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

""However, it appears to be a shortsighted reaction because as investors we should pay more attention to longer-term horizons."" ""Intel generates notably more Data Center revenue compared to wildly overvalued Advanced Micro Devices,"" DT Invest added.

kmpm7GvuMnVb97d,Seeking Alpha,google,AMD Stock: AI GPU Underdog With Serious Catalysts (Rating Upgrade) (NASDAQ:AMD),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702621-amd-ai-gpu-underdog-with-serious-catalysts-rating-upgrade,2024-07-05 14:19,2024-07-05 14:30,NVDA,,"MF3d Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have risen more than 41% in the last year, but are still widely trailing behind Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), which absolutely crushed expectations in the last year. Although AMD is lagging Nvidia in terms of its GPU proposition, the company is set to debut new products and ramp up shipments of the Instinct MI300X accelerator in FY 2024, which is meant to support AI workloads. AMD is also accelerating its GPU roadmap and looks to launch new Instinct chips in Q4 '24 as well as FY 2025. These products are set to create significant top line and free cash flow tailwinds for AMD, and could help narrow the gap between AMD's and Nvidia's valuation! Data by YCharts Previous rating I rated shares of AMD a hold in February 2024 -- AMD Could Soon Have Its 'Nvidia Moment' -- as AMD benefits from a tipping point in AI√¢¬Ä¬¶ which means companies are accelerating spending on the companies√¢¬Ä¬ô AI chips to scale their own businesses. AMD last month revealed two more processors that will be launched, the AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors which are built on AMD√¢¬Ä¬ôs XDNA 2 architecture, as well as the AMD Ryzen 9000 Series processors for desktops that are built on the AMD Zen 5 architecture. AMD is also accelerating efforts to increase the line-up of its Instinct accelerators, which could lead to significant free cash flow tailwinds. New product launches are set to challenge Nvidia AMD is going to launch two processors in the near term, the AI 300 Series for laptops (set to launch July 17, 2024) and the Ryzen 9000 Series processors for desktops (shipments to start in August 2024). The AI 300 Series is aimed at content creators that need to handle demanding AI workloads. Both chips could provide tailwinds and catalysts for the company's main processor business. More importantly, however, AMD said in Q2'24 that it is accelerating its GPU product pipeline in a bid to become more competitive with Nvidia's H100. AMD already launched the Instinct MI300X accelerator earlier this year, which is meant to directly challenge Nvidia's leading position in the Data Center GPU market. Nvidia is leading the market by a mile, which has translated to soaring profits for the chipmaker: Profit Explosion And Stock Split Are Game-Changers. As per information from Wells Fargo, Nvidia continues to have a massive 94% share in the Data Center GPU market. AMD is trailing far behind with a market share of slightly more than 4%, but the increasing density of AMD√¢¬Ä¬ôs AI chip line-up could mount an effective challenge here and take some market share away from Nvidia in the coming quarters. Wells Fargo, Eric Flaningam The reason I say this is that demand for AI GPUs is soaring, and Nvidia alone cannot fill the demand. With demand outstripping supply, AMD could be a big beneficiary here as it accelerates its own product release pipeline and its MI300 accelerator shipments likely picked up in Q2 '24. AMD is further looking to release the AMD Instinct MI325X accelerator in Q4 '24 and the AMD Instinct MI350 Series in FY 2025. The MI350 Series, according to information provided by AMD, offers ""up to a 35x increase in AI inference performance compared to AMD Instinct MI300 Series"" which could make AMD's chips increasingly interesting as an alternative to the high-priced H100 chips that Nvidia is selling. The AMD Instinct MI400 series is expected to debut in FY 2026, meaning AMD is moving closer to a yearly release cycle for its GPU products. AMD is looking at a massive free cash flow ramp AMD said in its last earnings report that it is seeing strong demand for the Instinct MI300 accelerator, and the chipmaker could be on track to see a serious ramp in free cash flow in the next several years. Its guidance for Data Center GPU revenue is more than $4.0B for FY 2024 and I would not be surprised to see a doubling of GPU-related revenues next year given how strong the demand for these products is right now. AMD only saw 2% revenue growth, year over year, in the last quarter, while Nvidia crushed it with a 262% Y/Y increase. However, as AMD accelerated its Instinct MI300 shipments in Q2'24, AMD could be set to see much stronger revenue and free cash flow tailwinds than in the last quarter. This doesn't mean that AMD will overtake Nvidia in the data center GPU market in the near term, but AMD's free cash flow growth potential may be potentially underrated here. AMD generated just $379M in free cash flow in the last quarter, which calculates to a FCF margin of 7% while Nvidia crushed it with $14.9B in FCF and a margin of 57%. Nevertheless, AMD's free cash flow margin has improved from 4% in Q4 '23 to Q1 '24, in part due to the shipments of high-margin Instinct MI300 processors. With GPU-related revenues potentially doubling next year to $8.0B (my personal estimate given the enormous supply demand imbalance in the GPU market), AMD is set to see a significant improvement in its free cash flow as well. AMD's consensus top-line forecast for next year implies 28% year-over-year growth and $33B in revenues. An increase in the free cash flow margin to a moderate ~15%, which is not an aggressive assumption considering the strength of demand for Data Center GPUs, could therefore imply a total free cash flow potential of close to $5.0B in FY 2025. This expansion in free cash flow margins could mainly be driven by ramping up volume shipments of the Instinct MI300 chip (plus launch of the mentioned new CPUs) as well as pricing strength for Data Center GPUs. As AMD only achieved about $1.1B in free cash flow in FY 2023, the chipmaker could be on track to 4X its free cash flow by the end of FY 2025. This implied growth in AMD's free cash flow may be underrated, in my opinion, as the market is mainly focused on the leading top-line growth rates and FCF margins of Nvidia.

AMD√¢¬Ä¬ôs valuation I like AMD chiefly because of its underdog status and its lower valuation relative to Nvidia. AMD is actually expected to grow its EPS faster than Nvidia over the long term, chiefly in my opinion because AMD's GPU development pipeline has been trailing behind Nvidia. AMD, therefore, has considerable ""catch-up"" and revaluation potential. The same is true for Intel (INTC), which only recently launched its own AI chips, the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, for the enterprise market. In the case of Intel, I believe the market is much too bearish, which is reflected in the company's low P/E ratio. Currently, shares of AMD are valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.5X, which Nvidia surpasses with an earnings multiplier of 35.6X. Intel is by far the cheapest chipmaker with a P/E ratio of 15.8X, but Intel has had its own problems, including delayed processor launches. Nvidia did grow its Data Center and consolidated revenues a lot faster than AMD and Intel in recent quarters, but AMD is catching up here and has a very attractive risk setup given the Instinct MI accelerator pipeline. I believe AMD could trade at Nvidia's P/E of 35-36X if the company executes well with its Instinct chip releases, demand for GPUs remain high and AMD sees a significant free cash flow margin catalyst tied to its accelerating Instinct accelerator pipeline. A 35-36X P/E ratio for AMD implies a fair value range of $195-200. The aggressive product roadmap regarding GPU releases and associated FCF catalyst is why I am upgrading shares of AMD to buy. Data by YCharts Risks with AMD AMD is trailing behind Nvidia in terms of GPU-related revenue growth and market share, but AMD does have an opportunity to narrow the gap between its fiercest competitor through the successive launches of new Instinct chips... that are coming to market at a time of escalating demand. Since AMD has still not really benefited from the ramp of Instinct MI300 accelerator sales (given that shipments only started in Q1 '24), the company is set for a serious free cash flow upswing going forward. What would change my mind about AMD is if the company were to see weakening demand for its flagship Instinct MI300 chips, and if AMD and Nvidia were to see drastically falling GPU prices. Final thoughts AMD is currently the underdog in the AI GPU market, which Nvidia easily controls and dominates. However, AMD is not sleeping at the wheel and is set to debut a number of AI-focused processors that could lead to an acceleration of the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs top line/free cash flow growth and help the chipmaker narrow the gap between itself and Nvidia. Importantly, I believe AMD has a valuation advantage over Nvidia, although the chipmaker is not growing its top line as quickly as its biggest rival in the market.  I really like AMD√¢¬Ä¬ôs underdog status in the AI market, and believe that the upcoming launch of AI-supportive processors and new GPUs of the Instinct Series could make AMD more attractive from a free cash flow point of view. With a P/E ratio of less than 30X, AMD√¢¬Ä¬ôs risk profile is heavily skewed to the upside!",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the most part, that's correct.What most people don't realize, however, is that you can choose to use your debit card as ""credit"" at checkout. That doesn't mean you borrow money to make the purchase, but it does change some aspects of the transaction. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about running a debit transaction as credit.Can you use a debit card as a credit card?If your debit card has a Visa or Mastercard logo on it, you can use it as credit. To do this, you simply choose ""credit"" on the PIN pad or in the payment options at checkout. Alternatively, if you hand your debit card to a cashier or server, you can tell them you want to pay with credit instead of debit.Then, instead of providing your PIN to authorize and complete the transaction, you'll probably be asked for your signature ‚Äî usually if the transaction is over $25.What happens if you select 'credit' for a debit transaction?If you select ""credit"" for your debit card transaction, a few unique things happen. The payment is still processed as a debit from your linked checking account, but the transaction will be different from a regular debit purchase in these ways:Processing speed: The payment can take up to three days longer to process since it goes through the Visa or Mastercard network instead of coming directly from your account.Authorization: You authorize the transaction with your signature (usually for transactions over $25) and not your PIN.Rewards: If your debit card has rewards, you might have to choose the credit/signature option to earn rewards or to earn the maximum rewards available.Cash back: Since you don't enter a PIN, you won't be able to get cash back from the merchant.Liability: Visa and Mastercard both provide zero liability, meaning you won't have to cover unauthorized credit transactions on your debit card.Merchant fees: The merchant pays higher fees ‚Äî averaging about $0.24 per transaction ‚Äî when you choose credit.In terms of security, the best option is to tap the card rather than swiping or inserting it, regardless of whether you choose credit or not. That's because the ""contactless"" tap option protects your debit card data by encrypting it.Read more: When to use your credit card over your debit cardDoes using a debit card as credit help your credit score?Using a debit card as credit does not involve borrowing money, so it doesn't impact your credit score. Additionally, information about your debit activity is not reported to any credit bureaus, whether you use the account as credit or not.Your debit card activity can, however, impact your ChexSystems report. ChexSystem reports contain information about your banking history, including details such as whether your bank accounts have been closed for non-sufficient funds. You can pull your ChexSystems report for free once a year at ChexSystems.com.Read more: Can overdrafting affect your credit score?Credit-building debit cardsThere are a few new debit cards that act like hybrids between debt and credit. These cards have a credit-card-like feature that lets you ""borrow"" money to cover certain transactions, and then withdraw the funds from your bank account to pay the debt right away. Then the account activity is reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus, which can help you build up your credit score.Pros and cons of running a debit card as creditShould I use my debit card as credit?Whether or not you use debit cards as credit is a matter of preference. If you want to delay the transaction from processing or you want to earn rewards on a rewards debit card, credit is the best choice. You can also limit your liability by choosing the credit option.If you want your checking account balance to reflect recent transactions right away, regular debit transactions are the way to go.Additionally, retailers have to pay fees to Visa or Mastercard when you use the credit option, and payment processing fees are often among their highest costs. On top of that, vendors aren't allowed to inform you of the fees or pass the cost onto you, at least not directly. But you might end up paying extra for those credit fees in the form of inflated pricing.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

The names are a who's who of market leaders with only one exception ‚Äî Nvidia stock (NVDA) was down after receiving a downgrade from New Street Research.Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Costco (COST), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Walmart (WMT), on the other hand, all saw their stocks trade at intraday records on Friday.Investors can maybe point to the soft jobs report and the prospect of lower interest rates as a catalyst for the move. At least for a chunk of these winners.Tech was the biggest winner of low-interest-rate environments over the last decade, and the so-called hyperscalers in the AI race ‚Äî Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet among them ‚Äî are set to be the arms dealers should another speculative investment boom break out.But on Wall Street, it appears that spending too much time in this market teasing out the fundamental particularities of why the same group of market leaders continues to lead the market is no longer a worthwhile exercise.To wit: Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz on Wednesday dropped coverage of the S&P 500, writing that, ""Talking about the S&P 500 to communicate investment insights to institutional investors has become an exercise in futility.""The 10 biggest stocks in the index account for almost 40% of the index's market cap, Kantrowitz noted. And both the index's returns and earnings growth are being driven by this small handful of companies.Rather than reflecting a broad swath of the corporate world's fortunes, then, the so-called benchmark stock index has become captive to the AI trade. For some, this is not a flaw of the index, but a feature, as argued by strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute last week.Sure, the S&P 500 may seem to tip out of balance, reflecting the fortunes of a privileged few over the more measured progress (or struggles) of the quieter majority. But the concept of an index is that investors can capture the market return in whatever form that takes.This dynamic often benefits the DIY investor class looking for cheap exposure to ""the market,"" but it is a thorn in the side of portfolio managers who charge institutions more for their services as they seek to best the returns available to the masses.Said another way, what institutional investors seek are returns ‚Äî preferably returns that beat the market, of course ‚Äî but most importantly, returns that do not come in whatever form the market takes. For big-money investors, safety is often paramount. And AI hype minting new multi-trillion dollar winners each week doesn't exactly scream safe by this measure.Story continuesBack in 2020, before the pandemic turned markets upside down, we talked to Tom Lee at Fundstrat who saw the rally in Tesla (TSLA) stock that year as a sign of investors chasing their benchmark. Tesla stock, at the time, was responsible for a large chunk of the gains in the Russell 1000 Growth index (VONG), an index favored as the benchmark by many of Fundstrat's clients at the time.In an effort to make up this gap, clients had a simple card to play: buy Tesla.Friday's market action ‚Äî and much of what has been seen in stocks since May ‚Äî seems reminiscent.Because if the benchmark index is no longer a useful benchmark, a portfolio manager has a (seemingly) simple choice to make: either buy more of the stocks leading your benchmark, or find another way to explain your performance.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock pricesRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceView comments",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
oA1qJTB1x4mctMR,Seeking Alpha,bing,Actinium Pharmaceuticals: Oversold Despite No Bad News,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702624-actinium-pharmaceuticals-oversold-despite-no-bad-news,2024-07-05 14:43,2024-07-05 14:52,ARM,,"Anastasiia Shavshyna/E+ via Getty Images Topline Summary and Update Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE:ATNM) is a biotech company focused on developed radiolabeled biologics to help treat patients with different forms of blood cancer. They have been on a straight-lined path to approval for their radiobiologic Iomab-B for over a year now, and today I want to provide an update after their most recent quarterly filing and EHA presentation, with a focus on the investment thesis as the company has maintained a holding pattern over the regulatory landing strip. Pipeline Updates Iomab-B At EHA 2024, the company updated findings from SIERRA, in particular highlighting the improvement in overall survival among patients with TP53-mutated AML who received Iomab-B followed by a bone marrow transplant compared with those who received no Iomab-B. The medians were 5.49 and 1.66 months, respectively. Granted, this is a relatively small patient population, with only 24% of those enrolled in the study having a TP53 mutation, but this is a molecular aberration that is associated with poor outcomes. The long-term update also highlights the favorable chance of proceeding to a bone marrow transplant, since all patients who received Iomab-B were able to get one, compared with just 18% of those in the control arm. In all, these findings continue to support the potential approval of Iomab-B for patients with relapsed/refractory AML, which has been an ongoing conversation with the FDA, per their latest quarterly filing. ATNM anticipates that approval for Iomab-B is attainable by 2025, although of course no filing has yet been submitted, and this will likely represent an important catalyst as it sets a timeline for an approval decision. Actimab-A Not for nothing, ATNM isn't resting on the development of Iomab-B alone. They're also working on another AML-focused agent, the CD33 antibody-radiolabel conjugate Actimab-A. This is currently being assessed in early-stage clinical trials for relapsed/refractory disease, either in combination with multiagent chemotherapy or venetoclax. The most recent news surrounding Actimab-A was the presentation of preclinical evidence supporting the combination of this agent and inhibitors of menin as synergistic anti-AML approaches, further expanding the potential backbone of Actimab-A in R/R-AML. On the clinical front, an SNMMI Annual Meeting presentation of phase 1 trial data of Actimab-A plus CLAG-M showed preliminary evidence of activity and tolerability for the combination, with an overall response rate of 65% among the 23 patients treated to date. Financial Overview As of the most recent quarterly filing, ATNM held $84 million in cash and equivalents, with long-term deferred revenue from their collaboration agreement of $35 million yet to be received. Their operating expenses for the quarter reached $9.6 million, and after almost $1 million in interest income, the net loss recognized by ATNM was $8.7 million. Given this cash burn rate, the company has an implied cash runway of approximately 9 to 10 quarters, not considering potential milestone payments. Strengths and Risks Strength - A strong chance at approval with positive late-stage data, no change there The findings from SIERRA have been relatively unequivocal in showing that Iomab-B adds something valuable to the AML standard of care, helping to take more patients to transplant, and even helping to overcome adverse molecular features. Provided they don't have any major manufacturing issues or unresolved clinical questions, I feel that approval is a strong likelihood for the agent once they do finally get the submission completed. Strength - Cash position still strong enough to get Iomab-B to approval As of right now, there is still sufficient cash runway to get a filing ready and seen through the FDA, assuming relatively normal timelines and no other significant delays or setbacks with regulators. Radiopharmaceuticals definitely have extra manufacturing concerns that must be addressed, so the risk of a delay due to questions from the FDA is quite real, in my mind, but if things go well, ATNM currently has enough cash on hand to make it to the market, or at least to make it to a catalyst that puts them in a position of strength to raise funds. Risk - No BLA yet means uncertainty about approval and timelines ATNM has remained relatively quiet on guidance as to when we can expect to see an approval, relegating updates to SEC filings suggesting optimism for a 2025 date. I think this is a completely reasonable timeline for approval, particularly if the BLA submission can be completed before the end of this year. However, the market does not tend to like uncertainty, and this quiet period has not been kind to the valuation of ATNM, which has drifted downward throughout the last quarter despite positive data updates and what, I feel, is a strong likelihood of eventual approval. Delays mean sideways trading at best, and we don't know when that pattern will change. Bottom Line Summary ATNM being in something like a holding pattern as they continue to work toward a BLA submission creates an interesting opportunity for those still looking to find promising biotechs. At a market capitalization of just over $200 million, it would seem as though investors are not valuing this company as a promising late-stage entity on the cusp of an approval, which is what I truly think it is.  Given the data updates we've seen for Iomab-B, a promising future for Actimab-A and the march toward a first approval (which is obviously not a guarantee but looks like a strong chance to me), I continue to feel that ATNM is very much worthy of consideration in your portfolio. There's a chance that they continue their selloff until the filing of their BLA, but these prices are definitely a bargain if and when they attain approval for Iomab-B.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

But whether it makes a real impact or not is beside the point because stock splits normally create buzz around a stock.One stock that might be feeling left out these days is Meta Platforms (META 5.12%), formerly known as Facebook, which hasn't done a split yet. But the social media company has seen its share price rise significantly since 2023 and is now trading at more than $500 per share. Is a split likely coming this year?Meta is no stranger to jumping on the hypeWhether it's copying new features from its rivals, getting in on the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) by launching its own assistant, or trying to create its own cryptocurrency, Meta often likes to join the crowd. Deploying a stock split would appear to be par for the course, should the company decide to follow suit on that as well.After all, it's also the only company in the ""Magnificent Seven"" that hasn't yet done a stock split. Microsoft hasn't done one recently, but it has deployed multiple splits in its history.Now that Meta's price is around $500, it's at a high enough price for a split to be feasible, with the shares still trading at a fairly reasonable price afterward. Here are a few scenarios that could be likely:Split RatioStock Price After Split2 for 1$2503 for 1$1674 for 1$1255 for 1$1006 for 1$837 for 1$718 for 1$639 for 1$5610 for 1$50Calculations by author.If Meta were to deploy a stock split, I would assume it wants to keep its price above at least $100. That has generally been around the target area for other tech stocks after a split. Chipmaker Nvidia recently did a 10-for-1 split, and its stock is trading for around $120.There's definitely room for Meta to do a stock split and remain above the $100 mark. I wouldn't be surprised if the company were to announce one this year, especially if the stock continues to rally.Investors should have bigger concerns than whether Meta does a stock splitFor investors, what should ultimately matter is the outlook for the business in the long run, not whether the company is likely to announce a split. While its fundamentals are strong, with Meta reporting an impressive $45.8 billion in profit over the trailing 12 months, the company could face some challenges. Its growth rate has improved in the past year, but it wasn't all that long ago that the business looked to be in trouble and struggling to grow. I believe crackdowns on TikTok and Elon Musk's transformation of X, formerly Twitter, have played a role in the improvement. I don't believe Meta has suddenly found a button to turn on its growth and fix all of its problems.It's still also largely dependent on demand in the ad market, and that could soften if the economy goes into a recession. Meanwhile, as it continues to spend heavily on AI along with the metaverse and its Reality Labs division, its profit margin could also come back down.META growth rate and profit margin; data by YCharts. YOY: year over year.Investors should tread carefully with Meta Platforms stockA stock split could give Meta's shares a boost, but it's not something investors will likely be able to rely on for continued gains. There's still plenty of risk and uncertainty surrounding the business: namely, whether its growth rate is truly sustainable in the long run.Investors have seen how quickly the markets can turn on Meta when it isn't performing, after it fell by more than 60% in 2022.

A full transcript follows the video.This video was recorded on June 27, 2024.Ricky Mulvey: A pet retailer got 60% more valuable over just the last month. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey, joined today by Tim Beyers. Tim, how are we doing?Tim Beyers: Fully caffeinated, ready to go.Ricky Mulvey: We got some stories that you are ready to go on. One of them is a fully caffeinated pet retailer in Chewy. It's up by about two-thirds since literally May. Tim, I am seeing no news on this. I am holding on to my Chewy stock and I'm wondering what the heck is going on. Did everyone just get bullish on vet care clinics or the international expansion, what is going on with Chewy right now?Tim Beyers: Well, it's probably a short squeeze and we'll define what that means. But let's talk about what happened when there was an impressive earnings report in May. I'm going to make sure I have my facts straight here. I want to give you this to you, Ricky, the exact date. It was May 29th, 2024. The average volume of trading in Chewy stock was under 10 million shares on a given day. On May 29th, it was 66.6 million. Ricky, that is outrageous and some of that has to do with an extraordinary amount of buying. This is what happens when you see institutions, funds pour a bunch of money into a stock at one time. A lot of that initial surge was due to just money flooding into the stock on good news from the earnings report. Since then, the short interest in Chewy has drawn down dramatically. But you may want to talk about what a short squeeze means here.Ricky Mulvey: Let's do it.Tim Beyers: Well, then the idea here is there was a fair amount of short interest. It was over 5% of the shares outstanding. It's closer to 5.5, now it's down to 4.5. The net effect of what happened here is you'd almost think of it as the tide coming out a little bit. Lots of institutions had said, you know what? I believe that this stock is going to fall and so they'd taken short positions. They had borrowed stock on the belief that it would go down so that when they want to close their position, they buy it back at a lower price and they take the difference. They take the profit that they've earned. That's short-selling in a nutshell. What ends up happening is Chewy reports an extraordinarily good quarter and a big fat planned share buyback also good for existing shareholders and that leads institutions to say, oh, hang on, this stock is not going to go down. These were better results than we thought they were going to be. What ends up happening is they close those positions. Remember, they borrowed the shares if they want to close the position, they got to buy it back. Then you get a flood of buying all at one time, and everybody is racing to exit the position. That is the squeeze. That's what leads to, on a given day, a stock that trades for much lower volume suddenly is trading for over 6 times the volume. The prevailing wisdom on where Chewy is has changed. The winds are blowing a little friendlier.Ricky Mulvey: What should investors do during a short squeeze? As you said, there's a lot of forced buying. Sometimes if you have someone that has to buy the thing that you own, you can get a pretty good price for it because they have to buy it.Tim Beyers: Sure. I prefer, and I am a shareholder. I prefer to, when everything is going bonkers around you, I prefer to let the bonkers people go bonkers, while I can sit and drink my coffee and let those people do their bonkers things, while I just sip and enjoy. I think nothing is an underrated move, particularly when everybody is running around screaming about things happening.Ricky Mulvey: Any mindset advice, because it's not just going to happen with Chewy. We saw it. We've seen it with a lot of stocks this year, where they're just whipping upward or downward, even in the past few years, what's become what I would describe as a more violent market. Like, how does a rule-breaking investor handle this?Tim Beyers: It's a great question because you will see these movements and especially if you're a newer investor and you're not used to this, you might feel like the market is telling you something. This is where from a mindset perspective, you have to get used to this idea, Ricky, that violent moves in the market are telling you something important. Here's the Judo throw in your mind. What if this is not even remotely important? That is the question you have to start asking if you're going to get used to this, because I will tell you, there's many times where a violent move in the market is not even remotely important, and it's driven by just cash suddenly moving into a stock for reasons that are technical or are driven by something like a short squeeze or an error or a weird news report, it's very often that these violent swings are telling you absolutely zero. If you can judo throw these violent swings and say, you know what? This is probably nothing and then 48 hours later, you can come back to it, look and see what's happening, look and see if there's anything actually material happening, and you'll know if it's material if a company has filed what's called an 8K. They've come out with something, said, like, hey, you know what? We had to sharply reduce guidance because something in our business is compromised. But in lieu of that, it's probably nothing. I'm going to channel my inner Steven Seagal during martial arts demonstrations.Ricky Mulvey: Yes. Let's move to Amazon. There's a couple stories out about Amazon. One of which is that Amazon is planning to launch a service focused on cheap clothing and household goods. This is reported by The Information, essentially selling directly from warehouses in China. This seems to be in direct response to pressure from Temu and Shein. What do you think of this?Tim Beyers: This feels like sound and fury signifying nothing. It feels like just the thing that it's a checkbox move. Ricky, I call these things a checkbox move. Amazon feels like it has to do this. It feels like it has to offer the option. Is it value-generating or value-accretive for Amazon? As an investor, that's what I want to know. Is it value accretive such that Amazon is a more valuable company by virtue of this deal? My argument would be probably not. If it is, then I'm not going to find out about that probably for at least six months. I am not buying that this is significant.Ricky Mulvey: Well, we'll see. I think there may be some risk, especially if they're showing these mark-up storefronts of facial, massaging tools, mugs, phone cases, and the companies that they're trying to compete with have quality issues. Often with the things they send. I think to your point is, there is a case this could be value-destructive to the retail business of Amazon.Tim Beyers: No question, here's something, are you angering existing partners who are using your platform to sell their goods by you introducing a Chinese competitor who's selling for half the price, but with a lower quality product? That is a potential danger here, but more importantly, what if you are importing product that has safety concerns? Does that have any legal liability attached to it? I think you're right that the odds of this being more value-destructive than it is value-creating are greater. To me, it's probably a net even. There's nothing really happening here. Again, sound and fury signifying nothing, but I think the odds of it being more value-destroying are greater.Ricky Mulvey: Speaking of value accretive, yesterday, Amazon joined the $2 trillion club. It's up there with a lot of those big tech giants. You know who they are, Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft. Any reflections on this milestone of now Amazon having a couple trillion dollars under its market cap belt?Tim Beyers: I'm going to use the David Gardner test here. This is something that he introduced with the market cap game show, where we would guess the market caps of different companies, and I am notoriously bad at that game as frequent listeners of the RBI podcast will testify to. But here's the thing: the indicator that David would often use is, if the guess was too high for the market cap, that's a signal. I have to tell you, Ricky, I'm surprised that Amazon wasn't already in the $2 trillion club. That's my reflection. I thought it was already there. I'm surprised that it wasn't there. I feel like I should have known that it wasn't there, but I don't pay that much close attention to market caps, so I'm surprised that it wasn't already bigger, which says something about the market power of Amazon.Ricky Mulvey: Well, you probably know the retail side. I'm not talking to you, Tim, I'm talking to you, the listener. You're very familiar with the retail side, you may be less familiar or have less interaction with Amazon Web Services, the Cloud Division. How important is this part of the business to Amazon being a multi-trillion dollar company now?Tim Beyers: Gave you some numbers. This is over the trailing 12 months, 94.4 billion in revenue for Amazon Web Services. Let's call that under 20% of the business. I think in the latest quarter, it was 17% of the business, over the same period, 28.9 billion in operating profit. That is 61% of Amazon's operating profit over that same period. It is vitally important to this business. I'd almost argue that it is the business. Here's a way to think about the value of AWS. Let's say, because AWS's earnings before interest and taxes, which is a rough approximation of operating profit. Over the last five years, on an average basis has grown over 25% annualized, so let's say we applied a 25X multiple to those operating profits. That's roughly a $750 billion company on one unit; that's one unit, just AWS. Another way to think about it is, if AWS is responsible for 61% of operating profit, should it be responsible for 61% or over half of the market cap? In other words, should it be valued at at least a trillion or maybe 1.2 trillion? I would argue, Ricky, that the majority of value in Amazon today is due to AWS. It is the economic driver. I know this is a retail business but in terms of what allows Amazon to take things that are its expenses, its infrastructure. That's its expenses to serve that e-commerce business and turn it into operating profit. That's the business; that's the genius of Amazon.Ricky Mulvey: Then looking ahead, you have AWS in the AI plan, which for Amazon is basically having the AI models run on Amazon Web Services. Companies pay for that, creating some business-focused products, they got a chatbot. They can do some coding, copywriting, co-piloting for you. It's called Q, it's also puts billions of dollars in anthropic, which makes the foundation models for large language models and also making some AI chips. It's also a fabulous semiconductor company. I think NVIDIA does that too. You think Amazon's in a good place for the AI gold rush being in that picks and shovels area.Tim Beyers: What you're telling me is that Amazon is buzzword-compliant. Is this what you're saying here?Ricky Mulvey: Is it more than buzzword? Is it doing real stuff or is it buzzword-compliant?Tim Beyers: It is buzzword-compliant. It's doing real stuff as well. I think, really, what's going on here is that Amazon is building out some tools to make itself more efficient. I don't think we're going to look to AWS as a provider of the world's great AI tools. However, I do think Amazon is going to be a massive and important consumer of AI for improving its underlying operations.I also think that includes silicon that helps it run AI-intensive workloads really fast and really efficiently. It doesn't surprise me that they're going to build their own AI chips, and some of their own software. They've been building their own chips and servers for years so that isn't really news. I love that they're trying to get a bit of AI buzzword boost in their stock price here, but this doesn't feel very new. But you know what? I am going to suspend my disbelief and try to give Q a try. Maybe there's something there.Ricky Mulvey: He's caffeinated and level-headed. Tim Beyers, thanks for your time and your insight. Appreciate you being here.Tim Beyers: Thanks, Ricky.Ricky Mulvey: Today's show is sponsored by public.com. That's where you can earn a 5.1% APY with a high-yield cash account.

US Members only.Up next, William Cohan, a financial journalist and a founding partner of Puck, joins me to discuss what's going on at Paramount Global, now that the most viable offer to buy it out is off the table. Bill's been writing about the saga in his newsletter, Dry Powder. Paramount is in a mess. Over the past few months, a trio of executives has replaced its singular CEO Bob Bakish. Four board members have announced that they are leaving the company, and at the same time, its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, has been allegedly trying to sell the company. The deal that seemed most likely to go through was an offer with Skydance Media, which produced and financed movies like Top Gun: Maverick, last year's Transformers movie. It's run by David Ellison, which is Larry Ellison's son. It seemed like the pieces were in place for this deal to go through, and then it was just taken off the table by Redstone. I guess a fundamental question, Bill, does Shari Redstone want to sell paramount?William Cohan: I think that she does. She's torn too because, on the one hand, I think she likes going to the Allen and Company conference. She likes being able to say that she owns CBS and owns Paramount Studio, and owns MTV or Comedy Central. I think she likes all of that, but I think she's also clinical about it. She understands that Paramount is a bit player at this point in the whole big media ball game, and that she also probably understands on some level that she has squandered the family fortune, and that if there's any hope to provide for her and her children and the beneficiaries of the family trust that she's going to have to monetize this 77% voting stake in Paramount Global. As I say, I think to some extent, she likes being able to say she owns these assets, but on the other hand she knows that she's not been the greatest steward of them and that she's going to have to sell it to monetize.Ricky Mulvey: It seems a common theme of the Paramount story is the company not selling assets when there have been deals on the table, which now previously seem like good deals. The one from Skydance was a little bit complicated, but it got to a place where essentially, Redstone would sell the controlling company, National Amusements, for a couple billion in cash, and the non-voting shares, which was one of the big arguments, would be bought at a premium. Skydance was also going to inject a billion-and-a-half into Paramount's balance sheet, which has a lot of debt on it, bleeding the company, if you will. It seems like there was negotiation on both sides. It got to a place that seemed viable. What killed the deal?William Cohan: I agree with you completely. It was a creative, but complicated deal. I thought it was clever. They were going to bring in new management. They had a new business plan. They were going to inject some excitement and enthusiasm into the company, which has been badly needing something like that. What killed it? First of all, the killing of it happened literally at the 11th hour. In fact, the special committee of the board thought they were meeting to approve the deal, and then the call came from Shari saying that she was killing it, which she can do, of course, unilaterally, without explanation. I don't think she necessarily has explained it. What I've been able to glean from my reporting is that there were a number of things. I think as we were talking about before she and David Ellison has stopped talking in the last few weeks before this which is never a good sign. I think she was a little peeved that through the course of the transaction, the special committee, which was formed to represent the interests of the non-voting shareholders to sweeten the deal for them, which basically had nothing in it, to begin with. The consideration was coming out of Shari's hide. I don't think she liked that because obviously to begin with, she probably feels like she's not getting what she hoped she would get for her stake. Certainly, it's a lot less than the family's fortune used to be, so she didn't like that. I think she was also concerned and rightly so about shareholder lawsuits and wanted there to be some vote, even a non-binding vote to hopefully ratify the deal with David Ellison. Ellison and RedBird Capital didn't want to do that, which I also understand. She also wanted them to provide some indemnity to her for these lawsuits that were going to be inevitable because she was going to get so much more consideration than the rest of the shareholders. That was more than likely to lead to shareholder lawsuits, and I can understand they wouldn't want to do that, either. I think it just seemed surprisingly doomed by that point in the transaction. What it started out fairly promising, although complicated, and the special committee did a lot of negotiating to get more out of David Ellison and RedBird than they had offered originally. There was a separate negotiation going on with Shari and NAI that the special committee wasn't really privy to involving the NAI acquisition, and so it blindsided everybody at that last moment there when the special committee thought they were about to approve the deal.Ricky Mulvey: Skydance and Paramount, they work on producing movies together, Top Gun: Maverick mentioned earlier. I would imagine that there's some tension now between David Ellison and Shari Redstone. What does this mean for Paramount's movie business moving forward if these two may not be working together on this deal? Do they go back to business as usual?William Cohan: Look, I think that there's definitely a difference, generally speaking, between deal heat and deal dynamics, and just day-to-day business dealings. It's probably too early to tell if this is going to damage the relationship between Skydance and Paramount. I suspect it won't. I think everybody is smart enough to figure that out, and I doubt Shari is involved in green-lighting movies at Paramount. I think there has been some fallout already from Paramount's predicament generally. As you mentioned at the top, the firing of Bob Bakish, the bringing on of the three co-CEOs, the board members leaving. There's been the fact that the company was for sale for six months, and then nothing happens, and the company is struggling financially as well and has a lot of debt. I think a lot of talent has left. I think this failed M&A process or this part of the failed M&A process, I don't think it's quite over yet. There are still other potential parties who might be able to pull something off. But I think this has really hurt morale throughout the companies. On Tuesday, there was a town hall, and from what I'm told where the three co-CEOs announced that they had hired bankers to sell assets. There were going to be more cuts. My sense from talking to people who attended, employees, was that morale is not great, and people are scared and still wondering what the heck is going to happen here. A failed M&A process is definitely not good for the rank and file at a company and the morale of the company and people's spirits. I don't know whether these three guys who on Wall Street are referred to as the Pep Boys, Manny, Moe, and Jack can pull this off and make people feel better about being at Paramount Global. But that's a big part of the job they have in front of them, especially if the company doesn't get sold.Ricky Mulvey: It's tough to make people feel better when you're also explaining how you're going to cut a lot of jobs. In the meantime, where can Paramount go from here? There's a potential deal from Sony and Apollo. It seems to be unable over the next few years to continue with just business as usual as it's losing a lot of money.William Cohan: Yes, the streaming, Paramount Plus, is losing a lot of money. About a billion and seven last year. The linear TV business is still making a lot of money, but it's less revenue, less profit than it used to be. They're parts of the company that have been for sale and probably are struggling as well, whether that's BET or Showtime. This is an unfortunate situation for a company and its employees, and it's a company with a very proud and long history too. CBS used to be known as the Tiffany Network. This is a company with a very proud and important journalistic history, and now we're down to 60 Minutes, Face the Nation, and CBS Sunday Morning, as far as that's concerned. That's just not a place you want to be. Furthermore, as we also alluded to, it's really amino in this world of huge white sharks at the moment that are much bigger, much better capitalized, have many more resources than Paramount Global. I think it's inevitable that Shari is going to have to sell this thing, she has to. I don't know any other way for her to get out of it and get liquidity for her and her family. I thought that that was what was going to happen here. It looked like that's what was going to happen, at the 11th hour, she pulls the football away, so that's a big bummer. There's been leaks about Edgar Bronfman. Obviously, Sony and Apollo is around. This is exactly the deal dynamic that Sony have that Apollo loves and is put on this Earth to exploit, so I would not count Sony and Apollo out, although there are major league regulatory issues regarding their potentially owning these assets. Obviously, Shari's not going to make nearly as much money by selling to Sony and Apollo because they're not even going to buy NAI, their offer would be for Paramount Global itself, so she would get the same as everybody else, which is good news on the shareholder lawsuit front, but is going to mean a lot less money for her. She must have known that unless she thinks that Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Bain Capital are somehow going to pay her $2.5 billion for NAI, which I absolutely don't get because I don't see how somebody just steps into her shoes without having a plan.At least David Ellison and Gerry Cardinale at RedBird Capital had a plan, and it was clever, and it was creative, and it was interesting, and it was exciting. Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Bain Capital, just buying NAI and becoming the new Shari Redstone and keeping Manny, Moe, and Jack in place. I don't get it. I don't understand how you can get a return if you're Bain Capital putting up all that money, so I don't really see that, frankly. I think that's just a way to let Sony and Apollo know that there might be other bidders. I think that's a big-head fake, but we'll have to wait and see. The deal dynamics are very good for Apollo. I'd expect them to take advantage of this at some point soon. I think the special committee is still impaneled and can still act on behalf of shareholders. But it's going to be up to Shari, and once again, she and her unilateral right can just nicks it if she wants to or green light it if she wants to. Maybe we'll have to wait until after the Allen and Company conference when she's made the rounds, and everybody can see her hobnobbing with the rest of the big shots from Hollywood, maybe she'll feel a little bit better about things. Maybe something will come out of there, because occasionally, things do spring out of the Allen and Company conference, not lately, but in the past, so maybe she'll be feeling better about herself and her status in Hollywood, and we'll go forward with the deal that she should have done long ago, to be honest.Ricky Mulvey: Seems like a tough story for investors to play arbitrage games with.William Cohan: The abs got burned when she pulled the plug on the Ellison deal.Ricky Mulvey: Bill, I really appreciate the work that you and Matt Belony have done on this story in particular. Thanks for joining us again on Motley Fool Money.William Cohan: Sure. Thank you, Ricky. Appreciate it.Ricky Mulvey: I'll throw a link to Puck's newsletters in the show notes. They are excellent.

mEJoMO5lGyz62iS,Yahoo Finance,bing,HBC should apply learnings from new Saks Global company to the Bay: experts,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hbc-apply-learnings-saks-global-162309895.html,2024-07-05 15:18,2024-07-05 15:20,AMZN,,"TORONTO ‚Äî When Liza Amlani visited Hudson's Bay Co.'s flagship Toronto store last week, she was quickly taken aback by the scene.""I did a walk-through just to see what was going on and crickets,"" the co-founder of the Retail Strategy Group said Friday.""There were no people. There was excessive markdowns, rails and rails of product, which tells me that either the buying team (or) the planning team does not know what the Canadian customer is looking for.""Retail experts say figuring out how to appease shoppers and tackling the issues Amlani spotted are even more pressing for Canada's oldest business now that its parent company has inked a blockbuster deal that will unite several department stores.ADVERTISEMENTHudson's Bay announced Thursday that it had reached an agreement to buy rival Neiman Marcus Group, which owns 36 self-titled department stores and two Bergdorf Goodman locations.Should the deal snag all the necessary approvals, Hudson's Bay will combine its new purchases with Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off 5th, which it bought in 2013, calling the new firm Saks Global.The Bay will be left out of the entity, but its parent company said the deal will recapitalize the brand and give it more liquidity.While it makes sense not to include the brand in Saks Global, Lisa Hutcheson, a retail strategist with J.C. Williams Group, said the deal leaves the Bay ""sitting on the sidelines.""""There is a chance that it will just be less of a focus for the business, and really focusing on this merger of Saks and Neiman Marcus,"" she said.But the deal also leaves plenty of room to apply lessons from Saks to its Bay business, especially because the agreement brings two big tech names into the fold.As part of the transaction, e-commerce goliath Amazon and software giant Salesforce will become investors in Saks Global.All parties involved in the transaction have declined to share whether the companies will receive a stake in the business and Hudson's Bay did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.Story continuesHutcheson thinks the parent company should see whatever processes Amazon and Salesforce bring to Saks Global as a potential model for the Bay.""I think they'd be foolish not to take any learnings that they have,"" she said.Amlani agreed. She imagines the deal will be a way for the Bay to learn more about how it can improve its supply chain, inventory management and e-commerce.""When we look at retail today, let alone department stores, the way that they're run is in silos, it's very manual, there's a lack of trust in technology, so it takes a lot longer to connect the dots across an organization, especially one as big as a department store,"" said Amlani.""This gives me some hope that we're going to come out of those Middle Ages and we're going to get into the future ... and technology is going to help retailers do that.""Time is of the essence because many have felt Hudson's Bay has been struggling for years now.Before it went private in 2020, the company closed Home Outfitters and sold Lord & Taylor to fashion rental subscription company Le Tote Inc.Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it also closed some stores and laid off workers. By the time retailers were starting to recover, however, inflation and interest rates were soaring, weighing on consumer spending patterns.While the luxury market many of Hudson's Bay brands play in is more immune to economic swings, the glory days of the department store model are long gone.Neiman Marcus filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2020 but managed to survive.

Gox starts its payout process. The oldest cryptocurrency saw a gradual decline throughout the week, and slipped below the $60K mark on Wednesday. BTC dropped below the 200-day moving average on Thursday, as Mt. Gox displayed signs of activity for the first time in a month and the German Federal Criminal Police Office moved over $75 million to crypto exchanges, a CoinDesk report stated. The sell-off continued on Friday as Mt. Gox said it has started the payout process to its creditors.  ""The Rehabilitation Trustee made repayments in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash to some of the rehabilitation creditors through a part of the Designated Cryptocurrency Exchanges etc.,"" the firm said in a press release.  Media reports suggested the payout includes about $9 billion worth of tokens. Earlier on Friday, BTC had slipped to $53.7K, its lowest levels in four months.  ""Bitcoin price slipped under 60k showing pressure from investors looking for better yield elsewhere. We remain bullish on Bitcoin in the mid-long term and continue to pay attention to critical macro data for the rest of the month,"" said Lucy Hu, Senior Analyst, Metalpha. Hu had also attributed the German government moving more than $50 million to crypto exchanges as one of the top reasons for the drop in BTC price.  √¢¬Ä¬úThe impact of Mt. Gox on the Bitcoin price is likely exaggerated. Mt. Gox creditors have had years to sell their claims if they wanted to.

rwDwP5lRKByEeZ9,Seeking Alpha,bing,This Is Why Bitcoin Is Crashing; And Why I'm Buying More,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702629-this-is-why-bitcoin-is-crashing-and-why-im-buying-more,2024-07-05 15:18,2024-07-05 15:28,BTC,,"peshkov Thesis Summary Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has experienced a very substantial sell-off in the last couple of days and is down over 20% in the last month. Panic has hit the crypto world, and a lot of people are already talking about a bear market. However, we can actually look behind the scenes here to try and better understand why Bitcoin is selling off. Furthermore, we can use technical analysis to determine the key levels of support that we might test in the next few days. Ultimately, the fundamentals for Bitcoin have not changed. Data suggests we will see trillions flow into crypto over the next decade. √¢¬Ä¬úDie Wale√¢¬Ä¬ù Are Selling The German government has been selling the Bitcoin it seized over the last few weeks. On.chain data suggests the German government sold around $175 million in Bitcoin on July 4th. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, since the European country still holds a neat stash of around 40,000 Bitcoin. Following the initial price crash, the founder of Tron (TRON-USD), Justin Sun, offered to buy up all of Germany√¢¬Ä¬ôs Bitcoin off-chain in order to prevent further price crashes. We√¢¬Ä¬ôve also seen some German MPs voice their disagreement with the country's actions. Joana Costa said the Bitcoin sales were a hasty move, and that the government should consider holding on to the cryptocurrency in order to diversify the nation's Treasury reserves. On top of the sales from the German government, which are a verifiable fact, there√¢¬Ä¬ôs also some speculation that investors could be selling their Bitcoin received from the recent Mt.Gox settlement, or that perhaps short-sellers are pre-empting this move. Mt.Gox was one of the first large centralized crypto exchanges, and following its bankruptcy, legal procedures have taken place in order to re-pay their users to the extent possible. The trustee for the Mt.Gox bankruptcy estate said that they had begun paying out settlements in Bitcoin this Friday. That√¢¬Ä¬ôs about $9 billion worth of Bitcoin that could be entering as possible selling pressure. Fundamentally, there√¢¬Ä¬ôs been a temporary and sudden spike in selling pressure, without a commensurate increase in demand. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs certainly worth noting that this sell-off really began taking place on July 4th, a day when regular markets are closed in the US, and one would expect the crypto market to also be less liquid than usual. Technical Outlook Looking at the technicals, however, we are well within the range of a correction I would expect in Bitcoin. Bitcoin weekly chart (Trendspider) Looking at the weekly chart, I√¢¬Ä¬ôd say we are still forming an impulse from the lows back in 2023. Bitcoin topped around $70,000 in a wave 3 and has now formed a corrective ABC structure in a wave 4. As I write this, we are finding support around the 38.2% retracement, and we are also holding above the50 week MA. The RSI is approaching 50 and the last time this happened on the weekly was just ahead of the wave rally. BTC daily chart (Trendspider) Zooming in, we can see that we have completed an ABC in wave 4, with the plates moving down a pretty clean five-wave structure. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs definitely quite encouraging to see that while the price has fallen, the RSI has held quite well, giving us a bullish divergence. We did break below the 200 EMA on the daily chart, but we also saw this happen earlier in this bullish cycle. $54,000 could be the bottom, but below that our next main area of support is just around $50,000 where we have the 50% retracement. Below that, we may have to worry about the more immediate future of Bitcoin, though I would still argue it would be an attractive long-term buy. Fundamentals The fundamental landscape for Bitcoin is still very much supportive of higher prices, with three great sources of demand coming in over the next few years to push this higher-  Institutions Nations Young(er) Investors  The adoption by institutions, including funds and companies, is already well underway. Institutional AUM is over $60 trillion, and we are already seeing a change in the tide. Microstrategy (MSTR) is heavily accumulating Bitcoin, and so are other companies like Tesla (TSLA). US companies hold around $6.9 trillion in cash reserves that could potentially make their way into Bitcoin and even other cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, we may see a shift in nations too. Yes, this may still be far away, but the recent sales by Germany have brought this fact to the forefront. There are politicians within the system making the case for Bitcoin. Even Donald Trump, who could potentially be the next US president mentioned using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Global currency reserves (Statista) There's currently over $11 trillion in foreign reserves according to this data from Statista. This is yet another source of demand that could slowly make its way into Bitcoin over the next decade. We already have countries like El Salvador, which is using Bitcoin as legal tender and has accumulated large reserves. I don't expect Bitcoin to take a major role in the monetary system, at least not in the next decade, but there's certainly going to be some value to holding at least some Bitcoin. Lastly, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs also worth noting that we are going to see a huge transfer of wealth from Baby Boomers or Gen X and Millennial investors.   AUM by generation (Reddit) Up to $84 trillion will be passed down to younger investors according to Bank of America (BAC). Why does this matter? These younger investors are much more likely to put money into crypto. Investor preferences by age (BofA) Crypto and digital assets come second only to real estate in terms of investor preferences, again, according to BofA research. As these assets transition from the older generation to the younger, we can expect these younger investors to allocate a much larger percentage of their wealth towards digital assets. Final Thoughts In conclusion, I still believe this Bitcoin sell-off is a huge opportunity for investors. Technical levels are still holding on to the larger time-frames, and fundamentals still support Bitcoin√¢¬Ä¬ôs continued price appreciation thanks to those three sources of demand mentioned above. While Bitcoin's market cap is not going to increase 100-fold from these levels, I do believe there's plenty of room for it to appreciate significantly as it becomes a staple in portfolios around the globe for institutions, companies and the coming generation of retail investors. Bitcoin has gained social acceptance, and it has established itself as a valid form of investment.  Today's pullback does not represent the end of the asset's ascent, but merely a small correction in what will likely be a much larger bull market.

The study, which was published Friday on the JAMA Network Open website, showed that patients taking GLP-1 drugs or metformin showed a significantly reduced risk of developing ten cancers associated with obesity than those who took insulin. Researchers noted, however, that GLP-1s didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt appear to lower the risks any more than metformin. Statistically significant risk reductions were observed in GLP-1 users for gallbladder cancer, meningioma, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, esophageal cancer, endometrial cancer and kidney cancer.  The study was based on an analysis of the electronic healthcare records of roughly 1.7M patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed a GLP-1 drug, metformin or insulin between 2005 and 2018. The GLP-1 drugs included in the study were first-generation medications such as Novo Nordisk√¢¬Ä¬ôs (NVO) Victoza. The study also included Novo√¢¬Ä¬ôs Ozempic, which was approved by the FDA for diabetes in 2017, but not Eli Lilly√¢¬Ä¬ôs (LLY) Mounjaro, which was approved in 2022, according to Bloomberg. Ozempic and Mounjaro are also marketed for weight loss under the names Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively. Metformin, which has been on the market for years, is available in generic formulations.

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool analyst Asit Sharma. Asit, thanks for joining me.Asit Sharma: Dylan, I'm excited to be with you today.Dylan Lewis: We've got to look at two businesses up big this week, and I'm excited to dig into them. We've got FedEx and Rivian, both on the move, both in the green. We also have a check-in with a CFO on software spend and naming rights for NFL stadiums. Asit, let's kick off with the biggest of the big movers Today. Electric vehicle maker Rivian up over 25% this week. After news out that Volkswagen is going to be putting $5 billion into the business, I'm going to run through the terms of this quick, and then I want to get your take. That 5 billion is broken up into a few different pieces. Rivian is getting a $1 billion initial injection, plan to grow to a $3 billion stake from Volkswagen over time, and then a $2 billion investment in a joint venture company that will supply future vehicles for both Volkswagen and Rivian. Market clearly love the news for Rivian here. What do you see?Story continuesAsit Sharma: I think this is good for both companies. It's clearly good for Rivian, which has been burning cash on its way to gaining scale in the EV industry. That's really what you need Dylan to play in this game. You've got to sell enough vehicles that you have a positive gross margin and have positive cash flow. Right now, Rivian burns through a billion-plus bucks. I didn't look at the number too closely this morning, but guesstimating this past quarter about 1.4 billion in negative free cash flow, but it's doing that as it gets to a build volume number, which will make it profitable. It does need more capital to be injected into the business, and we saw with Elon Musk and Tesla early on a great ability for that company to raise the funds it needed to reach scale, which it finally did, so this is helpful for Rivian. I've got some thoughts on why Volkswagen would want to team up with them, but I'll pause here for some thoughts from you.Dylan Lewis: It was funny. I was listening to our shows last week and hearing your discussion on Fisker with our colleague, Mary. It was ringing in my ear as I was looking at this news. Scale and capital, Rivian seems to be getting a bit of both here. They did have about eight billion dollars in cash and short-term investments on the books, but to your point, the cash burn for this business is serious, and Rivian co-founder and CEO RJ Scaringe did note this partnership is expected to help secure our capital needs for substantial growth. We have wondered with the EV upstarts. Can they continue to move through all of the waves of this market? The interest moving in and out with consumer demand? This seems to shore them up, at least for the next few years.Asit Sharma: I think so too, Dylan. With the cash and investments that are on the balance sheet plus an injection of somewhere 4-5 billion, they're probably good to go. They're going to make it. I think that's one reason why the stock is up so much this morning. Now, what's in it for Volkswagen? That's such an interesting partner for Volkswagen because it's not a company that has reached scale, but there's been so many great choices that Rivian's management has made in building the company from the ground up, and Volkswagen calls this out. One is this software-defined vehicle architecture. This is really everything on the software side that Rivian does, like connectivity, being able to have over-the-air updates, or software updates that affect the vehicle, being able to customize vehicles, and integrating with future autonomous technologies. All of this is something that Volkswagen, as a major manufacturer, is very interested in, and it saves Volkswagen from having to solve some of the problems of keeping up their legacy approach and then transitioning to the new. There's one other thing that was called out in the press release, and this is zonal hardware design. Every manufacturer has a different approach. Tesla has its own approach to manufacturing. We talked about Fisker last week. Something that I think Rivian has excelled in is just the idea of building cars within zone. When you do this and assign a different zone for each piece of hardware, you reduce the wiring that is needed in the vehicle. You reduce complexity, the maintenance becomes easier, future support becomes easier, so this is something that Volkswagen over in Europe is looking at and studying for its future design vehicles, and the ability to have multiple types of vehicles across different platform design choices is maybe one of, not the holiest of grails, but the holy grails of this business, and Rivian has a take on this in this zonal approach. So I think when you look at those two, the amount of cars that Volkswagen will already be able to produce profitably, it's a great proposition for them. It won't happen overnight, though. It's going to take the 5-10 year range for Volkswagen to realize the advantages of this investment.Dylan Lewis: I like that you zoomed in on the software piece of that because largely the market reaction of this on the Volkswagen side was a yawn. I actually think there should be a little bit more excitement for this because software issues have plagued Volkswagen for the past few years. Their Cariad divisions issues have led to delays in launching vehicles in some cases, and so this seems like something that they need to get right. Market didn't really care much about the news, but this seems like something that Volkswagen's management is rightly focusing on to set themselves up for that next stage of growth.Asit Sharma: Of course, memory is so short. Five years from today, analysts will be talking up Volkswagen's superior software choices and how they seamlessly update their vehicles over the air, forgetting that they yawned today, but that's investing [laughs].Dylan Lewis: One thing, I did want to dig into a little bit on this. Rivian currently a 15 billion-dollar company. It may grow a bit in the time that Volkswagen ultimately builds out that full three billion dollar position, but they will become a sizable shareholder here, and we are starting to see some cozying up in general in this market. What should investors have in mind, Asit, as they see some of these partnerships, both in the joint venture space but also with Volkswagen now owning a substantial amount of equity in Rivian?Asit Sharma: It's a very good point, Dylan because some of the future investments will come in the form of further stock purchases. I think in this case, you want companies that already have a cooperative nature. This wasn't a deal that happened overnight, and we learned that they've been studying technology back and forth for several months. If you're a Rivian shareholder, you want a deep-pocketed partner, someone who's going to have four or five billion in the game. If they need to spend another billion, they're going to salvage their investments, so you want that as a Rivian investor. If you're a Volkswagen investor, you want to buy the technology, and note, some of this intellectual property that Rivian has is going to be licensed back to the joint venture. You want to get that while it's cheap when the EV industry is slowing down, when companies like Rivian is in better shape than some, but they're depressed. The multiples are depressed. This is a great time for Volkswagen to pick this up, so from the side of being that Volkswagen shareholder, this is what you want as well. I think it's good for both companies. Just in these situations, watch the amount of control that could be gained. Now, as you mentioned, Rivian doesn't have a super small market cap, this investment isn't going to be one where Volkswagen can call the shots in the future. They can have influence, but we may see some scenarios where EV makers get bailed out, and they won't be able to call their own shots anymore. That's something to look forward if we see more of these deals come down the pipe.Dylan Lewis: Also, up this week, FedEx shares up almost 15% following earnings, and they looked in a lot of ways like the earnings we were expecting from this business. The theme for this company for a while this year, Asit, has been not a lot on the top line, but we are focusing heavily on the cost structure of this business, that seemed to be a lot of the main talking points from management when they were running through the results.Asit Sharma: Yes, and I think this reflects again, scale, but of a different sort. Let's now flip the page and talk about companies that are already at scale and are growing more slowly. Let's talk about yawns again, Dylan. The market yawned last year when FedEx said, in fiscal 2023, we're going to cut 4-5 billion dollars out of our cost structure by fiscal year 2025. That's not as exciting as saying we've just found this great way to accelerate our revenue. In fact, the initiatives that FedEx has rolled out, and there are several of them, are boring. There's Network 2.0, which is consolidating FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services, all those systems into a unified system and finding some cost savings there. Really speeding up throughput, getting improved delivery speeds, etc. There's one FedEx, which is another. It's such an exciting name. [laughs] I can see you. We're watching each other resume as we record. I see you're so excited to hear that. That's like unifying the customer experience, making the branding more consistent. Then they have this overarching cost initiative called Drive, and there's an acronym for Drive. I won't bore listeners just now, but the upshot of it is, until those results start to come through, it's a yawn because so many companies do this. Here's the difference that I see. FedEx is a company that's approaching 100 billion bucks in annual revenue. I think they'll reach that in just a few years. We've seen companies at scale like Walmart and Amazon, which also sell in the hundreds of billions of dollars, really juice up profits and cash flow with just a little bit of improvement in operating margin because, when you've got 100 billion dollars in sales, you cut 1% from that total expense category. That's a substantial amount of profit that you can take and cash flow that you can generate and perhaps invest in the business, return to shareholders. Some of this, I think, is investors are warming up to what FedEx can do with this cost savings in the future, and just imagining even if it grows a little more slowly, the results could be substantial for shareholders.Dylan Lewis: I think maybe some of the excitement here and some of the reaction that we're seeing from the market is the fact that, in addition to this most recently reported quarter, we got a look at what they are expecting, and they are indicating that we are going to see a return to growth for 2025. Very welcome news because that has not really been the story in 2024. I love talking about FedEx because it is one of those bellwether companies. We can look at the individual elements of the business, but we can also take that step back and see what it says about the overall macro picture. Seeing them signal that they're expecting a better year ahead, Asit, what else do you read into the results?Asit Sharma: I read into these results, and Raj Subramaniam, the CEO of this company, mentioned some of these themes that you're bringing forward, Dylan. I'm reading into this that there is possibly like a tailwind that arises. They see the results of the cost savings. They see the return to growth, but because FedEx's stock got slammed so much, they're being conservative, and I think maybe other investors are reading this into the tea leaves that really they see an improving macro picture. They're going to outperform their estimates next year. I think there's something to be read between the lines here. They don't want to come out and say, our economists could have told us if next year is going to be so good, but that's what they're saying. They think the macro is going to get better, and when it does, that's not going to light a fire under the stock, but it's going to kindle. It's going to put some heat under the stock.Dylan Lewis: To your point, I think that management from FedEx has been careful and had been very conservative in what they've tried to signal, in part because the environment has been so hard for them to anticipate, and I think we see a lot of signs of that. You go back just to their report that came out in December of 2023. Shares were down 10% after they indicated they would wind up down year over year instead of flat. We now have the benefit of looking at their full-year numbers. They were able to eke out 1% growth, but I think they wanted to provide that signal to the market that there may be some pain ahead and be able to surprise to the upside. Asit, wouldn't be surprised to see more of that as we look out to the future, and maybe the macro environment shares up a little bit far.Asit Sharma: I agree. I think my last thought on this is they're really expressing confidence in their ability to find cost savings. It's one thing to let go of some employees to dispose of some underperforming business lines. It's quite another to really do the boring stuff we were talking about to streamline processes, to unify disparate systems, and start to spend less on stuff. So I think there's a little bit of swagger today, like, hey, we got this. We can streamline our operations, and we can deliver some more cash flow and earnings to shareholders. There's some well-deserved confidence in the tone of today's call.Dylan Lewis: You know what? I love seeing the market cheer on some of the boring stuff, Asit. It's important. We need to recognize the boring stuff and give that some love sometimes, too.Asit Sharma: Totally. Dylan, we're used to seeing the companies that are on everyone's front-of-mind companies take off on a given day, and you and I were just chatting last night at Slack, like FedEx up 15% pre-market. What? Good for them.Dylan Lewis: Good for them. Asit, thank you so much for joining me today.Asit Sharma: Thanks a lot, Dylan. This was a lot of fun.Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey with Motley Fool Money here to tell you about a vehicle that is redefining sporting luxury, the Range Rover Sport. The first thing I noticed when I sat down in the driver's seat is that I felt like I was in a cockpit. You're up off the ground in a focused interior that promotes exhilarating driver engagement. I also really appreciated the overhead 360-degree cam review that let me know exactly where I was going as I was backing out of the parking space. I went for a drive in the Range Rover Sport out in Littleton, Colorado, and tested the accelerator just a little bit and felt the performance and agility. It's an instinctive drive with engaging on-road dynamics and effortless composure. To put it plainly, the Range Rover Sport is powerful. It's also quiet and comfortable. Advanced cabin technologies, such as active noise cancellation and cabin air purification, offer new levels of comfort and refinement. The third-generation Range Rover Sport is the most desirable, advanced, and dynamically capable yet. I'd like to invite you to visit landroverusa.com to learn more about the Range Rover Sport.Dylan Lewis: Coming up, my colleague Ricky Mulvey caught up with Adam Ante, the CFO of Paycor. You may know the name as the sponsor of Paycor Stadium, home of Ricky Cincinnati Bengals. The company builds payroll and HR software, and in the combo, they take a look at where Paycor fits into the competitive landscape, how Ante is thinking about artificial intelligence spending, and the investment thesis behind naming an NFL stadium. Quick note, Ricky and Ante refer to NRR for newer listeners that's net revenue retention, and it measures company's ability to retain and grow revenue from existing customers.Ricky Mulvey: For someone listening, they probably don't know the differences between HR software. There's a lot. There's Pay.com, Paycor. Oracle has an HR offering, Workday, UKG, ADP. I think for a table setting approach, it's where Paycor fits into this landscape would be useful for them and me.Adam Ante: Well, maybe I'll just start with Paycor a little bit, and then we can talk about the market more broadly. Paycor is a modern HCM solution focused in the S&B market, and we do software solutions from talent attraction, onboarding, performance management, OKRs, and of course, payroll is at the heart of our core offering. We focus in what we call the 10 employees up to about 2,500, maybe up to 5,000 employees. That's a target company size. This is really a little bit different for software versus payroll in HCM. We like to segment the market by employee size. That's not really how companies think of themselves, companies think of themselves as a manufacturer or a global supply chain management company. But we do that because of the complexity usually if the business follows employee size for payroll and HCM. When you go across the whole competitive stack, there are dozens of companies, and it's generally based on the complexity of the market. You have companies at face or that focus on under 10 employees under 20 under 50 employees. That micro and small end of the market, you have players like Intuit. Some of the larger ones now or growing, like Gusto, but clearly paychecks has been there for a long time. But they're really focused on the small end of the market, under 50 under 20 employees. Then you have the large enterprise organizations like ADP. ADP plays across the whole stack, but they have a huge enterprise focus, Workday, Ceridian, UKG. They tend to play more up market. Then in the mid market segment, there's just a handful of us. From a native Cloud platform. You have us, and, of course, Pay.com, Paylocity, ADP plays across that stack as well. But that's why it looks like it's a more crowded space than it is, because no one has a platform that goes from the micro segment all the way up. ADP has multiple platforms to serve each of those segments, just because the complexity of payroll and labor management become increasingly harder as you grow your organization.Ricky Mulvey: In talking about the products, one of the claims I've seen is that Paycor increases retention by 10% at an organization. Can you walk through the claim and how the product does that?Adam Ante: The note is that clients who use our talent solutions see an increased retention of 10% versus those who don't. It's hard to say that it's always the talent, increases their retention, but clearly companies who are using the talent solutions have more of a focus on talent management, and it's around talent attraction. Finding the right candidate up front is clearly the most important dynamic. Finding great candidates, we have a passive candidate sourcing tool, and we found that passive candidates. If you can find those and attract them, then they're more likely to be successful and stay longer versus somebody who's actively looking in the market or who's already lost their job and looking for another role. Then we've gone really deep into both employee engagement, as well as organizational management. The performance management, the one on ones. All of that is tied together. You're probably not like this, but when I first started, 25 years ago, we would do all of our performance management in a word document. It would get saved somewhere online, and you'd never see it again, but it would be done once a year. Now you can manage your one on ones in the application, you could schedule from the application. That will roll into your organizational targets that you want to set, your goals. How are you achieving against your goals? Then your performance management is really just stemming from all of your one on ones and all of the comments that you've made against your OKRs. It's just much more integrated. The feedback is really critical that you're giving feedback in real time and as close to actionable as possible. Is clearly more important to help drive employee engagement and enable front line managers to be, more helpful for their employees and then be able to drive more engagement with employees. We actually have built a lot of our solutions with the front line manager in mind. All the way through from on boarding to, of course, there's efficiencies in payroll, but it's really around the talent management performance management, coaching, the micro learning capabilities.Ricky Mulvey: Let's talk about AI for a sec because it's in an interesting spot for your company where I think there's a difference in pressure between your investors who want to see AI-use cases and also your customers who aren't necessarily asking for it. AI is also incredibly expensive, while there's a lot more spending on it than revenue generation, especially for a company like Paycor, how are you thinking about AI spend right now?Adam Ante: I've been really excited about AI. We've been using AI for a long time, but when ChatGPT first launched, it was really exciting to see some of the potential and some of the use cases even early on. We spent a lot of time evaluating, reviewing, how can we use this? What are the opportunities? We launched some small things into the product. We've used other more machine learning based AI capabilities inside of the product like the Candidate sourcing tool, which we've been able to charge for. But I think you're right, there's a lot of AI functionality that's interesting, it's cool, it's fun, but most folks are not ready to pay for it, and the value just really isn't there yet. We see that same side from the internal side when we're evaluating products. There's a lot of co pilot capabilities. There's a lot of interesting things that look fun that just don't have the value quite yet, that folks especially from a business, enterprise value really ready to go spend significant dollars on.Ricky Mulvey: What's an unlock you'd be waiting for, where you would say, once AI can do this, I'm ready to spend a bunch of money on it here at Paycor.Adam Ante: That's interesting. I think if I start internally, things like the agent assist capability, which has been a long time in the market, but it's really getting to the next level where you can really start to see that the AI understands your product, understands the challenges of your specific customer as well, and that they could present that back either to an agent internally so that we can help the customer or to the customer directly, which I think will take a little bit more time. But I think that would really be game changing. That's going to be next level, and we see some companies are starting to see some value there. I think some of the commentary that I've heard is probably overblown in terms of folks getting that much value out of it today, but I definitely see the potential there. I think some of the co pilots continue to be interesting. But helping developers, I think is one way to get them up to speed faster. We see younger, meaning earlier in their career developers tend to engage in the co pilot capabilities faster. Then they can just get up to speed a little bit faster. But understanding the internal infrastructure and making sure that you understand where all the databases are, how the architecture of the software works, how all the products work together, AI is not quite there yet and its ability to scan the system and understand how navigate. I think that will be one of the next level unlocks. One of the thing that we're really excited about because we're working on it internally for our product, and I'd love to see more of it on the back office side and the efficiency side is leveraging an AI capability on top of other models that are more specific. We're starting to see some of this come together where you might have three, four, five, 10 different models that have a functional specific capability, and then you have an ability to chat with that capability on top of it and it can navigate and then drive workflows. I think that's maybe where it's going to go.Ricky Mulvey: I want to talk about the numbers a little bit, and then we can do some, there's more fun topics. I want to talk about when you report earnings, you split out the growth rate and revenue and the growth rate in recurring revenue. I think both of those are about 18-16% on the year, but not net revenue retention. What's the net revenue retention looking like for Paycor this year?Adam Ante: Last year, net revenue retention was just at 100%. We don't share a quarterly because it's honestly not helpful on a quarterly basis. Some of the dynamics, and just the way that it moves around. We look at it on a full year and so we'll report that at the end of June. Some of the pressures on net retention this year are going to be like the same store sales growth. That labor market growth is a part of our number, and you'll build from gross retention plus cross sale opportunities, plus any pricing changes in the portfolio, and then that labor market growth. The labor market growth has been a little pressured, of course, like we've been talking about.Ricky Mulvey: Is attrition a problem because you're also raising prices per employee month for folks using the software?Adam Ante: Attrition is not a problem. The reason why we have given price increases, which is fairly standard and typical across software, but broader industry as well, is really, as we continue to invest in the product, we release new functionality features. A lot of those AI-tech capabilities, we've released that, but along with a litany of other features and functionalities. Then we continue to invest in the service model. That's been a big part of what we've done, especially following 2020, where we had some service pinches in our organization? We've continued to invest quite a bit back into the service model. Those are the things that we look for when we do regular price increases.Ricky Mulvey: Now what I really want to talk about, which is that you have a stadium named after you. You have an NFL stadium where the Bengals play Paycor stadium. You're one of the few CFOs, who's probably been a part of the decision making process of how much money are we going to spend to name this stadium for 16 years? What's the calculation that goes into that? What's the investment thesis? It's a B to B SAS company naming an NFL stadium.Adam Ante: I was skeptical as I went into the deal thinking about how we were going to generate returns. We started to break it apart into a couple different dynamics. We thought about first, the brand side of it. There's only so many NFL stadiums. They're the largest cities and markets in the country where we don't really have a brand presence on the West Coast and very little in the Northeast, and so it was an opportunity to get into some of these markets where we might be able to extend our brand. That is hard to quantify, of course, and brand awareness takes a long time to roll through to new business. But that's one of the dynamics. Then you had this investment back into the city of Cincinnati and being a part of the story that the Bengals were going through right after we became public, was a little bit more of an associate experience side. It's not a huge value, but it's been an important part of our broader brand and our employment brand. The primary driver is really about the ticket activation and the sponsorship activation. The activation side of that is really, how are you going to use the suite that you get? How are you going to use the season tickets that you have and the engagement that you can create across other markets. We have a really strong partnership, or we're able to get a really strong partnership through the Bengals on the activation side. That's clearly around creating experiences, bringing prospects and customers through the stadium, other stadiums as well and being a part of the NFL brand. That actually has been significantly better than what we had anticipated. The brand in the NFL is really strong. It has a huge draw, and the experience that we're able to create both in Paycor Stadium, but then also going to Dallas or going to San Francisco and going to Florida and bringing our prospects and customers there to be a part of it has been incredibly successful. Better than what we had anticipated.Ricky Mulvey: How does that work? Once you name a stadium, you get like a trade ease with Jerry World, or?Adam Ante: Well, exactly. It's not once you sign it, but you have to bring it as part of your deal, so you got to negotiate that through the deal. It depends on each of the stadium and each of the vendors and each of the teams, what you're going to be able to get into. Clearly, SoFi Stadium comes at a different price tag than Paycor Stadium here in the Midwest. But we were able to get a great deal with the Bengals. I've appreciated them. They were a customer before. We had sponsorship with them before, and we found like it was a good vibe.Ricky Mulvey: I probably know the answer to this. I got to take one shot at it for a headline grab. How much of a different price tag is SoFi Stadium than Paycor Stadium?Adam Ante: Well, it's quite a bit of a difference. I believe the SoFi stadium cash was over $20 million a year. We're in the six million plus for the first year, and of course it escalates over time, but it was quite a bit more affordable for us.Ricky Mulvey: In negotiating and being a part of that decision making, what have the results been two years later? What did you learn?Adam Ante: I learned that it's really important upfront to spend the time and make sure that you bring in the right partners, you have a right understanding around the dynamics. We brought in a third party consultant who has priced a lot of these deals and negotiated deals before. I think that was really important for us to be able to take the time and make sure that we get all the dynamics right, that we have the right players at the table, that we have the right insights. Then the other side, that I think typically CFOs and maybe finance folks are a little bit more leaning into is sometimes you have to take these chances and you're making bets that are hard to quantify. Not unlike AI and where AI is right now. You're taking a bet, you're making a bet on something in the case of brand and brand extension into new markets. One of the really cool things that we've seen is that our brand awareness in these markets, like San Francisco, as an example, have gone from, under 30% to over 70%. This is part of it. It's just part of it. Those are things that it's hard to quantify. You want to put it in a model and say, like, this is the value, but sometimes you have to take a little bit of it back.Dylan Lewis: As always people on the program may own stocks mentioned, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, sold US$2.8m worth of shares at a price of US$428 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$466. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was 100% of Frank St. John's holding.In total, Lockheed Martin insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Lockheed Martin better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.06% of Lockheed Martin shares, worth about US$64m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Lockheed Martin Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Lockheed Martin shares in the last quarter. Still, the insider transactions at Lockheed Martin in the last 12 months are not very heartening. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin you should know about.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The lawsuit aims to thwart an Interior Department rule that explicitly bars oil leasing on 10.6M acres of the 23M acre reserve, while restricting future oil development in 13M acres designated as ""special areas."" Congress said the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska should be used for ""expeditious production of oil to meet the nation's energy needs,"" ConocoPhillips (COP) wrote in its lawsuit, and Congress ""plainly did not authorize BLM to promulgate sweeping regulations that thwart and prevent the production of petroleum throughout the NPR-A."" But the rule contains ""numerous new provisions that elevate resource preservation over energy production and effectively turn the petroleum reserve into a de facto wilderness area in which development is outright prohibited,"" the company said. ConocoPhillips' (COP) Alaska unit owns 1.8M acres of state and federal leases in the state, including 1M net undeveloped acres as of year-end 2023, the company said in its filing.

Moreover, these funds tend to offer exposure to multi-year trends and themes, making them ideal bets for diversifying investment portfolios.As we advance, ETFs will continue gaining popularity, with their appeal largely tied to their low-maintenance nature, minimal fees, and the ability to target a swath of stocks with a single investment.That said, here are the three best ETFs to buy, effectively aligning with a strategic, low-cost investment approach. These top ETFs have been excellent performers over the years, with robust fundamentals while offering healthy long-term upside potential. Moreover, they have had an excellent track record of offering steady returns for their investors, which adds to their attractiveness.Best ETFs to Buy: iShares US Technology ETF (IYW)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comInvesting in the iShares US Technology ETF¬†(NYSEARCA:IYW) feels like a tech enthusiast‚Äôs dream come true. IYW stock offers access to some of the elite U.S. tech companies, including heavyweights that have led the market to monumental gains. Roughly 45% of its total assets are made up of three of the biggest tech stocks in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). With these elite U.S. tech companies leading the charge, IYW stock is positioned enviably to outperform the broader market with considerable aplomb.Moreover, IYW‚Äôs appeal is bolstered further by its reasonable 0.40% expense ratio, making it a cost-effective option for tech investors. Also, IYW stock has trumped broader market gains and then some over the past decade. Its 10-year return stands at 531%, which comfortably beats the S&P 500‚Äôs 179% gain. This discrepancy can be seen across multiple time horizons, including last year where IYW stock was up 43% while the broader market was up 24%.Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ)Source: Tapati Rinchumrus / Shutterstock.comAI has been hands-down the biggest investing trend in the past year, and perhaps the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) offers investors a front-row seat to the industry‚Äôs finest. With a robust annual growth of 31% in the past year and over 120% in the past five years, AIQ stands out as a top performer among AI-focused ETFs. Its portfolio of 91 holdings and a competitive 0.68% total expense ratio make it an attractive option for those looking to pounce on the burgeoning AI and big data sectors.Moreover, with its top 10 holdings representing 36% of total assets, AIQ stock effectively mitigates risk better than most of its peers. Nvidia plays a key role in driving its stock, but its investments across the AI landscape effectively shield it from downside risk. This strategic distribution ensures that the remaining portfolio components can sustain the fund‚Äôs performance when Nvidia is in correction territory.Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (AVLV)Source: SHUN_J / ShutterstockThe Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (NYSEARCA:AVLV) offers investors an excellent opportunity to tap into high-quality, bargain large-cap U.S. stocks. By focusing on stocks trading at lower valuations and strong profit margins, the Avantis ETF aims to significantly enhance potential returns.The ETF currently manages over $3.6 billion in assets, spanning various sectors, including healthcare, technology, financial services, etc. Moreover, it has holdings in 314 companies, with investments in some of the stock market‚Äôs darlings, including Meta (NASDAQ:META),¬†JPMorgan Chase¬†(NYSE:JPM), Costco¬†(NASDAQ:COST)¬†The fund‚Äôs balanced approach, targeting undervalued profitable companies, gives it an edge. It effectively provides an investment vehicle for diversifying their portfolio with strong, stable, and growth-oriented assets. Moreover, AVLV stock yields 1.62%, with two consecutive years of payout growth.

Now the 20-story building is just 50 percent leased, according to a report by its lender from last month, collated by Morningstar Credit.It‚Äôs likely to have a buyer by the end of the year, as its lender angles to seize the property through a deed in lieu of foreclosure before $57 million in debt backed by the building matures in December, loan data shows.Moceri, co-founder of Convergint Technologies, and representatives of Thomas Roszak Architecture, which partnered with Moceri on the project, didn‚Äôt return requests for comment. An attorney for the developer‚Äôs ownership LLC also didn‚Äôt return a request for comment. The Chicago-based firm Moceri + Roszak has developed apartment buildings previously, but 145 South Wells was its debut office project.An affiliate of New York-based private equity giant Fortress Investment Group originated the 145 South Wells loan in 2021 to help the developer refinance its construction loan. Fortress loaned Moceri $55 million initially and promised to forward another $16 million to the developer to help fund leasing commissions and other costs of luring tenants. The loan‚Äôs remaining balance to be paid off was $57 million as of last month.Moceri doubled down on the project during the refinancing, as it had to chip in nearly $14 million to pay off its $71.9 million construction debt package taken out in 2018, according to loan data and public records.The construction debt was secured well before the developers could have known a health crisis would hammer commercial real estate. Before refinancing with Fortress, the developer had previously put more than $20 million of equity into the project, loan data shows, meaning it will be a $34 million loss of equity if the property is surrendered to its lender.While the loan from Fortress gave Moceri a chance to turn the property around and generate some leasing momentum, interest rate hikes beginning in 2022 presented yet another hurdle that further chipped away at the property‚Äôs value.It was appraised at $78 million while the Fortress loan was negotiated, loan data shows, but it‚Äôs likely worth less today as it continues to struggle with vacancy and seeks to collect back rent from Firmspace, which suddenly vacated its lease in November, leaving behind furniture and other personal property.Story continuesA Fortress affiliate that‚Äôs acting as the loan‚Äôs special servicer ‚Äî a role activated when a borrower falls into trouble with paying off a loan ‚Äî is the decision-maker for how to work out the troubled loan, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Fortress didn‚Äôt return a request for comment, and Wells Fargo, the loan‚Äôs master servicer, declined to comment. Fortress sold off a portion of the loan‚Äôs interest after originating the debt, to investors in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, making details of the property‚Äôs performance public.‚ÄúThe current interest rate environment, combined with the volatility in the office sector has impeded the sponsor‚Äôs ability to execute their business plan and increase occupancy,‚Äù Wells Fargo said in its June report on the loan.Of course, Moceri is far from alone, as financial distress rocks commercial real estate borrowers, especially those who used now-struggling office assets as collateral. In recent weeks, developer Jay Javors surrendered a newly built LaSalle Street office building to its lender via deed in lieu of foreclosure after running into trouble with WeWork as a tenant that allegedly wasn‚Äôt paying rent, while the coworking company was about to enter bankruptcy. (WeWork ended up retaining its lease in the LaSalle building during its bankruptcy.)Back on Wells Street, the Moceri venture has continued to pay interest on the Fortress loan, even though the property isn‚Äôt generating enough leasing revenue to afford its debt service, loan data shows. That means the landlord has been paying the costs of carrying its debt out of pocket.The property brought in only $3.5 million in revenue last year, while incurring nearly $5 million in expenses, loan data shows. Funding the property‚Äôs interest payments and operating expenses without enough revenue led to a $1.4 million loss last year for the landlord, loan data shows.Before Firmspace‚Äôs sudden exit last year, the tenant was set to lease the property‚Äôs 17th through 19th floors through 2036 and pay an annual base rent of $1.2 million, with the rate rising annually to a max of nearly $1.7 million over the course of the lease, according to court records. A Cook County judge ordered the company to pay the landlord $1.2 million in January.The property‚Äôs other tenants are Mark Anthony Brewing, an affiliate of the maker of White Claw hard seltzer that agreed to lease around 13,000 square feet in the building, and legal software company Reveal Data, which leased 25,000 square feet.Read moreFirmspace shutters Chicago co-working, leaves tenants scramblingMoceri + Roszak secures $71M construction loan for Loop office towerJavors surrenders LaSalle Street office building entangled in lawsuitsThis article originally appeared on The Real Deal.

The stock climbed thanks to impressive monthly sales data and bullish news from other companies in the semiconductor industry.TSMC reported impressive monthly sales figuresTSMC is one of the few publicly traded companies that provides monthly financial data. On June 7, the company reported $7.3 billion of May revenue. That was a 2.7% decrease from April, but it still represented 30% growth over the prior year. It was the third-highest monthly sales figure in the company's history.Image source: Getty Images.The news was welcomed by analysts, who attributed the performance to strong demand from artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The May results suggest that the company is on pace to meet its second-quarter forecasts, and it might even be ahead of schedule.TSMC is benefiting from powerful industry-wide catalystsTSMC designs and manufactures chips for other semiconductor companies. Its list of customers includes many of the largest businesses in the semi industry, including Apple, Nvidia, Intel, Broadcom, AMD, and Qualcomm.That's a comprehensive list of high-profile leaders in the microchip sector, so TSMC's performance tends to reflect industry-wide catalysts. The stock can also move higher whenever one of its major customers reports good news. Both of those factors were in play last month.The iShares Semiconductor ETF is up nearly 50% over the past 12 months. The microchip industry is notoriously cyclical. Inventory rises and falls while new generations of chips replace aging products heading for obsolescence. The industry emerged from a cyclical downturn last year, propelled by surging demand for hardware to support AI and other advanced computing.SOXX data by YChartsThe AI boom has been important for software stocks like Microsoft, but it's also delivered favorable conditions for the vendors upstream in the supply chain, like TSMC. Automation and machine learning require computing power and efficiency that aren't available from previous generations of chips, and semiconductor manufacturers are rushing to meet demand.TSMC's correlation with its biggest customers is clear. The stock's price chart illustrates shared performance compared to Apple, Nvidia, and Broadcom. Taiwan Semi's impressive monthly sales, combined with Broadcom's better-than-expected quarterly results, should keep investors excited about semiconductor demand.TSM data by YChartsThis cycle will inevitably weaken at some point, but it doesn't seem like that's happening anytime soon. AI demand is likely to stay robust for at least a few quarters to come. Even if one of TSMC's largest customers falters, there's a good chance that the company is the manufacturing partner for whichever chipmaker fills the gap.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

(NASDAQ: SDIG) (‚ÄúStronghold‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) today provided the following updates regarding its operations and financial performance:Bitcoin Mining UpdateStronghold mined 61 Bitcoin in June 2024 and generated approximately $0.1mm in energy revenue, which represents the equivalent of approximately 2 additional Bitcoin based on the average price of Bitcoin during the month. This equates to approximately 63 of Bitcoin-equivalent production in June 2024.The Company generated an estimated $4.0 million of revenue during June, a decrease of 24% compared to May 2024. The primary driver of the revenue decline in June was an approximately 0.9 EH/s lower average daily hash rate that was the result of three temporary factors: 1) voluntary curtailment due to the record June heat in Pennsylvania between June 17th through June 23rd, during which time the Company avoided importing electricity at unprofitable prices, 2) the planned outage at the Panther Creek plant that included some maintenance on electrical infrastructure to support the Bitcoin mining operations, and 3) a storm that affected the Panther Creek plant transmission line on June 27th and caused the data center to be down for four days to end the month. Panther Creek has since resumed Bitcoin mining operations, and the plant completed its planned maintenance outage. Average hash price in June was $0.055 per TH/s per day compared to $0.052 in April, due to a slight increase in Bitcoin price of 0.9%, increased transaction fees, which averaged 11.4% in June compared to 7.4% in May, and a decline in network hash rate of 1.2%.About Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc.

vfDCMFiJpFGk8g5,Seeking Alpha,bing,SCHD: This Is Why I Have Turned Bullish Here As A High-Yield Investor,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702646-schd-this-is-why-i-have-turned-bullish-here-as-a-high-yield-investor,2024-07-05 17:15,2024-07-05 17:24,COST,,"Richard Drury In March this year, I issued a rather pessimistic article on the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD), recommending investors avoid going long with this ETF. The reason was simple - the opportunity cost was just too huge relative to the other high yielding investment plays out there. In other words, by investing in SCHD, investors would have to lock in an unattractive entry yield, where even after considering the dividend growth potential, there would still be a meaningful gap between total current income streams between SCHD and some defensive high yielders. Since the dividend income profile of SCHD was not that enticing, going long here just did not make sense, especially considering that one of the key objectives of this ETF is to satisfy yield-seeking investors. For instance, SCHD is certainly not a capital growth (price appreciation) vehicle, as it does not carry high growth names that typically distribute no or very minimal dividends. Looking at the chart below, we can see that after the publication of my article, SCHD has lagged behind the S&P 500 (measured on a total return basis). This has to do with the point that SCHD does not put a huge emphasis on the truly high-flying stocks, which have no meaningful dividend policies in place, and thus they fall out of the investment selection process. YCharts However, there are now two fundamental aspects that have led me to revise the thesis and form a more bullish view of SCHD. Thesis review The first aspect is related to the enhanced attractiveness of SCHD's dividend yield, which as illustrated in the chart below has gone up by ~ 30 basis points. Yet, I would argue that the actual yield is higher than this if we shift the calculus from a TTM approach to an annualized FWD yield based on the collected distribution level in the most recent quarter. Seeking Alpha By applying this kind of approach, we arrive at an implied / FWD dividend yield of ~ 4.2%, which is already an enticing level from an absolute level perspective. If we compare this yield with the U.S. 10-year YTM levels we will no longer see any meaningful difference between these two yields. Here one could theoretically argue that it does not make sense to base the dividend estimate on the recent quarter, since over the next couple of quarters the distribution levels could sink. While it is true that the quarterly distribution levels are volatile (i.e., not growing in a linear fashion), we will not find any instance where SCHD has paid out a lower dividend in Q4 than in Q2, and it is not that often when the Q3 dividend amount comes in at a lower level than in the prior quarter. All in all, the yield component of SCHD has indeed become attractive even if we do not take into account the element of growth, which is really the key essence of this ETF. So, what investors now effectively get is an ETF which provides a decent yield from the start with a ~ 10% dividend growth potential on a go-forward basis, where the underlying cash flows are underpinned by robust and large-cap businesses. The second aspect, which renders SCHD an interesting ETF to consider, is the future trajectory of the interest rate levels. In the chart below we can observe two things: (1) the Fed Funds rate is set to go down from here and (2) the level of interest rates will still remain higher than where they were during the accommodative monetary policy phase. FOMC; St. Louis Fed This implies a couple of things for SCHD. The most important one is that I believe decreasing interest rates will inevitably impact growth names in a more favorable way than high-yielding assets (or businesses). This has to do with the duration factor that is more pronounced for companies that have a back-end loaded cash flow profile. For SCHD's investments, this is the case, as most of the investments could be deemed large-cap growth names that have strong enough growth prospects to accommodate double-digit dividend growth. Conversely, the instruments that offer abnormal yield levels now are typically the ones which do not really have solid prospects to increase their cash generation levels in the future, thereby rendering the duration factor relatively smaller than for the more growth-oriented names. This means that once the interest rates start to drop, the likely effects on the asset prices will be more favorable to SCHD's holdings than, say, for conventional high-yielding segments such as BDCs and MLPs. Meanwhile, the FOMC dot plot also indicates that it is unlikely that the SOFR will converge back to zero or extremely accommodative levels, which, in turn, should put a floor on how low the dividend yield of SCHD could drop. As a result of this, we could assume that the risk of investors facing a reinvestment risk (from the perspective of low incremental yield levels on the reinvested capital) is rather distant. The bottom line As many of my followers have probably noticed, I am a huge fan of high-yielding instruments (with average yields of 7 - 10%), which explains circa 90% of my portfolio. While some time ago I was relatively skeptical of SCHD - mostly from the opportunity cost perspective - the increase in SCHD's yield coupled with a more pronounced element of capital appreciation potential that would be associated with decreasing interest rates makes me change my stance.  In my view, at this particular moment, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF presents a compelling entry point even for high-yielding investors who are willing to consider adding some investments that offer a bit of a lower yield from the start, but also have a stronger dividend growth potential that could relatively quickly offset the foregone income potential.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

A full transcript follows the video.This video was recorded on June 29, 2024.Jim Gillies: As an outside individual and I still consider myself, in spite of what I do for a living, I still consider myself retail investor. I could hold things forever. I don't need to worry about companies meeting guidance. I'm like, you know what? I'm good.Ricky Mulvey: The market's pretty wild right now. I thought it was a good time to take a step back and look at the fundamentals evaluation. I caught up with Motley Fool Canada's Jim Gillies to talk about how regular investors can value companies before buying a stock, why a price-to-sales multiple can steer you wrong, and one advantage that retail investors have over the institutional ones. Jim, I think now is an interesting time to talk about valuation in the market. If you look at the way the equal-weighted Standard and Poor's 500 indexes have been doing compared to market-cap weighted, you can see that the big dogs are really pulling things forward. I think it's good to take a step back and give a little primer on valuation in investing and you are big valuation guy. To set the table, what's the difference between price and valuation for investors looking at any stock?Jim Gillies: Sure. I have been accused of being a valuation guy from time to time. There is a cliche that price is what you pay, and value is what you get. That's actually not bad. All a stock price tells you is what other investors or prospective investors or soon to be former investors are willing to transact at the moment. It doesn't tell you much, doesn't tell you about the underlying business, doesn't really tell you anything about what's going on. One of the things I like to do when I used to teach this stuff and with some of the other analysts that I deal with, the young analysts that I mentor, is, I always say, the two most important questions in the valuation process, because you found a stock, you're really excited about it. You might be fine buying it today after you're really excited about reading about their opportunities or whatever.But the two most important questions that come to investing are, what is it worth and why?There's multiple ways to answer certainly that first question. But the stock price is just, again, it's the stock market is what the stock market is charging for the opportunity here. It may be right. It may be wrong. It's always up for debate. Everyone, every investor is playing a different game because everybody is at a different course in their life, has a different amount of money. Maybe you're a short-term holder, maybe you're hoping to be a long-term investor, and things are always in flux. A very obvious example would be, go look at stocks in the growth, so called growth and tech stocks, software stocks, SaaS software as a service, and SPACs in 2021. Go look and see what those prices were doing. Then you can go and look at what the valuation implications of all of those prices were, and then flip them a year later and look at those same stocks and the same implications that were tied in in 2022. They're radically different, even though they're the same stocks, the same companies.Ricky Mulvey: If I'm thinking about valuation, do I have to build models of future cash flows? I know there's not just top-line growth, do I have to guess the effective tax rate for the companies I'm looking at five years from now? Are there ways to do this without getting the Excel spreadsheet out?Jim Gillies: Don't fear the Excel spreadsheet, Ricky. I like to say that every model is precisely wrong, but you do have the opportunity to be roughly right. Frankly, roughly right is going to be good enough. Warren Buffett popularize the topic, but it comes from Ben Graham, the father of value investing, the concept of margin of safety. You do the best you can, and you can make it as complicated or as uncomplicated as you want. You may observe say that a company is a particular company translates about 5% or 6% of their top-line revenue into free cash flow. That is the cash that is left over after the company has paid all of its bill, made all of its capital investments, made all of its investments and working capital. Let's say, for thousand dollars in revenue they do, they end up with 50 bucks at the end. They end up with 5%. You can look back and you do a time series, a historical analysis. You might see, they've averaged between 4.5 and 5% for the past decade. You can build a really complicated model where you can use the capital asset pricing model to fine tune your weighted average cost of capital down to 14 decimal points, and you can make an estimate for tax rates, and you can read the tea leaves to see what well, if the next president is this person, the tax rates for corporations are going to go to here, or you can just say, you know what? I'm going to be wrong on those things, but they've largely been between 4.5-5% free cash flow margin for the past decade. I'm going to forecast my growth and then I'm going to hit at 5%. I'm going to call it a day at that point. Because it's far simpler to do that, and you're going to be roughly right. Then the concept of margin of safety is, if I figure out that a stock, at any particular company is worth say $100 a share. Well, if the stock is trading at $100 a share, that's not a great deal. Maybe I buy a few shares just to get my head in the game. But if that stock is trading at 80, that's a 20% margin of safety. That's going to allow you to have made a significant number of errors during your valuation process. Maybe the next couple of years, they only do 4.5% free cash flow. They underperform what you're expecting. It's not going to matter if you bought a discount to free cash flow. Similarly, if the company and this is always wonderful when it happens, when a company outperforms your expectations, and you've bought it at a margin of safety, it becomes magical because you get both, the company outperforms what you were expecting and you bought at a discount.Ricky Mulvey: Does a regular investor though have any hope of playing this game better than Wall Street analysts who do this for 12 hours a day and have fancier software, access to better data on Bloomberg terminals, that thing. It seems like if you're playing this game, you might be at significant disadvantages to a lot of professionals?Jim Gillies: The professionals are at the disadvantage. Because the professionals being graded quarterly. They're running a fund, and they tossed up a couple of garbage picks during the quarter. They're probably having an uncomfortable conversation with their portfolio manager at the end of the quarter. Do it several quarters in a row, and you're probably having an uncomfortable conversation with your HR department, as you negotiate your exit. It is constant, what have you done for me lately? It's almost except for the rare shops, which can do their own thing and go their own way, it's inherently short-term minded. As an outside individual, and I still consider myself, in spite of what I do for a living, I still consider myself retail investor. I could hold things forever. I don't need to worry about companies meeting guidance. I'm like, you know what? I'm good. You can take the time. I've sat on a couple of stocks that have done nothing for years which would probably get me a talking to working for that large fund company on Wall Street. They do nothing for three, four, five years, and then they quadruple in three months. Those are fun.Ricky Mulvey: That sounds like fun. Is this exercise, if you're doing this? Are you better off spending your time? It seems like you'd be better off spending your time with smaller companies, not the companies with all eyes with the eye of Sauron upon them?Jim Gillies: Well, yes and no. It's an interesting exercise. Usually, if you are one of the few who is, if you are playing in the small cap world, which is where I usually play, you can have an advantage. Big funds can't come in and own it in any size to matter. If you're dealing with $1 billion company and a fund can only buy up to 5% of a company $50 million. That fund is a $10 billion fund. They're not going to look. Where I think you have again, this ties into the short termism. My favorite example of the species is Q4 of 2018. Now, people don't remember because we have short term memory most of the time. 2018 was a dismal year for the market. I wrote a column back then called The Year No One Made Money. I went through all the major asset classes and just, like bonds were down, stocks were down. The marijuana stock sector, which was big in Canada in 2018, it was down. Bitcoin was down. Housing prices were down. I know that never happens. But like every major asset class, nothing made money in 2018. You got to the end of 2018 and going into early 2019. There's this small fruit company at a Cupertino, California, Apple or something.Ricky Mulvey: We're doing that if you haven't heard of Apple game.Jim Gillies: Exactly. Apple at the time was the largest company by market cap in the world. Apple was trading at 10 times free cash flow, 10 times operating profit as well. Ballpark. I don't have my spreadsheet open, so ballpark. All of the stories at the time. All of all of the words of the wise, everything coming out was that Apple's growth was gone. Apple was going to struggle to respark growth. They hadn't had any really new innovative products for a few years. Steve Jobs had been gone for seven years at that point, and really, 78 years by that point. That Tim Cook guy well he's a good operator, but he's know Steve Jobs and on and on. You didn't need a detailed spreadsheet analyzing every product line and the rise of services. You didn't need that to go, here is Apple, the largest company in the world by market cap, the biggest cash generation story that I've seen in my career, and I've been doing this for a while, that had a really interesting habit of returning all of the cash and then sum to shareholders in the form of a small dividend and very large stock buybacks. When you tell people that Apples bought back over the last decade, about 40% of their stock, generally comes as a shock to them, but they have. Now, say, well they give lots of equity cook to the insiders. About 12-15% of the stock they buy back has gone back into the pool for employees, and that's just a cause of doing business. But they're still very much focused on returning that cash check to investors and reducing their share count, which ratchets up the stock price. But the sentiment about Apple at that time was very negative just in the popular press. Like I said, it got down about 10 times free cash flow. All the eyes are on Apple Ricky at that point. This is not an unknown stock at this point. If I told you Apple's been a five plus bagger since then in barely over five years, would you believe me?Ricky Mulvey: I'd open another tab, but I don't want to do that.Jim Gillies: Well, I promise you I'm correct on that. Because I was a very heavy buyer in late 2018 or early 2019. But that's where you didn't need to come up with a giant spreadsheet to forecast all these things. You can do it. But, again, there's the concept of declining utility. All you really needed to know was premier cash generating story of our generation and religious about returning that cash of shareholders. Fantastic relative valuation relative being. I didn't build a DCF discounted cash flow model. I'm using a relative valuation metric. In this case, price to free cash flow, EV to free cash flow.Ricky Mulvey: There any, price tag metrics that you used to help find those stories? We got our price to sales, we got our price to earnings. You mentioned price to free cash flow, which is especially useful for a mature business. You're smirking and shaking your head just a little bit for the listeners who can't see, Jim?Jim Gillies: This is where I go off on. Number 1, I hate the price to sales multiple. I hate anything multiple to sales. Hate it all. You didn't really see that a lot, frankly, until about five, six years ago. The previous time where I'd seen it even used at all was largely in the tech bubble in 99, 2000 era. There's no faster way for me to throw out an investing thesis and to have an analyst tell me, well, this is cheap. It's trading at only 20 times sales. I'm old enough to remember when 20 times earnings was considered starting to get into richly valued. But that's because sales is at the top of the income statement, and earnings is at the bottom of the income statement. Earnings is after, in theory, at least on an accrual basis, after we've paid for all of the operating costs and the cost of sales of the business. I loathe the price of sales multiple, and the only times I can actually remember using it, I used it to illustrate a problem with the formerly largest company in Canadian history. I would be Nortel Networks because I showed how for those who don't know, Nortel Networks is the giant cautionary tale for most Canadian investors. It was the largest company in Canada, It was the largest company in Canadian history, frankly, by market cap. I think it hit about $350 billion in mid 2000. It's zero today. Largest company in in history to zero in less than two decades. That's some good work. But at the time, this is going back a long time ago. But basically, when Nortel started rolling over, and Nortel was a company that on a split adjusted, or I should say, reverse split adjusted basis, all time high about $1,250 Canadian dollars per share. It bottomed at $6.60 about two years later, less than two years later. That's about a 99.5% drop for those playing along at home. All the way down, I would have family members, I would have friends, acquaintances, as soon as they we talk investing, I'm going to buy me some Nortel. It's come down so far. It's got to go back up. No, it doesn't. It's under no obligation to go back up, just because it's come down so far and you think it's got to go back up. The exercise I was running was like, at the time Nortel, they had turned cash flow negative. They had turned accounting negative, like, accounting profit negative. Really, you had to move up, and the only thing they had that was a positive number at that time was really their sales. I would use the price to sales multiple and say, here's a company from 92-98 traded 1.5- 2 times sales. But because sales went up six times over that period, the stock went up about six bagger. It followed the valuation. In 1999, it went from two time sales to 10 times sales. The multiple expanded by a factor of five, and through a combination of a little bit of enthusiasm in the market and the markets they were serving, as well as making a couple of really turned out boneheaded acquisitions, they doubled their sales in a year. They doubled their sales and the multiple on sales went up five x. Nortel in 1999 was a 10 bagger. But I showed, those six years went up six times in value, that's fine because on a relative basis, it actually never got more expensive. That one year 99, where, the CEO at the time, John Roth he was feted in every magazine and every newspaper as the CEO of the year. No, Dude just got on the right side of a momentum wave and caught it and was smart enough to bail out and take a $100 million home the next year. Good for him. But the price of sales ratio I'm going to differ with some other people, some other Fools who are not going to agree with me, and that's fine. If all you got to hang your hat on is the price of sales ratio, you're probably going to get hurt.Ricky Mulvey: We've not talked about price to earnings.Jim Gillies: The price, it's the most quoted. It's fine.Ricky Mulvey: You seem very tepid. It's to give you a price tag. You say price to sales doesn't give you any of the costs and expenses, a price to earnings. That'll give you some costs and expenses to which you can compare that company against other companies in that category.Jim Gillies: Sure or against its own history. My main problem with priced earnings is again, there's no leverage consideration. There is non-operating expenses or income can skew the earnings line sometimes. If you're going to use an earnings multiple, Number 1, you want to be consistent, you want to look at the company over time. You want to be consistent and use your measures all the way along. Also living in the grand age of adjusted numbers. Now every number is adjusted 17 ways to Sunday. We've apparently forgotten that EBITDA is a made up number anyway.Ricky Mulvey: There's too many problems with GAP. They have too many rules, doesn't work for my company. I'm sorry, but keep going.Jim Gillies: Well, actually, that's valid in a lot of cases. But my take on price earnings is it can be fine. Like anything, like any tool, hammer works great as a hammer. It might work OK as a lever. It's a terrible wheel. You want to have multiple tools that you can bring to bear. When all those different tools, maybe you are telling you similar stories, that's something to pay attention to and say, I think this is pretty decent. Accounting earnings is fine, but it's not cash flow. If you're going to force me to use a relative metric and a quick metric, I am going to be a fan of a free cash flow multiple. But then, so whether that's price or whether it's enterprise value, we can, there's applications for each. But that's still only part of the story because then what does a company do with its free cash flow? There's a company in Winnipeg Manitoba, Canada called Win-Pack of all things, and has been a tremendous cash generator over the past I'm going to say decade or, so for most of its history. It's really well. It makes plastic cups. If you like the little cup that your single serving pringles come in or your single serving cups or little jams you get at the diner. Congratulations you're using a Win-Pack product. They made a tremendous amount of cash. They're really well managed. They respect their equity by that, I mean, they're not, constantly deluding themselves. But the cash has just piled up on the balance sheet. I tell very recently, they haven't done anything with it for almost a decade. It's like, that's great. You're piling it up on the balance sheet, and I guess maybe its value is it makes some interest income, except until the last year and a half, the last two years, we've been in historically low interest rate environment. Who cares. As opposed to companies where company, I think we've talked about before in the past, Ricky, company called Medpace Holdings. I know we've talked about them.Ricky Mulvey: But diagnostic testing.Jim Gillies: It's a great company, contract research organization run by a really great, foolish founding CEO who continues to be the CEO and largest shareholder. He founded the company 32, 33 years ago. They were piling up the cash, tremendously cash generative debt free. They were piling up cash on their balance sheet until late 2020, early 2021. Then the stock got continually whacked. Every earnings report was down 15%, even though every earnings report looked pretty good, actually. The market just wasn't believing that things could be that good there. You saw Medpace Holdings, which, I believe, had about 425 million cash at its peak. They blew all of it buying their stock back, and they took on some debt and threw that against it because no one else is going to respect the equity, and they were buying it, between 130-150 cent. The stock is 400 and change today. It was a tremendous capital allocation move, but they were piling up that cash from their free cash flow generating ability. Then when opportunity presented itself, you might say when the valuation was attractive, and they knew they were worth more than the market was given. They said, fine, we will take advantage of this, and they did.Ricky Mulvey: Let's wrap up with this part of the conversation, Jim, I think we have more to talk about. I think there's another show in here. With using some of the multiples we've talked about that you have very tepid feelings about to at least talk about one story. That's one you've mentioned on the show, that's Academy Sports and Outdoors, especially in comparison to Dick's Sporting Goods. These are companies that are pretty easy to compare because they're sporting goods retailers. But the investment community is not just on a market cap basis, but also on a multiple basis, much more optimistic about the future of Dick's Sporting Goods. We'll use the price to free cash flow multiple. Dick's Sporting Goods is about a 17 times free cash flow multiple. But Academy Sports and Outdoors is it an eight times free cash flow multiple, less than half. Even though maybe it has more room to expand, its store count while Dick is a more mature business. Why is the market so much more feeling the way you feel toward multiples about Academy Sports and Outdoors you think?Jim Gillies: I am asking myself that same question because Academy Sports and Outdoor. It's probably one of my favorite stocks right now for buying new shares of today. I don't know why the market is valuing Dick's more. I think it was 2019. I'm going to be precisely wrong here, but I'm going to try to make up for it. 2019, I believe this is before Academy even IPOed, at one point they were voted retailer most likely to go bankrupt by someone. I don't know. I remember who appeared, but I thought that was funny. They largely switched out, and they were greatly underperforming in terms of sales per square foot and same store sales and all the things that we look at for retail change. They did a wholesale management change. Again, this is pre IPO. They basically sent the present incumbents out, and they brought in new folks, and they came forward with a five year financial plan. Here's what our sales are going to be in five years. Here's our net income margin, here's our how many times we're going to turn our inventory. Here's our target return on invested capital. Here's our target sales per square foot. Here's our percentage of e-commerce sales. Spoiler, they hit all their metrics that they laid out well before the five years had gone out. This new management team is excellent. About a year ago, Academy Sports and Outdoor actually brought out a second five year plan that they're working on.I've used that plan to inform my valuation model, and I'm not just using multiples here, Ricky. I do have an actual DCF built on this one. I'm not as optimistic as management is. I'll put it that way. This five-year plan, they want to be at over $10 billion in sales by the time this five year plan is done. I think in year five, I've got them just shy of nine billion sales as I look at my spreadsheet here. I've got slightly lower margins, free cash flow margin. Right now, we're running about 8% on a trailing basis. My model, I don't have them any higher than 6.5% over the course of the next decade or so I think I'm penalizing them appropriately for their cost of capital and for growth beyond the next decade or so. I've made sure I valued all of the outstanding stock options that are going to go to insiders and make sure that I detract that from the business, make sure I take off their debt. It's real hard for me to get a stock value that's under $80 right now and the stocks trading at 52, I think. Where that comes back to the multiple. Again, I'm aware of the Dick's thing because we have talked about Dick's before, but I've not done a similar amount of deep dive work into Dick's Sporting goods, because it's a little largerthan I want. I like the smaller and the upstart. I own several US-facing index tracking ETFs. I figure I've got enough exposure to Dick's Sporting goods through those ETFs. But where it comes back is when you see peer groups, when you see two companies in peer, and it's on and you see one at such a sharp discount to the other in terms of valuation metric that I do like, which, as you've used, is a free cash low multiple. That's a good place to start your research and go, OK, so what's going on here? Why do we have Maybe you find out that, one store is just so much better, well run than other, and you start finding reasons for the discrepancy. I will say this. The setup is going to get me in trouble, I'm sure in a year or two, but the setup for Academy Sports and Outdoor really reminds me of are you familiar with Sprouts Farmers Market?Ricky Mulvey: Yes, I am.Jim Gillies: The organic grocery, poor man's Whole Foods. This reminds me of the setup for Sprouts Farmers Market about 3.5, four years ago. That is the market just doesn't care about the prospects. Sprouts was hovering around 24-25. I recommended it a couple of times, 25-30. Again, run the DCF. This is undervalued, look on a multiple basis. It's actually cheaper than other grocery stores who have lower profit margins than they do. They have good management who had a very clear and stated plan going forward. I built a DCF that undercut the plan of the insiders, which is conservative measure. I'm like yeah, I still can't get the stock price below. It's minimum, 40% upside from here. Then stock basically tripled in a year and a half. As the market caught up with it. That's the setup I'm looking at with Academy here. Then the last piece of the puzzle is, again, remember what I said earlier, what does the company do with its free cash flow? It's lovely to be cheap visa vi it's cash generation. But what are you doing with it? If you are utilizing it in the service of shareholders, and in the case of Sprouts, what they were doing is they have very minimal leverage, they have more cash than debt. They were aggressively shrinking their share count by buying shares back. When I first started looking at Sprouts a few years ago, at 150 million shares, I think they might be around 100 million today. That, by the way, that's going on with academy sports as well. They are aggressively shrinking their share count, pay a tiny pittance of a dividend, whatever. But when you get all of those things working together, the multiple say it's cheap. The DCF discounted cash flow multiple says it's cheap. You can see with your own eyes the cashiering ability of the company, and they're using it in the service of shareholders at which, you may or may not be one, or you may or may not be a larger shareholder.Ricky Mulvey: It's on my watch list.Jim Gillies: Well, what I'm saying is, if you see that happening, I think that's a really good, solid place for you to enter hopefully what will be a long term relationship with a fantastic company, which is really all we're looking for here.Ricky Mulvey: That's a good place to end it. Jim Gillies. Let's do this again. I think we have more to talk about. Appreciate your time and your insight. Thanks for being here.Jim Gillies: Thank you, sir.Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don't buyer sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Ricky Mulvey. Thanks for listening. We'll be back tomorrow",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
2KPa4SEJvBrdoG6,Yahoo Finance,bing,TD Cowen: Saks-Neiman Deal Likely a Boon to Both Retailers Amid Brand Moves to DTC,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/td-cowen-saks-neiman-deal-211625313.html,2024-07-05 17:57,2024-07-05 18:06,AMZN,,"The $2.65-billion Saks and Neiman Marcus merger could be a boon to both retailers given premium and luxury brands‚Äô recent direct-to-consumer shifts, according to TD Cowen luxury and retail analyst Oliver Chen.Word surfaced Wednesday that Richard Baker‚Äôs Hudson‚Äôs Bay Co. (HBC) had finally reached an agreement to buy Neiman Marcus Group for $2.65 billion. Baker, who had been vying for a merger between subsidiary Saks and Neiman for about a decade, is finally on the verge of realizing a long-held dream.More from Sourcing JournalSaks Fifth Avenue Owner to Buy Neiman Marcus for $2.65 Billion-With Aid from AmazonAmerican Exchange Group Acquires Footwear Label Island Surf CompanyNeiman Marcus Cyber Attacker Looks to Sell Hacked Data of 'High Value Rich¬†Targets!'Amazon and Salesforce are minority investors in the transaction, which is awaiting customary Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approval‚Äîwhich isn‚Äôt guaranteed. The FTC is also checking out Tapestry Inc.‚Äôs proposed $8.5-billion transaction to acquire Capri Holdings, a move that has incurred significant scrutiny from the nation‚Äôs consumer protection agency.As for whether the Saks-Neiman merger makes good business sense, Chen said the deal is a positive ‚Äúgiven the luxury industry‚Äôs high degree of supplier concentration, nature of intense competition, and need for store, technology, people, and logistical investments.‚ÄùThe plan is for the two to combine to create Saks Global, which combined will account for $10 billion in annual sales, comprised of $6 billion from Saks and $4 billion from Neiman.Chen expects luxury brands to continue to grow their DTC channels, and for Saks and Neiman to move more toward concession spaces, which, similar to shop-in-shops, are brand-operated-and-licensed segments of stores. Popular in European and Asian luxury retail, the concession model will help propel Saks‚Äô and Neiman‚Äôs growth, he believes.The digitalization of retail has fostered an intensely competitive and promotional environment. Luxury retailers have also faced declining store traffic, elevated inventory levels as aspirational consumers pull back on spending, and greater discounts and price matching.Chen thinks a merger can yield a strong combined entity that will invest more in stores, people, marketing and technology, while also offsetting supplier and customer leverage.‚ÄúWe believe the rationale of the proposed acquisition is centered on brick-and-clicks, given the intensifying competition with Nordstrom and Bloomingdale‚Äôs and the ongoing consolidation of the digital multi-brand industry, including Net-a-Porter, Mytheresa, and Luisaviaroma,‚Äù Chen said. ‚ÄúThus, luxury leaders will need to combine or quickly build physical scale.‚ÄùStory continuesChen also said the Saks-Neiman merger will allow the business to invest more in stores, while investments from Amazon and Salesforce could result in a more advanced customer data platform across categories.Both retailers‚Äô growing stables of premier and emerging luxury brands could help Saks Global penetrate new regions while mitigating fights for exclusivity and regional licenses, Chen said. Amazon and Salesforce investments could help drive speed of delivery, though it‚Äôs possible Amazon will in turn leverage insights from the operations as it tries to grow its own luxury retail arm.The deal for Neiman Marcus includes its five Last Call outlet stores and two Bergdorf Goodman doors. Should the FTC approve the transaction, Saks CEO Marc Metrick will become CEO of Saks Global.HBC partnered with capital growth investor Insight Partners in 2021, resulting in the e-commerce business of Saks Fifth Avenue becoming a standalone firm known as Saks. Saks retained ownership and control of the Saks Fifth Avenue intellectual property, including the brand and visual identity. Baker‚Äôs HBC retained ownership of the Saks physical store operation.Neiman Marcus went through two leverage buyouts, the first a $5.1-billion sale to private equity firms TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus in 2005, and the second when the two sold the retailer in 2013 for $6 billion to private equity firm Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

Nuclear energy, which is virtually carbon free and provides around-the-clock power, has become a top pick for the data center industry.Talen announced in March that it had entered into an agreement to sell electricity and a data center campus located at its Pennsylvania nuclear power plant to Amazon Web Services. The deal would provide Amazon's computer warehouses with an electric capacity of up to 960 megawatts, or enough to power about a million homes.A handful of electric utilities, including American Electric Power and Exelon, last month asked FERC to hold a hearing to more deeply scrutinize Talen's interconnection agreement with Amazon or deny it outright. The group said the interconnection agreement for the data center could result in a $140 million per year cost shift to everyday ratepayers.(Reporting by Laila Kearney; Editing by Josie Kao)",0.0,True,"Talen Energy has asked U.S. regulators to dismiss a challenge to its recent data center agreement with Amazon.

EnvcgI4c0SUGkWz,The Motley Fool,google,Is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Stock a Buy?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/05/is-advanced-micro-devices-amd-a-buy/,2024-07-05 18:33,2024-07-05 18:38,NVDA,,"Chip company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 4.88%) has been relegated to second fiddle to Nvidia (NVDA -1.91%) in the artificial intelligence (AI) craze. The stock's 40% returns over the past year aren't anything to sneeze at, but they pale in comparison to Nvidia's triple-digit performance.Whether the stock has further upside depends on how much AI can impact AMD's business over the coming years.Big things are happening at AMD, and this long-term investor is going deep into the company's finances to determine if it's good enough to justify buying the stock now.Here is what I found in my exploration of AMD.AMD's most important segments are on fireNobody is arguing that Nvidia dominates the market for chips used in data centers to run powerful AI models. In Q1, Nvidia's Data Center segment revenue was over $22 billion, roughly what AMD's entire company did over the past four quarters. However, there are always niches within a broader market, and that's where AMD can earn its living.Even as an underdog, AMD's Data Center sales grew 80% year over year in Q1. Additionally, AMD's AI opportunity extends beyond direct competition with Nvidia. For example, AMD is a significant player in supplying chips used in personal computers and devices. This unit (Client segment) grew its sales by 85% year over year in Q1 as computer manufacturers started integrating AI technology. These two fast-growing units are over half of AMD's business.Unfortunately, AMD's other two segments, Gaming and Embedded, offset that growth with steep declines. While management anticipates that Embedded revenue will grow once inventory issues pass, the Gaming unit is cyclical and in a slow period. The result was that total revenue grew just 2% year over year in Q1. Analysts believe AMD's full-year sales will come in at $25.5 billion, a 10% increase over 2023, so things could pick up over the next few quarters.Hitting 10% growth for the year is solid, even if it looks bad compared to Nvidia's eye-popping results.The big picture looks brightThe hope is that the fast-growing Data Center and Client segments become larger and speed up AMD's overall growth. Analysts agree; current revenue estimates are $32.6 billion for 2025, which would work out to a 27% increase. This doesn't look like a short-term fluke, either. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, believes the AI chip market will grow to $400 billion by 2027.Do the math: Nvidia, with market-share estimates as high as 90%, is on track for just over $100 billion in data center revenue this year. That means a significant amount of future market share is still up for grabs as the broader demand for AI chips continues climbing. AMD grabbing even 5% of a $400 billion market would be $20 billion in Data Center segment sales, roughly double what it's on pace for this year.Five-percent market share is a small number, so even doing a little better than that could make a big difference. Currently, Nvidia is the runaway leader, but holding onto so much of a large market can be hard. And if AMD can't steal any more market share? That would dim the big picture, but AMD still has other units to create growth. Again, its second-largest business segment (Client) just grew 85%!This isn't an AI-or-nothing story.Is AMD a buy?Investors must consider how much of AMD's future growth is already in the share price.Analysts estimate AMD will earn $3.41 per share in 2024, up 28% from 2023. Additionally, estimates call for annual earnings growth averaging 33% for the next three to five years, which makes sense if AMD's Data Center and Client units continue to grow and successfully accelerate AMD's broader growth. Shares trade at 48 times estimated 2024 earnings, which would generally be an expensive price tag for most stocks.However, the apparent and growing demand for AI chips could create growth that justifies a high starting valuation like this. Assuming AMD delivers as hoped and hits those estimates, investors could buy today and be pleased with the results three to five years from now.Investors should closely monitor AMD's performance and remember that shares will become increasingly risky if the stock price keeps rising from here. However, those who believe AMD can and will carve out its space in AI are looking at a reasonable buying opportunity today.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its accompanying SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) added 1.86% for the week. Wall Street's benchmark index kicked off H2 2024 with its best weekly performance since late April. Remarkably, the gauge is now within striking distance of the 5,600 level, and is close to topping the year-end target of several brokerages who have scrambled to keep up with the inexorable bull run. This week's gains were largely driven by labor market data that has supported the case for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts; some dovish commentary from Fed chair Jerome Powell and the minutes of the central bank's last monetary policy meeting; and electric vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) rediscovering some of its mojo. Market participants also saw a mid-week break with Independence Day falling on Thursday.  Fed chief Powell took the stage at an annual event organized by the European Central Bank (ECB) on Tuesday, speaking on a panel alongside ECB President Christine Lagarde and Banco Central do Brasil Governor Roberto Campos Neto. The U.S. central bank leader said recent data was now showing sings of resuming a ""disinflationary trend."" Also on Tuesday, Tesla (TSLA) stock added nearly $70B in market capitalization after the Elon Musk-led firm beat consensus estimates on quarterly deliveries. Wednesday's truncated trading session saw the economic calendar grab the spotlight. In particular, the following two indicators on the labor market received some attention: ADP Research Institute's update for June showed job creation among private employers slowing for a third straight month, and continuing jobless claims climbed for a ninth consecutive week to continue hovering near its highest level since November 2021. The labor market data culminated in Friday's closely watched nonfarm payrolls report. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs growth slowed in June, while the number for May was also revised lower. Additionally, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1% from 4.0%. Along with inflation, a highly resilient labor market has been one of the main reasons why the Fed has held interest rates steady and has been hesitant to start easing monetary policy. But this week's developments have bolstered market expectations for a 25 basis point rate cut to be delivered as soon as September.  Inflation will be back in focus next week, with the latest consumer and producer price index reports. Eyes will also be on Fed chair Powell as he heads to Congress to deliver his semiannual report on monetary policy. Finally, the second quarter earnings season will kick off with major banks reporting next Friday.  Turning to the weekly performance of the S&P 500 (SP500) sectors, six of the 11 ended in the green. Heavyweight growth names Communication Services, Technology and Consumer Discretionary led the winners with gains of nearly 4% each. Energy topped the losers.

6Jp2IUZ5U6B8J7K,BBC,bing,France ends ugly campaign and draws breath before historic vote,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wenlvn55lo,2024-07-05 19:08,2024-07-05 19:18,COST,,"France‚Äôs rushed and sometimes violent election campaign is over, brought to an end with stark appeals from political leaders ahead of Sunday‚Äôs pivotal vote. Centrist Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said on Friday night that a far-right government would ‚Äúunleash hatred and violence‚Äù. But the leader of the National Rally, Jordan Bardella, accused his rivals of immoral, anti-democratic behaviour, and he urged voters to mobilise and give him an outright majority. One in three French voters backed National Rally (RN) last Sunday, in the first round of parliamentary elections. The choice a week on is between France‚Äôs first far-right government of modern times or political deadlock, and voters fear there is turmoil ahead whoever wins. The climate is so fraught that 30,000 extra police are being deployed.  Interior Minister G√©rald Darmanin said 51 candidates, or their deputies or party activists, had been physically attacked by people of varying backgrounds, including some who were ‚Äúspontaneously angry‚Äù. In one incident, an extremist network published a list of almost 100 lawyers ""for eliminating"", after they signed an open letter against National Rally. President Emmanuel Macron‚Äôs decision to call it less than a month ago came as a shock, but the consequences are unknown. When voters speak about the election, the tension is often palpable. Kaltoun‚Äôs hair is covered and says in her town on the border with Belgium, where RN won the first round, she and her daughter have felt increasingly uncomfortable. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a remark or a look; each election it‚Äôs got worse.‚Äù In nearby Tourcoing, G√©rald Darmanin is facing a strong challenge to hold his seat from the far-right candidate who was just 800 votes behind him last Sunday. That is why left-wing candidate Leslie Mortreux decided to pull out of the second round to give him a better chance of defeating RN. In the 500 seats being decided by run-off votes, 217 candidates from the left-wing New Popular Front and the Macron Ensemble alliance have withdrawn to block the RN from winning. Although dozens of three-way races are still going ahead, 409 seats will now be decided by one-on-one contests. After the first round, some opinion polls gave RN a chance of winning an outright majority in the National Assembly. The final polls of the campaign suggest that is no longer on the cards. Even if RN boss Marine Le Pen believes they still have a ‚Äúserious chance‚Äù of winning the 289 seats they need to control the Assembly, the pollsters say about 200 is a more realistic figure. One major poll that came out hours before the end of the campaign suggested that the awkward series of withdrawals by third-placed left-wing and centrist candidates had succeeded in scuppering the hopes of National Rally boss Marine Le Pen‚Äôs protege of becoming prime minister aged 28. ‚ÄúWe are presiding over the birth of a single M√©lenchon-Macron party,‚Äù Jordan Bardella complained. ‚ÄúAnd this dishonorable alliance has been formed with the single goal of keeping us from winning.‚Äù The Popular Front is made up of Socialists, Greens and Communists, but its biggest party is France Unbowed, led by radical firebrand Jean-Luc M√©lenchon. He is widely condemned by his rivals as an extremist, and he is certainly no ally of President Emmanuel Macron. Despite their agreement to keep out the far right, there is no love lost between the two camps. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt beat the far right with the far left,‚Äù the interior minister said, even though a France Unbowed candidate had pulled out to help him win. The Macron centrists are third in the polls, well behind the Popular Front as well as the National Rally. ‚ÄúIn France we‚Äôre fed up with Macron, and I‚Äôm more in the centre‚Äù said Marc in Tourcoing. ‚ÄúThe cost of living is bad, and the rich have become richer and the poor are poorer."" National Rally has focused its campaign on media appearances by Mr Bardella and Marine Le Pen, and there have been claims of ‚Äúphantom candidates‚Äù barely showing up in some areas. When one candidate in the city of Orl√©ans, √âlodie Babin, qualified for the second round with little attempt at campaigning she later insisted she had been ill for 10 days. RN is especially popular in rural areas. In Mennecy, a sleepy town in the Essonne area south of Paris, Mathieu Hillaire was holding his final campaign event as Popular Front candidate. He is in a duel with RN candidate Nathalie Da Conceicao Carvalho, after the pro-Macron candidate pulled out to give her left-wing rival a better chance of blocking the far right. Mr Hillaire said while the climate was less tense locally than elsewhere some people were still worried: ‚ÄúOf the voters that I‚Äôve met, there are many who are scared of Jordan Bardella.‚Äù Many of RN‚Äôs policies focus on cutting the cost of living and tackling law and order, but their ant-immigration plans have raised particular concerns. RN aims to give French citizens ‚Äúnational preference‚Äù over immigrants for jobs and housing, and wants to abolish the right to automatic French citizenship for children of foreign parents, if those children have spent five years in France from the age of 11 to 18. Dual citizens would also be barred from dozens of sensitive jobs. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal spoke of an ‚Äúuncertainty and worry‚Äù among the French people. He said in the first round his party had averted the risk of Jean-Luc M√©lenchon winning a majority. Now the risk came a far right whose policies would ‚Äúunleash hatred and violence with a plan to stigmatise some of our fellow citizens‚Äù and be catastrophic for the French economy. But what happens on Sunday night if there is deadlock, and no obvious way forward towards forming a government? The Olympic Games are now only 20 days away, and there is a suggestion that France might have no government or prime minister when it hosts such a high-profile global event. Mr Attal, who had earlier suggested his minority government might stay in place ‚Äúas long as necessary‚Äù, was far more vague on Friday night. ‚ÄúNext week I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll be doing, where‚Äôll I‚Äôll be doing it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I know who I‚Äôll be doing it for: the people of France, that‚Äôs all that counts for me.‚Äù Copyright 2024 BBC.

WoFvcSx6tdSE90t,BBC,bing,"After the impotence of opposition, Keir Starmer prepares to wield power",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c725z55d75ko,2024-07-05 20:04,2024-07-05 20:21,ARM,,"‚ÄúA face of thunder.‚Äù As opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer would go back to his office after the Queen‚Äôs Speech deeply frustrated after witnessing the Conservatives‚Äô plans laid out year after year. He carried the curse of the leader of the opposition ‚Äì irrelevance. He formally became prime minister at lunchtime on Friday, but for a number of months now, he has also known that the British state has been quietly preparing for his arrival in Downing Street. ‚ÄúWe have every hour of his first day, every day of his first week, every week of his first month, mapped out,"" is how one Whitehall source put it. What promise this victory holds is not going to fail because of a lack of homework or planning. Such is the level of preparation that the Treasury, in anticipation of the arrival of the first female chancellor, has apparently boxed in the urinal that has long been a feature of the chancellor‚Äôs private bathroom. Not exactly bog standard stuff, you could say (sorry!) Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Rachel Reeves is one of the prominent figures in Sir Keir‚Äôs team, among them also Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson, who have been deeply involved for months in getting ready to govern. Senior civil servants and their shadow ministers have been talking for some time and Sir Keir and some of his team have been regular attendees at Cobra meetings, and security briefings. One, now a cabinet minister, told me: ‚ÄúWe have got personal relationships with the permanent secretary and the senior officials already.‚Äú The former civil servant Sue Gray, who will now be the PM's chief of staff, has been in regular contact with Cabinet Secretary Sir Simon Case, since the turn of the year. After the headlines of the Labour leader's missions had been turned into policies, they were then made into ‚Äúimplementation plans"" for government. The calls between Ms Gray and Sir Simon became almost daily. There has been some perhaps less obvious assistance, too. At least two former Conservative ministers have been helping them prepare, including one recent cabinet minister who told me: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ridiculous we just hand over a trillion pound budget‚Äù without the kind of transition that an American president, for example, enjoys. Despite the scale of victory, the Labour manifesto, based on Sir Keir‚Äôs mission, is not about to be usurped with a huge bold unknown move. ‚ÄúThere are no secrets,‚Äù one senior figure told me. Another source told me the election result is a vindication of the PM's cautious approach and it is not a ‚Äúvote for a more radical, bold approach‚Äù. Expect strong resistance to any calls from the left that the scale of the change ‚Äúproves‚Äù Labour could have been more radical in what they put forward. Some in his party may demand a rapid cessation of arm sales to Israel. Labour losing seats and nearly losing others to opponents standing on a pro-Gaza platform will only make those calls more urgent. Other demands may include an overt commitment to safeguard public services, a longer-term promise to remove the two-child benefit cap and even regular trade union access to Number 10. But with a massive majority, there is no suggestion that Sir Keir will feel he is in the mood to redraft his carefully worked out plans. Instead the new prime minister has held up the result as a rejection of the Tory Party and a vote for a different type of leadership, and frankly, less drama. But his style, and the gradual way in which his plans were built over a period of many months, belies some very significant changes Labour wants. These include an expansion of rights for workers, a rapid overhaul of the planning system and a state energy company. In the short-term, new ministers are likely to do everything they can to talk up how they want to get the economy to grow. It won‚Äôt be entirely coincidental if within a few weeks, companies start writing cheques for the UK, or that pent -up investments that were waiting for a change of government start to come through. And it‚Äôs likely that before long there will be new draft laws to give more powers to the government‚Äôs independent economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. One of the big first decisions the new chancellor needs to make is when to hold a huge review of the public finances with the teeth clenching decisions it might involve. The so-called spending review, which portions out cash between departments, expires at the end of the year. It sounds like a dull decision but it is massively important. Ms Reeves will have to decide whether to roll over the existing Tory spending plans for a year, to give her more space to work out a longer-term plan, or crack on with her own review by the end of 2024. Watch this space. The Labour mantra in public, and in private has been not just to win, but to be ready to get things done. In their mind are what they see as the lessons of New Labour and Tony Blair‚Äôs frustration with the slow pace of change. One new minister tells of a meeting where they briefed the former PM about their plans and he warned them: ‚ÄúI so deeply regret that we didn‚Äôt hit the ground running on reform."" ‚ÄúKeir has taken this incredibly seriously,"" the minister told me. Appointing the cabinet‚Äôs been done, but there are dozens of other MPs to receive government jobs, with advisers and new members of the House of Lords. They include the former Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance who has been appointed as a minister of state at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.  I‚Äôm told the former health secretary, Alan Milburn, is likely to take a senior, though not ministerial, role at the Department of Health to help drive waiting lists down. Other departments and other appointments might throw up some interesting names. But for all the preparation and experience, the receipt of power and responsibility is huge. One official said of incoming prime ministers: ‚ÄúThey come in exhausted from this now-seemingly endless campaign, they come in elated, they appoint their cabinet ‚Äì that is a great moment for them. And then sour-faced people like me say, ‚Äònow, can I talk to you about the end of the world!‚Äô‚Äù Sir Keir is in a hurry not just to show the public that his government can actually get things done after years of visible political shambles. But he‚Äôs also been counselled to make the most of the early goodwill from his vast ranks of new victors, before, inevitably in time, however long, the Parliamentary Labour Party starts to flex its muscles. One former Labour adviser told me, he should ""Go quick! Go Fast, before they find the loos!"" It is true that his team has tried very hard to control the quality of candidates, and many loyalists will be picking up their pass for the first day in the big palace soon. But as former prime ministers have found, bright-eyed new recruits don‚Äôt stay eager forever. Labour‚Äôs scale of victory is something they could have hardly dreamed of not so long ago. But their elation this weekend doesn‚Äôt make some of the very tricky realities of governing go away. Whenever she‚Äôs been near a microphone in recent months, Ms Reeves has been warning of what she calls the ‚Äúworst economic inheritance since the Second World War‚Äú or as she said at her election count in Leeds ‚Äúthere is not a huge amount of money‚Äù. Waiting lists are sky high. Prisons are overcrowded. Millions of families are struggling to make ends meet. This was an election result driven partly by voters‚Äô clear feeling that nothing works. That sense is not confined to public perception. As one senior Whitehall official told me: ‚ÄúThings really are worse on the inside than you can see from outside."" Labour‚Äôs ministerial teams have been discussing how to tell the public how bad, in their view, things really are. No sooner had Mr Streeting been appointed health secretary than he said: ‚ÄúFrom today the policy of this department is that the NHS is broken.‚Äù A sceptic might also say Labour will be keen to brand the problems once and for all as the Tories‚Äô fault. What of the new PM himself? It‚Äôs not lost on the public, or his political critics, that he has been willing to junk old promises, and indeed, to junk old colleagues if need be. His backers say it‚Äôs a sign of strength, and was a lesson he had to learn - ditching what one source described as ‚Äúnauseating‚Äù pleas for party unity for a clearer priority, the desire to win. It is no easier now to get to the bottom of what Sir Keir believes in than it was when I first sat down with him. Back then he was pitching for the leadership of his party, when his aim to get them back into power looked fanciful. He and his team had come up with the phrase ‚Äúmoral socialism‚Äù. Then, as now, it sounded like a slogan designed for a Guardian newspaper headline rather than something the public could latch on to. He told me he wanted to persuade people that Labour and politicians could be a ‚Äúforce for good and a force for change‚Äú. That‚Äôs a line that could feature in one of his many interviews or speeches four years later, where still, you might be searching for a grand ideological mantra. But perhaps to hunt for an ideology is to miss the point. He is not a factional politician who‚Äôs been in the trade, man and boy, not a product of student union elections, decades of party conferences, fevered debates about the purity of particular policies. For his backers, that arguable absence of an ideology is his huge advantage. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be the most normal PM we‚Äôve ever had,‚Äù says one insider. One minister tells me he belongs not to any faction but to the party. ‚ÄúHe is theirs,‚Äù the new minister says. Whether Sir Keir can make the public feel that kind of direct connection with him as a leader seems ambitious and highly uncertain. He sometimes apes Tony Blair, saying he‚Äôll return politics to serve the people through what he  terms national renewal. But despite the size of the majority, there is little sign at this moment that he could achieve that kind of incredible personal popularity the 1997 victor saw. It was Sir Keir‚Äôs belief that the modern electorate could be incredibly volatile that led him to have faith that he could turn the 2019 disaster round. The willingness of so many voters to change their minds has been Keir Starmer‚Äôs friend at this election but if that volatility is here to stay, it could become his foe. In time, and perhaps soon, Labour will start plotting privately how this term in office can be extended into what Starmer has already set out as his goal of a ‚Äúdecade of renewal‚Äú. Just before polling day, one insider joked: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never not thinking about winning the next election.‚Äù By any traditional measure, a majority on this scale would see a prime minister securely locked into two terms of office. But in 2024 that feels less certain. For now for Labour, there is a moment of profound celebration. No more the impotence of opposition. No more the pain of losing yet again. No more ‚Äúface of thunder‚Äù for the new prime minister, or the frustration of being irrelevant. As we saw in Downing Street yesterday, after all the waiting, he can allow himself a smile.

dBHtLY2sY3koupz,The Motley Fool,bing,Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD): How to Buy,https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/etfs/how-to-invest-in-schd-etf/,2024-07-05 22:06,2024-07-05 22:23,CVX,,"Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD  -0.21%) empowers anyone to invest in the wealth-creating capabilities of dividend stocks. Over the last 50 years, dividend payers have delivered a higher average annualized total return than the equal-weighted S&P 500 index (9.2% versus 7.7%), with less volatility than the broader market. Companies with a history of increasing their dividends have delivered even higher total returns (10.2% annualized).This exchange-traded fund (ETF) focuses on companies with solid track records of consistently paying dividends, most of which routinely increase their payouts. The fund is an excellent option for investors seeking to generate passive income while also realizing some stock price appreciation as the underlying companies grow in value.Definition IconExchange-Traded Fund (ETF)An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, allows investors to buy many stocks or bonds at once.Here's everything you need to know about investing in the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF.What is it?What is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF?The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF enables you to invest in 100 of the best dividend-paying stocks through a single fund. The ETF aims to closely track the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. The index measures the performance of high-dividend-yielding stocks that trade in the U.S. These companies consistently pay dividends and have fundamentally stronger financial metrics than their peers.How to buyHow to buy the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETFAnyone with a brokerage account can buy the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF. The dividend-focused fund trades on a major stock exchange, allowing you to purchase shares even if you don't have an account with Charles Schwab (SCHW  -1.25%). Here's a four-step guide to show you how to invest in ETFs.Step 1: Open a brokerage accountYou'll have to open and fund a brokerage account before buying shares of any ETF. If you need to open one, here are some of the best-rated brokers and trading platforms. Take your time researching the brokers to find the best one for you.Since this is a Schwab-sponsored ETF, include Charles Schwab in your research to see whether it might be a good broker for your situation. You'll also want to select a broker that allows you to buy and sell ETFs sponsored by Schwab.Step 2: Figure out your budgetBefore making your first trade, you'll need to determine a budget for how much money you want to invest. You'll then want to figure out how to allocate that money. The Motley Fool's investing philosophy recommends building a diversified portfolio of 25 or more stocks you plan to hold for at least five years.So, if you have $10,000, you'd want to invest about $400 across 25 different holdings. However, ETFs like the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF offer instant diversification (it holds 100 companies across nearly all stock market sectors). Given that built-in diversification, you could allocate much more of your portfolio to this ETF.Step 3: Do your researchYou need to thoroughly research any potential investment before committing your money. When analyzing an ETF, you should review its strategy, holdings, expense ratio, and historical performance and compare it to the best ETFs to buy.Definition IconExpense RatioA percentage of mutual fund or ETF assets deducted annually to cover management, operational, and administrative costs.Step 4: Place an orderOnce you've opened and funded a brokerage account, set your investing budget, and researched the investment, it's time to buy shares. The process is relatively straightforward. Go to your brokerage account's order page and fill out all the relevant information, including:The number of shares you want to buy or the amount you want to invest to purchase fractional shares.The stock ticker (SCHD for Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF).Whether you want to place a limit order or a market order. The Motley Fool recommends using a market order because it guarantees you buy shares immediately at market price.Once you complete the order page, click to submit your trade and add the high-quality dividend ETF to your portfolio.Image source: Getty Images.HoldingsHoldings of the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETFThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is a passively managed fund that mirrors the holdings of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. The index tracks roughly 100 dividend stocks known for consistently paying dividends backed by high-quality financial profiles. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF had 103 holdings in mid-2024, led by:Cisco Systems (CSCO  -0.09%): 4.1% of the fund's holdings.Home Depot (HD  0.28%): 4.1%.Texas Instruments (TXN  -0.07%): 4%Chevron (CVX  -1.53%): 4%.Amgen (AMGN  0.48%): 4%.The fund's top 10 holdings account for about 40% of its net assets. The ETF offers fairly broad diversification across stock market sectors:Financials: 17.4% of the portfolio's valueHealth Care: 15.7%Consumer Staples: 13.9%Industrials: 13.5%Energy: 12.8%Consumer Discretionary: 10.1%Information Technology: 8.7%Communication Services: 4.7%Materials: 3.1%Utilities: 0.03%Should I invest?Should I invest in the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF?Investing is a very personal venture. Not every stock or fund will be right for your situation. With that in mind, here are some reasons you might want to invest in the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF:You want to collect passive income.You'd like to earn a higher income yield than you can get from an S&P 500 index fund.You want to invest in a diversified portfolio of high-quality, higher-yielding dividend stocks.You don't want to be an active stock picker and manage a portfolio of dividend stocks.You're willing to exchange the potential for lower total returns for higher income and less volatility.On the other hand, here are some reasons the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF might not be the best ETF to buy for you:You're seeking a more growth-focused investment.You want a fixed income stream.You want an even higher income yield.You'd prefer to invest directly in dividend stocks.You already own a lot of dividend stocks.DividendsDoes the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF pay a dividend?Yes, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF pays a dividend. In mid-2024, the fund had a trailing-12-month dividend yield of 3.4%, more than double the S&P 500's dividend yield (around 1.3%). The higher dividend yield enables investors to collect more dividend income each year, providing them with a higher base return.The fund distributes dividend income to investors each quarter. The payments rise and fall based on the dividend income generated by the fund's portfolio, less its expense ratio. While the payments tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, they have steadily risen over the years as the companies in the fund have increased their dividends:Image source: Ychart.Expense ratioWhat is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF's expense ratio?ETF sponsors like Schwab charge fees known as expense ratios to manage funds on behalf of their investors. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has a 0.06% ETF expense ratio. That's a very low expense ratio for a passively managed ETF; the industry average is about 0.16%.Definition IconETF Expense RatioAnnual fee as a percentage of assets that an Exchange-Traded Fund charges investors for management and operational costs.For example, a $10,000 investment in the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF would incur $6 in management fees each year, about $10 less than other passively managed funds. The fund's lower expense ratio enables investors to keep more of the dividend income generated by the ETF's holdings. Although it might not seem like much at first, it adds up over time.Historical recordHistorical performance of the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETFDividend stocks tend to deliver solid returns over the long term.

However, while it has outperformed its benchmark, the fund has underperformed compared to the S&P 500 (15% annualized total return over the last five years and 12.9% during the past decade).Even though the fund has lagged behind the broader market, it provides investors with more income and lower-volatility returns.

2jcjBekxS2jtN95,CNN,bing,The UK used to be a European tourism hot spot. Here‚Äôs how it all went wrong,https://www.cnn.com/travel/uk-tourism-drop-visitor-numbers-election/index.html,2024-07-06 01:05,2024-07-06 01:14,V,,"CNN        ¬†‚Äî¬†                It‚Äôs hardly a great tourism slogan.                ‚ÄúBritain is grinding to a halt‚Äù was the verdict of the UK‚Äôs Labour Party on the country they hoped to govern, as they were setting out their case for election in June.                On July 4, they won by a landslide, promising change. As residents wonder what to expect day-to-day, those abroad might wonder what it means for their travel plans. Because one industry that could do with a change is tourism.                Since time immemorial, visitors have flocked to the UK. Its heritage and cultural sites have traditionally made it one of the jewels in Europe‚Äôs crown.                Yet while visitor numbers are up across the board on the continent ‚Äì nearly all EU member states saw numbers rise in 2023 year-on-year ‚Äì the UK has not yet caught up with pre-pandemic numbers.                Nearly 41 million overseas residents visited the UK in 2019. In 2023, 37.68 million entered ‚Äì a drop of 7.3%.                Compare that with Italy, which set a new record for arrivals numbers in 2023. Only Luxembourg saw a drop of 0.1% fewer tourists.                What‚Äôs more, international visitors applying for a tourist visa were down by 19% on pre-pandemic numbers.                The slow recovery coincides with tourism-allied hiccups. Regular strikes have been hampering transport. ‚ÄúRail cancelations are at record levels,‚Äù according to the new government in its pre-election manifesto.                The UK has a glorious coastline, but in recent years many beaches are increasingly polluted by sewage. Tax-free shopping for tourists has been axed, and EU visitors now need a passport to visit, which most don‚Äôt have.                And in 2024, the rhetoric around safety in the capital has been ramped up. In February, then prime minister Rishi Sunak suggested the country was descending into ‚Äúmob rule.‚Äù He also flagged a 20% rise in knife crime in London in May.                His comments were political, made while campaigning for local elections. Yet few listening from abroad would have noted the context.                So what‚Äôs gone wrong for the UK ‚Äì and can the incoming government turn it around? Labour‚Äôs pre-election manifesto, in which the party outlined its plans for the country, pretty much ignored the tourism industry. But it didn‚Äôt mince its words when describing the problems.                ‚ÄúBritain is grinding to a halt,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúRail cancelations are at record levels‚Ä¶ Conservative chaos has seen major projects abandoned, decades-long delays‚Ä¶ and our infrastructure crumbling.‚Äù                The party has promised to ‚Äúmodernize‚Äù UK transport infrastructure, ‚Äúrebuilding Britain.‚Äù The railways will be brought under public ownership. Those traveling by car will be pleased to know that Labour also pledged to repair potholes.                However none of this will be quick. Labour‚Äôs infrastructure overhaul is based on a 10-year plan.        Shifting prioritiesItaly has seen record visitor numbers, while the UK struggles to regain its pre-pandemic figures.JC Milhet/Hans Lucas/AFP/Getty Images            Is the UK really doing that badly or have travel trends shifted, post-pandemic? For Tom Jenkins, CEO of the European Tourism Organisation, it‚Äôs the latter. ‚ÄúI think the UK is doing perfectly well but we‚Äôll see more people going to [continental] Europe,‚Äù he says of 2024, adding that there‚Äôs ‚Äúallegedly a slight plateau of American demand for the UK.‚Äù                Patricia Yates, CEO of VisitBritain, disagrees, saying that American visitors have ‚Äúdriven our recovery since the pandemic.‚Äù Kayla Zeigner, owner of travel agency Destination Europe, says she is booking ever-more trips to the UK.                But for Marcy Zyonse, owner of Live The Dream Travel, a luxury vacations company, the UK has been hit by changing post-pandemic travel trends. ‚ÄúThe appetite for epic, culturally immersive travel has been so strong in the past couple of years,‚Äù she says.                ‚ÄúPeople were starved for that. In the US, we didn‚Äôt go beyond the Caribbean for a couple of years, so people are looking to do that Greece or Italy trip. We‚Äôve missed out on two or three years of travel, and I think the UK is too low down on the list.‚Äù English-speakers want a more exotic experience, she says ‚Äì starting with a foreign language.                After all, the UK is known for history, culture and the royals ‚Äì all of which will be around next year. It‚Äôs easier to prioritize that for a much-needed Mediterranean break.

Like every export industry, we have to pitch ‚Äì to tell people why they should come now. The balance of being a history and heritage destination is that it was there 10 years ago and will be there in 10 years.‚Äù                There‚Äôs also a hangover from the pandemic, when UK travel rules were particularly chaotic, say experts. Destinations that opened early got visitors raving about their first post-lockdown trips ‚Äì which had a knock-on effect.                ‚ÄúCurrent hotspots are destinations that opened early in 2021 to American tourists, which created a huge surge in demand,‚Äù says Zeigler.                Zyonse agrees. ‚ÄúYou guys in the UK were behind, and people lost confidence. People booking in 2021 for 2022 didn‚Äôt book the UK, and the effect snowballed. Social media has driven people to those places [that opened up earlier].‚Äù        Making Britain ‚Äògreat‚Äô againThe UK should promote iconic outdoor destinations such as the Lake District, says Zyonse.Owen Humphreys/PA Images/Getty Images            So what‚Äôs to be done? For Yates, the new government could use tourism as an economy-booster ‚Äì to the tune of 7% growth every year, she says, according to VisitBritain‚Äôs projections.                ‚ÄúThe strength of tourism is that you can dial up quickly ‚Äì we don‚Äôt need to build lots of infrastructure,‚Äù she says.                ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a case of promoting the right places at the right time to the right customers.‚Äù                Promotion is tricky in itself. The outgoing Conservative government was infamous for its ‚Äúausterity‚Äù cuts to public spending. In evidence to parliament in March 2024, VisitBritain revealed that its marketing budget was around ‚Äú¬£18 million ($23 million) annually, compared to over 80 euros million ($85.5 million) for Ireland.‚Äù                Back in November 2021, Yates told CNN that VisitBritain didn‚Äôt know what its budget would be from March 2022.                Today, she explains, it has a ¬£19.8 million core budget, and gets around the same amount from another government campaign. That‚Äôs still around half of Ireland‚Äôs budget ‚Äì so private-sector funding is used to boost it.                ‚ÄúWe know that for every ¬£1 invested we get ¬£15 spent by tourists ‚Äì a slice goes to the treasury, and money goes directly from international visitors into the economy. It‚Äôs a win-win,‚Äù she says.                But she‚Äôs keen for the new government to help take things further.                ‚ÄúTourism delivers over three million jobs, around 10% of the economy,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúTo have a real growth plan, we have to make a statement about Britain overseas that will drive visitors and investment.‚Äù        Welcoming visitorsNew Prime Minister Keir Starmer needs to make the UK appear more welcoming, says VisitBritain's Yates.Phil Noble/Reuters            Not many tourists will have cared about political instability ‚Äì as Zeigler says, ‚ÄúAmericans are dealing with our own political chaos.‚Äù But Yates says that what does cut through is ‚Äúthe message of welcome.‚Äù    Stay in Paris and you'll pay up to $5.50 per person per night in city tax.Alexander Spatari/Moment RF/Getty ImagesRelated articleEurope delays travel entry charges until 2025            ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hugely important as a driver for international visitors,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSometimes Britain has done that well, like during the London Olympics. Sometimes we don‚Äôt score as well. We need to look at how we position Britain as a welcoming destination, and how we look at borders and visas.‚Äù                In the 2023 Anholt-Ipsos Nation Brands Index, which ranks 60 nations on a range of attributes, the UK received its lowest ever rating for ‚ÄúWelcome.‚Äù Its rankings for ‚ÄúCulture‚Äù and ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù also dropped, though overall it rose two places to fourth position.                A visa for a Chinese visitor to the UK lasts a year, but costs the same about as a 10-year visa to the US, she says. Marcus Lee, CEO of China Travel Online says that visa efficiency is one of the top three drivers for Chinese tourists.                Visitors from the Gulf states have increased since the UK introduced a speedy ‚Äúelectronic travel authorization‚Äù scheme to fast-track their applications, says Yates. The scheme was due to expand to Europe and US markets ‚Äì it will now be up to the Labour government to do so.                Meanwhile the self-styled ‚Äúhostile environment‚Äù towards immigration of the last government hasn‚Äôt helped either. ‚ÄúFor tourism, we want an efficient and effective border, but we do want people to come,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe need to think about language.‚Äù She says that people who visit the UK on vacation are 18% more likely to invest in the country ‚Äì and investment is something the new government will be looking for.        Brexit side effectsThe UK has a stunning coastline - yet fewer visitors are coming to see it.Matt Cardy/Getty Images            As a result of Brexit, in 2021 the UK government abolished tax-free shopping for non-EU citizens. It means the UK is now the only European country not offering tax-free shopping to visitors from outside the continent.                Data from London retail promoter New West End Company in February showed that although visitor numbers in 2023 to the area were just 4% below 2019 levels, spending was down 19%. Visitors from the Gulf states ‚Äì some of the wealthiest tourists to grace the UK ‚Äì were up 20% on 2019 figures, yet they only spent 10% more.                The pattern was repeated with tourists from across the globe. US tourists were up 8% but spent 14% less. In Italy and Spain, however, US spending was up by 143% and 179% respectively.                ‚ÄúThe impact of losing tax-free shopping is clear to see,‚Äù says Dee Corsi, chief executive of the NWEC. ‚ÄúWhile the UK strives to return to pre-pandemic levels of travel and spend, continental Europe‚Äôs recovery continues at pace.                ‚ÄúWhilst the likes of Italy and France are actively leveraging tax-free shopping as a driver of growth, British businesses continue to trade at a disadvantage. With domestic spend remaining squeezed, a continued decline of tourist spending will have a knock-on effect on employment rates, inward investment, and supply chains across the nation.‚Äù                She calls bringing back tax-free shopping a ‚Äúrare, golden opportunity for the government to‚Ä¶ inject a shot of growth back into the economy, with a tried-and-tested scheme and a captive audience.‚Äù                ‚ÄúWe would urge the new government to grasp this opportunity with both hands,‚Äù she adds.                Meanwhile, EU citizens now need a passport to visit the UK, where pre-Brexit they could cross the border with their ID cards. In 2021, Jenkins told CNN that three-quarters of Europeans don‚Äôt have passports.                Then there are clouds on the horizon regarding getting in and out. When the new ETIAS scheme launches, every traveler entering the Schengen area for the first time will need their biometric data captured. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be time consuming initally,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs evidence that really bad entry systems deter people.‚Äù        ‚ÄôBridgerton‚Äô to the rescue?Visitors love the UK's pomp and circumstance, and the royals, as King Charles' coronation showed.John Sibley/Reuters            So what can be done? For Zyonse, VisitBritain should spend that marketing budget on attracting influencers and travel advisors to lesser-known destinations. A self-declared lover of the UK, who calls London ‚Äúa better version of New York,‚Äù she says that the post-pandemic drive for more ‚Äúepic‚Äù adventures calls for a different approach. Timelapse videos of an elevator going up London‚Äôs Shard skyscraper, or something more wild in the Lake District, could attract social media likes, she says.

For Yates, the new government offers a chance to grow the industry. But she warns that the UK needs to revamp its international reputation, wishing for it ‚Äúto be seen internationally as a welcoming, culturally diverse, vibrant country that people want to visit, send their kids to school and invest in.‚Äù                With the new government promising change from day one, it might not be long until she sees her dreams coming true.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

fQ0T0TLmZaBM6pd,Seeking Alpha,bing,Understanding Cloud Computing Investment Opportunities,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702670-understanding-cloud-computing-investment-opportunities,2024-07-06 01:36,2024-07-06 01:49,AMZN,,"Olemedia Cloud Computing Background The momentum surrounding AI that was unleashed in 2023 continues to grow, and one thing we have learned is that cloud infrastructure is a critical part of the growth in AI. According to Microsoft (MSFT), cloud computing is: √¢¬Ä¬úThe delivery of computing services√¢¬Ä¬îincluding servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence√¢¬Ä¬îover the internet (√¢¬Ä¬úthe cloud√¢¬Ä¬ù) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.√¢¬Ä¬ù The benefits of cloud computing to companies include cost savings, on-demand access to computing power, economies of scale, performance tied to a network of data centers with state-of-the-art hardware, security, and disaster recovery. The growth outlook for cloud computing is bright and is estimated at 16.5% per year through 2032[1]. So how does an investor gain exposure to companies focused on this space? The answer is not as clear as you might think. Companies involved in cloud computing can be broken into two categories. There are firms that have most of their revenue tied to cloud related services, which we refer to as √¢¬Ä¬úpure plays.√¢¬Ä¬ù Equinix, Inc. (EQIX) (a cloud data center) and Arista Networks (ANET) (cloud networking software) are examples of such pure plays, as they each have 100% of their revenue tied to cloud computing. The other category is large, technology-based firms with a cloud related product line(s) that in total are less than 50% of revenue. For example, Cloud Computing services represent roughly 38% and 16% of revenue for Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN), respectively. The distinction between pure plays and the large, diversified tech players is important when evaluating the holdings of an ETF. When you look across the product lines of the S&P 500, cloud computing represents just under 5% of the total weight in the index. However, when the exposure is measured by a company√¢¬Ä¬ôs primary business line, the weight in the index is less than 1%. This highlights much of the exposure to cloud computing is held as secondary and tertiary business lines of large companies, with relatively little weight allocated to pure play cloud computing companies. This fact makes it difficult to construct a diversified cloud computing portfolio focusing on pure play companies alone. To illustrate this point, in Exhibit 1, we breakdown the companies in the Syntax 500 (US large cap) and Syntax 3000 (US total market) universes by the percentage of their revenue attributable to cloud computing. Exhibit 1: Distribution of Cloud Computing Revenue % in the Syntax 500 and Syntax 3000 Universes   Number of companies as of March 31, 2024. (Source: Syntax Data) The results show:  In the Syntax 500, just one third of the 30 companies with any exposure to cloud computing have 75% or more of their revenue tied to the cloud, while in the Syntax 3000 the number is about 40%. In both universes, about half have a majority of their revenue from cloud computing, implying the other half of revenue is not related to the cloud. Increasing the universe from the Syntax 500 to Syntax 3000 roughly doubles the number of companies with any cloud computing exposure. Increasing the universe from the Syntax 500 to Syntax 3000 roughly doubles the number of companies with any cloud computing exposure.  A takeaway from this analysis is that there is a limited universe of pure play companies to choose from, and if you would like exposure to the various components of cloud computing, you will need to invest in both pure play and diversified large companies. Analyzing The Cloud Computing ETF Market A takeaway from this analysis is that there is a limited universe of pure play companies to choose from, and if you would like exposure to the various components of cloud computing, you will need to invest in both pure play and diversified large companies. Exhibit 2: Syntax Cloud Computing Lens Components   Source: Syntax Data The results of our screen are shown in Exhibit 3. Exhibit 3: ETFs With Meaningful Cloud Computing Exposure     Highlights from the exhibit include:  The ETFs shown have Cloud Computing exposure ranging from 18% to 42%. The First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index Fund at $3 billion in assets is the largest ETF by a wide margin. The Global X Cloud Computing ETF and the Pacer Data and Infrastructure Real Estate ETF have meaningful assets at $472 million and $425 million, respectively. The ETFs have varied themes referenced in their names. Four ETFs have √¢¬Ä¬úCloud Computing√¢¬Ä¬ù or √¢¬Ä¬úCloud√¢¬Ä¬ù in their name; other wording includes √¢¬Ä¬úDigital Infrastructure,√¢¬Ä¬ù √¢¬Ä¬úData Center,√¢¬Ä¬ù and √¢¬Ä¬úBig Data.√¢¬Ä¬ù  To better assess what the focus of the cloud computing exposure is in each of these ETFs, we expanded our analysis in Exhibit 4 to show the six components that comprise our Cloud Computing Lens. This table is sorted by the Total Cloud Computing exposure from highest to lowest. Exhibit 4: Exposure To Cloud Computing Components     The ETFs have varying exposures to cloud computing in total and its components.  The largest weight to cloud computing is 42%, reinforcing the fact there are limited pure play opportunities. Six of the ETFs have exposure to Data Centers, including the top four ETFs by concentration weight. Note that many of these companies are organized as REITs and are typically classified in the Real Estate sector. Exposure to Cloud Services and Cloud Hardware is found in most of the ETFs. The exposure to Software (Cloud and Database Software combined) is roughly 50% or more in five of the ten ETFs. Diversification levels vary within the ETFs: four ETFs are invested in five categories of the six components within the Cloud Computing Lens, three are invested in four categories.  Conclusions The cloud computing investment landscape is a complicated and nuanced space. Based on Syntax√¢¬Ä¬ôs product line classification data, we can cultivate a better understanding of the opportunities provided by cloud computing ETFs. We identified the top 10 ETFs with meaningful allocations to this space and showed:  The ETFs analyzed covered a variety of named themes in their titles, including √¢¬Ä¬úCloud Computing,√¢¬Ä¬ù √¢¬Ä¬úDigital Infrastructure,√¢¬Ä¬ù √¢¬Ä¬úBig Data√¢¬Ä¬ù and √¢¬Ä¬úGenerative AI.√¢¬Ä¬ù As many cloud computing companies are not pure plays, it is difficult to construct a portfolio with substantial exposure to cloud computing [PK1]. However, there are three ETFs with between 40% - 42% of their assets in Cloud Computing per our analysis. There are four ETFs with over $100 million in assets, with the largest having roughly $3 billion in assets.  We highlighted how the market is split between companies that can be considered pure plays and firms where cloud computing business lines are a minority of their revenue. EFT issuers may choose to invest in large tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon to gain exposure to the Cloud Services segment of the market, which makes sense. The challenge is, for example, Cloud Services represent just 16% of Amazon√¢¬Ä¬ôs total revenue, which means the ETF also has exposure to the 84% of Amazon√¢¬Ä¬ôs revenue tied to their e-commerce and other business lines. This is one of the reasons why most of the 10 ETFs we analyzed total exposure to our Cloud Computing Lens was in the range of roughly 25%-45%. The takeaway here is that ETFs focused on the full range of cloud computing opportunities will be a combination of cloud computing and other technologies. We believe this underscores the need to move beyond the name of the ETF and focus on its holdings at the product line level. Additionally, for investors that have significant exposure to the S&P 500, they need to be aware of whether they may be doubling up on the concentration risk in certain large tech companies. Investors should realize as well that there is some subjectivity associated with defining an investment category or theme such as cloud computing based on the nuances above. Individuals and firms will have different perspectives, so it is difficult to say one view is better than another. What we do believe, however, is when investing in a theme, it should be clearly defined. It also reinforces the need to look beyond sectors: cloud computing is an amalgamation of different business lines that cut across sectors, hence the need to identify and quantity these exposures as done using our Cloud Computing Lens.

dMEUp1Uuns5h86o,Seeking Alpha,bing,DTD: Heavier Weight On Mega-Cap IT Presents Multiple Risks,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702683-dtd-heavier-weight-on-mega-cap-it-presents-multiple-risks,2024-07-06 03:47,2024-07-06 04:06,AAPL,,"Max Zolotukhin Investment Thesis WisdomTree U.S. Total Dividend Fund (NYSEARCA:DTD) warrants a hold rating due to multiple risk factors for the fund. While DTD has seen strong performance compared to peers, comparable ETFs have seen roughly the same capital appreciation with a higher dividend yields and lower expense ratios. Additionally, DTD is heavy on mega-cap information technology companies which has resulted in a relatively high valuation for the fund with increased risk of correction and volatility. Fund Overview and Compared ETFs DTD is a passively managed fund that seeks to track the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Index. This index is dividend weighted but does not necessarily put the greatest weight in the highest dividend paying companies. With its inception in 2006, the fund has 827 holdings and $1.23B in AUM. DTD is heaviest in the information technology sector at 18.89%, followed by financials (18.46%) and consumer staples (11.86%). DTD includes predominantly (91.87% weight) on large cap, U.S. holdings. While numerous dividend ETFs exist, other popular dividend funds examined for comparison purposes are Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM), and Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (DIVO). In contrast to DTD, SCHD has only 8.7% weight on information technology. VYM seeks to capture companies forecasted to produce above average dividend yields. VYM is the largest fund compared with over $67B in AUM. DIVO also has lower weight in information technology and is the least diversified ETF compared with only 36 holdings. Comparing DTD and Peers: Performance, Fees, and Dividend Yields The newest fund compared, DIVO, was created in 2016. Therefore a 5-year lookback was used for comparing funds. DTD√¢¬Ä¬ôs average annual 5-year return was 11.85%. By comparison, SCHD has a 5-year annualized return of 13.36% and DIVO has an annualized 5-year return of 11.19%. VYM saw the weakest performance with a 5-year average annual return of 9.76%. Of course, this is only considering the share price of each fund. I will discuss the combined impact of dividend yields and expense ratios later which must also be considered. Despite solid performance, all funds have underperformed the S&P 500 Index over the past five years which has seen a 5-year average annual return of roughly 15%.   5-Year Total Price Return: DTD and Peer Dividend-Focused Funds (Seeking Alpha) DTD√¢¬Ä¬ôs fees are lower than DIVO√¢¬Ä¬ôs at 0.28%.

A key factor is DTD√¢¬Ä¬ôs relatively heavy weight on the information technology sector. This difference has only exacerbated in the past few months. The second consideration is that DTD lags peers when also considering dividend yield and expense ratio in addition to share price performance. Both these considerations are discussed further below. Concern #1: Heavy on IT Sector The first potential disadvantage for DTD is its weight on the information technology sector. I have followed DTD since April this year and noted that back then the fund was heaviest in the financial sector at 18.25%, followed by information technology (17.45%) and consumer staples (12.11%). Currently, DTD has almost 19% in the IT sector. Comparatively, SCHD and VYM hold only 8.7% and 10.1% weight in IT respectively. In recent years, this heavier weight has served DTD well. The IT sector has seen over 40% return over the past year with a 5-year return of 207%. Meanwhile, the broader S&P 500 Index has yielded a 24% one-year return and 85% five-year return. This five-year difference is depicted below.   Comparative Performance of IT Sector vs. S&P 500 Index (Yahoo Finance) However, this disparity in performance has resulted in high P/E for several top mega-cap, big tech holdings. Over the trailing twelve months, price-to-earnings ratios for the largest tech companies by market cap have reached high points. Averaging the P/E ratios for the top five holdings for DTD, SCHD, and VYM, we see a significantly higher valuation for DTD√¢¬Ä¬ôs top holdings, driven by the IT sector's recent performance.   DTD (weight) P/E Ratio SCHD (weight) P/E Ratio VYM (weight) P/E Ratio   MSFT (3.34%) 39.93 CSCO (4.11%) 15.90 JPM (3.53%) 12.60   AAPL (3.31%) 34.51 HD (4.05%) 22.36 AVGO (3.45%) 76.03   JPM (2.97%) 12.60 TXN (4.04%) 30.99 XOM (3.21%) 14.09   AVGO (2.64%) 76.03 CVX (4.04%) 14.43 PG (2.34%) 26.79   XOM (2.60%) 14.09 AMGN (4.04%) 44.15 JNJ (2.13%) 21.48   Average 35.43 Average 25.57 Average 30.20   Click to enlarge Source: Multiple, compiled by author on 5 Jul 24 Examining historic trends, there is reason to have concern about the IT sector, dominated by mega-cap growth companies. Earlier this year, the Russell 1000 Growth Index saw a P/E ratio 36% above its average seen since 2000. By comparison, the Russell 2000 Value Index had a P/E 26% below its average since 2000. Therefore, DTD√¢¬Ä¬ôs emphasis on the IT sector with a high P/E for top holdings presents a liability for the fund compared to peers. Concern #2: Incorporating Expense Ratios and Dividend Yields The second key area for concern is DTD√¢¬Ä¬ôs expense ratio and lower dividend yield compared to peers. While its 0.28% expense ratio is lower than DIVO√¢¬Ä¬ôs, it is notably more expensive than SCHD and VYM. This 0.22% difference can add up over the long run. Additionally, DTD has a lower dividend yield than both SCHD and VYM. This combined effect of average return, expense ratio, and dividend yield can be listed in the table below. Assuming a constant dividend yield over the past five years, DTD lags both SCHD and DIVO.     DTD SCHD VYM DIVO   5-year Average Annual Return 11.85% 13.36% 9.76% 11.19%   Expense Ratio 0.28% 0.06% 0.06% 0.56%   Dividend Yield 2.24% 3.67% 3.00% 4.58%   Average Total Return with Dividends minus Expenses 13.81% 16.97% 12.70% 15.21%   Click to enlarge Source: Multiple, compiled by author, 5 Jul 24 We can then conclude that while DTD has strong 5-year performance, its low dividend yield sets the fund behind other comparable ETFs. Given DTD√¢¬Ä¬ôs heavier information technology focus, an investor would need to see stronger capital appreciation to make up for its lower dividend yield. While this has been true over the past five years, mega-cap IT√¢¬Ä¬ôs high valuation is at risk of a correction as previously discussed. Current Valuation As a result of DTD√¢¬Ä¬ôs relatively high concentration in the information technology sector, the fund has seen the strongest performance over the past year at 13.9%. However, this has also driven its valuation to be relatively high compared to peer funds. At 19.90, DTD has the highest price-to-earnings ratio.   One Year Performance: DTD and Compared Dividend ETFs (Seeking Alpha) Looking forward, it appears that DTD is at risk for the greatest correction in the event of a downturn. While the fund has a lower P/E than the broader market, as measured by the S&P 500, its tech-focus represents a liability for the fund. Based on the below P/E and P/B ratios, I see significant risk in DTD√¢¬Ä¬ôs ability to sustain its growth. Given its lagging dividend yield and higher expenses than SCHD and VYM, a correction in the IT sector will prove highly problematic for DTD. Valuation Metrics for DTD and Peer Competitors     DTD SCHD VYM DIVO   P/E ratio 19.90 16.21 18.50 15.85   P/B ratio 3.46 3.10 2.60 3.64   Click to enlarge Source: Compiled by Author from Multiple Sources, 5 Jul 24 Risks to Investors DTD√¢¬Ä¬ôs performance comparative to peers likely hinges on the performance of mega-cap IT. Since May 1, 2024, the information technology sector√¢¬Ä¬ôs forward price-to-earnings ratio has increased 19% from 26 to 31. Therefore, there is risk that IT valuations are increasing at a rate greater than their own earnings growth. Of course, a significant risk to my own thesis is that a correction back to historic average does not occur and large IT such as Microsoft, Apple, and NVIDIA continue to far exceed the rest of the market. One key variable is the expected reduction in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. As we saw since 2008, low interest rates have a strong fueling effect to large-cap growth companies. A reduction of the federal funds rate to 1.75% to 2.00% by the end of 2026 could mean that DTD outshines peer dividend ETFs, despite its high valuation. Concluding Summary  DTD has demonstrated a historic trend of solid performance with a dividend yield that beats the S&P 500 Index. However, the fund has gravitated towards mega-cap, IT companies in its top holdings which has resulted in a high valuation for the fund. As an alternative, SCHD and VYM have higher dividend yields, lower expense ratios, and more attractive valuations due to their lower IT weight. Looking back 20 years, large cap growth has become overvalued while small cap value has become undervalued. A return to historic averages will drive DTD to underperform comparable dividend-producing funds.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

izr0iMuowvBShIA,Seeking Alpha,google,"IBM Stock: Quantum Computing, Growth And Dividends (NYSE:IBM)",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702694-ibm-quantum-computing-growth-and-dividends,2024-07-06 04:40,2024-07-06 04:49,IBM,,"Mrkit99/iStock Editorial via Getty Images How long has it been since we've seen growth from IBM? International Business Machines (IBM) is a stock I've been in for as long as I have been investing, a little over a decade. I stubbornly followed Warren Buffett into the stock when Ginni Rometty was serving as CEO and their massive buyback program helped give IBM the appearance that they were generating huge returns on equity as the share count plummeted. Data by YCharts Pretty much an entire decade-plus was spent on buying back shares as IBM thought they had such an infallible, ""sticky"" business that would no longer need the massive research and development spend that the competition was expensing and hurting their own GAAP profits. Sacrificing today for a brighter tomorrow is the piston that drove the new hyper-scaler Mag 7 companies, IBM, fell behind. Data by YCharts As an example, the research and development trend line for IBM has been flat since the early 90s. On the other hand, competition, using Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) as a proxy, was spending with fervor. This expensing was even a better idea during the ZIRP era as interest rates were so low that the FED was subsidizing these companies on their way to global domination. IBM was borrowing and doing buybacks. What they do IBM 2023 annual report Told through a story of numbers, the primary business is comprised of hybrid and cloud software solutions focused at enterprise level clients ringing in at 42.5% of revenue exposure, this is followed closely by IBM's consulting business at 32% and lastly, computing infrastructure at 23.5%. Top line growth rates have suffered since 2010 Data by YCharts If the above was an EKG meter, we'd be calling in the physician with the paddles. A steep drop in revenue since 2010 to say the least. However, zooming in on the last 3 years we IBM investors finally see hope, a glimmer of light, and some possible use cases for quantum computing that could be unlocked synergistically with current AI technologies. Data by YCharts Growth rate in price versus growth rates in top and bottom lines Data by YCharts We know that IBM's long-term story has been horrific, but on a 3-year basis, the stock is up 31.45% following the 3-year revenue trend lines closely. On a total return basis over the last three years being that IBM is a big dividend payer, the return has not been horrible. In fact, IBM has been able to beat the market during this short period since the uptick in growth commenced : Data by YCharts Quantum computing Stephen Shankland/CNET To get an idea of just how vastly different quantum computing is from what we are accustomed to, Stephen Shankland of CNET provides this beautiful close-up picture of what a quantum computer processor looks like. Science fiction at its finest with cyberpunk vibes giving the impression that computations are being made by pure energy and physics rather than on circuit boards and processors.  A lot of what we're looking at is apparently cooling technology with the actual processor below this latticework wire structure. While IBM is not the only company developing Quantum Computers [Google claims their QC is even ahead of IBM], they are the first commercial company credited with developing the technology on a large scale. Viability and use cases are still in their elementary phases. An elegant and succinct description of QCs from the same CNET article: Quantum computers rely on qubits to store and process data. Unlike regular computer bits, which can store either a zero or a one, qubits can store a combination of both through a concept called superposition. Another factor is entanglement, which links the states of two qubits even if they're separated. ibm.com/quantum/qiskit IBM does have a quantum computing offering. For those who are not computer scientists, myself certainly included, my understanding is that Qiskit cloud computing is designed for those companies trying to code and implement quantum computing software. Similar to AWS where you can take advantage of their servers to code and run your software, paying for time every instance you spin up a server in one of their data centers. Looking at the enormity of a quantum computer and imagining QC one day becoming a mainstream software coding medium, this will 100% have to be done only through cloud services such as IBM's offerings. Not only the size of these computers but the cooling requirements make it all but impossible for a company to own and operate one of these if they are not a multi-billion dollar organization. Excellent IBM presentations further elaborate on use cases for QC. Things like figuring out problems that have to do with the physics of quantum particles and small molecules could finally unlock new technologies in energy and biotech. Simulating nature and figuring out it's randomness which may actually operate under quantum physics laws that classical computers can not yet crack. Politicians have highlighted their government's worries around QC in it's abilities to crack encryption implemented by classical digital computing in things like encrypted payments and file sharing. The race to develop functional quantum computers is similar to the AI race around the world with many players working on their own hardware. IBM has the largest functioning quantum computer called Condor and has a leg up in the race. This begets further consulting revenue I don't care if you're an amazing business full of talented coders and familiar with all kinds of tech and coding languages [ IBM's Qiskit utilizes python as per one of their training videos], you are going to need IBM's training and consulting business. The prospect of revenue growth when it comes to new computing technologies both in utilization time and storage space is further compounded by the need for consultants to train your team. This is another catalyst for IBM's top-line growth.  IBM is also a traditional AI cloud competitor Some examples of IBM's AI cloud offerings contained within their 2023 annual report:    AI and hybrid cloud continue to drive value creation, allowing businesses to scale, increase productivity, and seize new market opportunities. IBM has built two powerful platforms to capitalize on the strong demand for both technologies: watsonx for AI, and Red Hat OpenShift for hybrid cloud. Watsonx is our comprehensive AI and data platform, built to deliver AI models and give our clients the ability to manage the entire lifecycle of AI for business, including the training, tuning, deployment, and ongoing governance of those models. Financial institutions like Citi, Bradesco, and NatWest are using watsonx to help increase productivity, improve code quality, and enhance customer experiences.  The company touts partnerships with AWS, Microsoft, and SAP regarding their AI ecosystem. In that sense, IBM should not be discounted as an old non-player in cloud computing. They have adapted and are certainly in the mix. Valuation The below basic valuation utilizes an owner earnings discount at the present value using the current risk-free rate of the 10-year Treasury. Warren Buffet argued that if we have a company with an owner earnings yield [ defined as net income adding back deprecation and amortization and subtracting CAPEX requirements] over the current risk-free rate and that yield could be expected to grow over time whereas the risk-free rate is static, then all else considered, that valuation is sufficient as long as the company is expected to grow. IBM was considered a bad investment in the last decade due to the lack of growth prospects. The only way to grow was to buy back shares drawing the ire of several critics including short seller Jim Chanos. Now that we see 3-year trailing growth on the top line and analyst estimates for top and bottom line growth through 2025, this could finally be the beginning of a turnaround: Seeking Alpha Below is the fair value estimate based on TTM owner earnings: All numbers TTM in millions courtesy of Seeking Alpha           Stock TTM Net Income Plus Depreciation and Amortization Minus CAPEX Owner Earnings Shares OE/Share   IBM 8155 4453 1184 11424 918.6 12.43   Click to enlarge Owner earnings yield: 7.1% Taking the owner earnings per share number and discounting it by the current risk-free rate of the 10-year treasury [4.5%] gets us to a fair value of $276.22. This valuation model only makes sense when compared to the current risk-free rate if the revenue and owner earnings trend lines continue to grow. If you feel that IBM has hit a new growth trajectory in these past few years, then the stock appears to be substantially undervalued.  The dividend Seeking Alpha At 3.77%, IBM has a really solid yield for a tech company that is operating in one of the hottest headline segments of the market, cloud computing. Buybacks have been sidelined which should preserve future capital for growth CAPEX and R&D. Seeking Alpha Interestingly enough, the yield is around its decade-long median. This stock was going nowhere for a long time and the yield continued to grow as IBM is a dividend aristocrat dedicated to sustaining and growing its dividend. 30-year investors in the stock now enjoy a yield on cost close to 50%. Inflation and compound interest can be a wonderful thing. For those that have stayed away from the name while they went on their buyback spree, we also now get to benefit from the massive shrinkage of shares outstanding from over 2 billion in the late 90s to under a billion shares today. Balance sheet Data by YCharts The one glaring negative to IBM besides the negative top-line growth rates is the balance sheet. This is certainly true when comparing the company to the upper echelon of the Fab 7 and is where IBM suffers. Having more long-term debt than cash and short-term investments shows that IBM has been horrible at generating the same level of free cash flow that the hyper-scalers had that spent massive amounts on R&D while IBM was buying back shares. They focused on revenue and cash flow while IBM focused on GAAP earnings. The lion's share of this LT debt was spent on the 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, still under previous CEO Rometty but championed by Krishna. Red Hat has been one of the growth engines for IBM since acquisition and needs to continue to be a top line growth engine after an acquisition that amounts to an equivalent 21% of IBM's current market cap at a previous purchase price of $34 Billion USD. Yes, the float on IBM has been greatly reduced, but the company has far less leeway in making mistakes than other tech companies do as their balance sheet is already highly leveraged.  Risks IBM operates in a highly competitive market with mostly exposure to enterprise clients. They spent a lot of years resting on their laurels and not putting enough money to work in R&D as they wanted to preserve their high appearance of EPS growth and return on equity, the very things that drew Warren Buffett into this value trap. The open source software Linux subscription acquisition, Red Hat, also needs to keep adding to the top line. Growth rates have been very good since the 2019 acquisition, but have been slowing. Finding another growth driver beyond Red Hat is important. The company has a lot of ground to make up and is already more leveraged than the competition in an unfavorable interest rate environment. Quantum computing is their ace on the hole but it has to start generating substantial revenue and growth to make this investment compelling. Summary CEO Arvind Krishna has been with IBM since 1990 and took over the reins as CEO in 2020. The previous CEO, Ginni Rometty did not have the same background at IBM as Krishna did who was a hands-on researcher at The Thomas J. Watson Center. When you have a computer science company, don't put a salesperson in charge, get a computer scientist.   The revenue turnaround coincides with his leadership. As he now joins the ranks of very talented Indian-American tech CEOs in this space which includes Satya Nadella at Microsoft (MSFT), Shantanu Narayen at Adobe (ADBE), and Sundar Pichai at Google, I am optimistic that IBM is finally pointed in the right direction.

ssWX8W2kgvyyJGi,The Motley Fool,google,Better Chip Stock: AMD vs. Micron,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/06/better-chip-stock-amd-vs-micron/,2024-07-06 05:10,2024-07-06 05:16,NVDA,,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 4.88%) and Micron Technologies (MU -3.81%) are both underdogs in their respective markets. AMD is the world's second-largest maker of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs after Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), respectively. Micron is the world's third-largest producer of DRAM chips and its fourth-largest supplier of NAND chips. Samsung and SK Hynix lead both the DRAM and NAND markets.Yet AMD and Micron both have unique competitive advantages.AMD, by outsourcing its production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, sells denser, cheaper, and more power-efficient CPUs than Intel. It also sells cheaper GPUs than Nvidia. Micron, which operates its own foundries, produces denser memory chips than its South Korean competitors.Image source: Getty Images.Those strengths enabled both chipmakers to weather tough macro, cyclical, and competitive headwinds. Over the past 10 years, AMD's stock price soared 3,770% as it gained ground against Intel in x86 CPUs, kept pace with Nvidia in discrete GPUs, and carved out a defensible niche with its custom APUs for gaming consoles.Micron's stock rallied more than 300% as the expansion of the mobile, data center, PC, and connected vehicle markets generated cyclical but steady demand for its DRAM and NAND chips. AMD has clearly been the more exciting play for growth-oriented investors, but is it still the better buy right now? Let's take a fresh look at both companies to decide.Both companies face cyclical headwindsIn 2023, AMD generated 29% of its revenue from its sales of Epyc CPUs and Instinct GPUs for data centers. It generated another 27% of its sales from gaming GPUs for PCs and custom APUs for consoles, 23% from its sales of embedded chips (including Xilinx's programmable chips), and the remaining 21% from x86 CPUs for PCs.AMD's revenue fell 4% for the year as its declining sales of PC and gaming chips offset its stronger sales of data center and embedded chips for the growing AI market. Its sales of PC CPUs and GPUs declined as fewer people upgraded their PCs following the industry's temporary growth spurt during the pandemic, and its sales of custom APUs slipped as Sony and Microsoft sold fewer consoles. Inflationary headwinds for consumer spending exacerbated that slowdown.As a result, AMD's adjusted gross margin shrank two percentage points to 50% in 2023 as its adjusted earnings plunged 24%. But for 2024, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 5% and 23%, respectively, as it ships more data center chips for the booming AI market and the PC and gaming markets stabilize. For 2025, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to increase 28% and 60%, respectively.In fiscal 2023 (which ended last August), Micron's revenue plummeted 49%, its adjusted gross margin turned negative, and it posted an adjusted net loss. Its sales of DRAM chips (71% of its top line) and NAND chips (27%) shriveled as PC shipments fizzled out and the 5G upgrade cycle for smartphones ended. The macro headwinds also drove its data customers to prioritize AI-oriented purchases of GPUs over new memory chips.But in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Micron's revenue surged 51% year over year as the PC and smartphone markets stabilized, and data centers upgraded their solid-state drives (SSDs) and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to process more AI tasks. Its adjusted gross margin and adjusted earnings also turned positive again.For the full year, analysts expect Micron's revenue to grow 50% with an adjusted profit. For fiscal 2025, they expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to increase by 54% and 676%, respectively, as a new growth cycle begins.But one stock seems to be the better valueAMD and Micron should both experience accelerating growth over the next two years as their core markets warm up again. However, AMD looks a bit pricey at 48 times forward earnings -- especially when Nvidia, which is growing faster with more exposure to the AI market -- has a forward multiple of 49. Micron trades at just 16 times forward earnings.AMD's valuations seem to be inflated by the market's high expectations for its Instinct GPUs -- which cost much less than Nvidia's H100 GPUs -- for the AI-driven data center market. But AMD only generates a sliver of its revenue from those chips and is highly exposed to the wobblier PC and gaming console markets.Investors also seem bullish on Micron's growth potential in the AI market -- but its cyclical recovery is clearer and it looks more reasonably valued. That's why I believe the memory chipmaker is a better buy than AMD right now.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

And in the vast majority of mocks, that player has also been the same.That theme stayed true to form this week when Ian Valentino of The 33rd Team released his way-too-early mock draft and had the Giants selecting ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî Georgia quarterback Carson Beck at No. 5 overall.An offer for Giants fans For the best local North Jersey news, sports, entertainment and culture coverage, subscribe to NorthJersey.com. $1 for 6 months The 2025 QB1 spot is certainly up for grabs. Right now, Carson Beck‚Äôs blend of accuracy, processing, and performance under pressure makes him the easiest of the bunch to project.He might not have the huge upside that allows him to fight off late bloomers with better traits, but he‚Äôs the surest bet we‚Äôve seen in the group.Our friend Jeff Risdon of Draft Wire wrote up an offseason breakdown of Beck and came away impressed. Here‚Äôs what he had to say:Overall I came away largely impressed with Beck. There‚Äôs a lot to work with athletically, and his arm strength and capable mobility are definitely appealing. Growth in the processing department, throwing touch, and an ability to adapt to new receivers will be major keys to Beck‚Äôs draft stock in the coming college season.Risdon did point out two things of note about Beck: He is not mobile and therefore would require a stout and stead offensive line, and he tends to force a lot of balls.Neither of those things mesh with the current roster construction of the Giants. In order to insert Beck and expect quality production, they‚Äôd need to fix two problems that have plagued them for more than a decade ‚Äî the offensive line and an abundance of talented skill position players.

KxWTQ8uQXzVljq3,Chicago Tribune,google,David McGrath: I built a family cabin as an investment in America,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/07/06/opinion-building-a-cabin-summer-vacation/,2024-07-06 06:03,2024-07-06 06:05,ARM,,"On an evening in April many years ago, I sat alone at a corner table in the Lakewood Cafe & Hotel in the northwestern Wisconsin town of Winter (current population: 331).  I was an English teacher at Chicago Vocational High School  at the time and was taking advantage of spring vacation to begin constructing a cabin on Blue Gill Lake 12 miles north of town. Famished after clearing trees from the lake lot, I ordered the Thursday night special of beef and gravy, mashed potatoes and red garden beets, to be washed down with a cold bottle of Leinenkugel red ale. But when I reached for the fork, I could not lift my arm.Panic.I tried to recollect whether pain in the right or left arm signals an oncoming heart attack (it‚Äôs usually the left). But I was only 37. Maybe the arm was just asleep.So I used my left arm to awkwardly lift the fork and feed myself, while worrying whether it was something serious.By the end of the meal, whether it was from eating food or from resting my elbow on the table, I was able, with concentrated effort, to raise the paralyzed arm before retiring to my rented room upstairs.My arm remained stiff, and I kept opening and closing my hand to keep it loose. But it turned out that I was basically OK after I learned from a truck driver for Winter Lumber the next day that I was suffering from HAVS, or hand-arm vibration syndrome, a common medical condition that numbs and immobilizes appendages. The affliction is common to loggers and construction workers who use chainsaws and jackhammers for a living.I was greatly relieved. But I was also oddly proud of the pain. A teacher and pencil pusher by trade, here I was able to play carpenter and lumberjack, wielding a chainsaw to cut down and cut up half a dozen red pine trees to prepare for my family cabin‚Äôs foundation.Where else but in America could a man with little experience, and even less money, acquire a waterfront lot in the North Woods, where he could design and build a home by himself?I thought about that the next day, after my arm had mostly recovered, while I set about digging 24 holes, 4 feet deep, in which to sink the 6-by-6 treated lumber posts that would form the cabin‚Äôs foundation.It was the hardest work I had ever done, as anyone who has ever dug post holes in a field of tree roots knows. But I was young and resilient. And my wife, Marianne, and I had availed ourselves of the rights and opportunities afforded in our system of government to borrow money, buy property and single-handedly build our American dream.Almost 250 years ago, our forefathers fought and many died to forge a nation with a unique Constitution that guarantees every citizen the freedom to pursue happiness in his or her own way.My dream, after being raised at 54th and Winchester in Chicago, was to have a place in the country where we could nurture in our children a passion for the outdoors, immersed in a paradise of woods and waters.In other corners of the world, that may be only a pipe dream. But in the United States of America, I was able to get a builder‚Äôs loan from a bank and stake our claim.With minimal experience in the building trades, I checked out how-to books from the library and subsequently drew up a plan for an 800-square-foot cottage with two bedrooms and a sleeping loft, set on wooden piers. Lacking a surveyor‚Äôs transit, I used a magnetic compass, some string and birthday party balloons (visible above the trees) to measure and plot a 20-foot-by-40-foot building site.With fewer building code restrictions in a rural area, I nailed together a frame house with 18 homemade windows and doors, two bathrooms and 100-amp electrical service. Jump River Electric hung a temporary line on a tree, and I took it from there.I toiled alone, except when Marianne and our three young children hiked through the woods from a rented house to bring me lunch every day at noon and when I had to hire licensed professionals for the well and septic in accordance with county regulations.At the end of six weeks, during which time I kept my tools in a tent and my work clothes in a plastic bag saturated with DEET to combat mosquitoes, I completed the outer shell of our ‚Äúlittle house on the prairie.‚Äù The following summer, we moved in while I finished the inside.Author David McGrath‚Äôs children, from left, Janet,‚Äã Mike and Jackie, play on a raft made from Coke syrup barrels near the family‚Äôs cabin in 1988 in northwestern Wisconsin. (Family photo)Spending every summer there, our kids learned to fish, swim, interpret calls of the loons and wave to neighbors on the way into town. We cooled off under a secret waterfall and used a rope and pulley to hoist our trash can up a tree, safe from black bears. Later, we got a black Labrador puppy who grew into a dog named Biff and whose barks and scent kept bears and other predators away.Thirty-eight years and two owners later, the house still stands, but with a new roof and a separate garage.More than just a fishing cottage, it was our investment in the nation, a nest egg that transformed our lives, for which we remain grateful.And the best way to return the favor is to perpetuate the American dream for future generations by doing all that we can, including wisely exercising our right to vote, in order to restore the earth and preserve democracy, equality and freedom.David McGrath¬†is an emeritus English professor at the College of DuPage and author of the newly released book ‚ÄúFar Enough Away,‚Äù a collection of Chicagoland stories.

GKJi1pTdV7QTdaN,BBC,google,Nine of the best TV shows to watch this July,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240701-nine-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-july,2024-07-06 06:07,2024-07-06 06:11,AAPL,,"From Natalie Portman's small-screen debut to violent Ancient Roman epic Those About to Die and a reboot of cult 1980s film Time Bandits. As Wednesday Addams' werewolf roommate Enid in the Netflix series Wednesday, Emma Myers helps solve murders. But here the actor stars as a more down-to-earth sleuthing student in this adaptation of Holly Jackson's popular YA novel. Myers is Pip Fitz-Amobi ‚Äì with that wonderful name, how could she not be special? ‚Äì who is determined to find the truth behind a supposedly solved murder-suicide that shook her school five years before. As school projects go, she gets points for ambition. Zain Iqbal plays her friend Ravi, whose brother was the presumed killer, and Anna Maxwell Martin is Pip's understanding mother. Dolly Wells, co-star and co-creator with Emily Mortimer of Doll & Em, directs the series. Unusually, Jackson wrote both a British and American version of the novel, each with different settings ‚Äì the fictional Little Kilton in the UK and Fairview, Connecticut in the US ‚Äì but the television version stays in Little Kilton. A Good Girl's Guide to Murder is currently on BBC iPlayer in the UK and premieres 1 August on Netflix internationally The topical theme of artificial intelligence meets a tried-and-tested mystery plot in this series starring and executive produced by Rashida Jones. She plays Suzie Sakamoto, an American living in Japan. When the plane her husband and small son are on crashes, the tech company her husband worked for gives her a robot companion for consolation ‚Äì a chatty little know-it-all named Sunny who vaguely resembles a metal Teletubby. Strange things start happening, and soon Suzie and Sunny team up to investigate what really happened to her son and husband, whose bodies have not been found. Jones navigates her role smoothly to express Suzie's grief and determination, as well as her sense of the absurd, in a show that has suspense and, thanks to Sunny and some chicanery from the tech company, some comic moments. Hidetoshi Nishijima, the star of 2021 Japanese Oscar-winner Drive My Car, is Suzie's husband, seen in flashbacks, whose ties to Sunny come as a big surprise to his wife. Sunny premieres 10 July on Apple TV+ internationally No pun was too cringey, no double entendre too obvious in the 2016 animated adult comedy Sausage Party, about food items in a supermarket ‚Äì and that was just what lots of people liked about it, as the film became an unexpected box office hit. The television spin-off features many of the same starry voices, notably Seth Rogen as Frank, the hot dog who discovered that food's fate is to go down someone's gullet, and helped engineer an escape from the store. Kristen Wiig returns as Frank's girlfriend, the hot dog bun Brenda, along with Edward Norton as Sammy Bagel Jr. New voices include Will Forte as the human whose help they need to build a utopia, and Sam Richardson as an orange, Julius. (Yup, a nod to the one-time fruit-drink chain of Orange Julius stores.) Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who were among the film's producers, are behind the television version too. They told Empire magazine: ""It's got all the heart, double the puns, and triple the food-on-food sex"". Sausage Party: Foodtopia premieres 11 July on Prime Video internationally Forest Whitaker brings gravitas and slyness to the role of Judge Oliver Garland in this Chicago-set series based on Stephen L Carter's 2002 bestselling novel The Emperor of Ocean Park. Garland dies of a heart attack in the show's opener. Or was he murdered? The timeline constantly flips between past and present. In the flashbacks, updated from the novel to 2009 and beyond, Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court is derailed because of some dicey connections in his past. In the present, his three children discover some dark secrets. His daughter, Mariah (Tiffany Mack) is conspiracy-minded to begin with, but that doesn't mean she's wrong when she suspects their father was killed. She has a hard time convincing her two brothers, Tal (Grantham Coleman), a law professor with marital problems, and Addison (Henry Simmons), a television journalist. Full of plot twists and family drama, the show is the latest evidence that legal thrillers are perfectly suited to television. Emperor of Ocean Park premieres 14 July on MGM+ in the US Time travel can be an irresistible fantasy for all ages, which is the idea behind this colourful family-friendly series based on Terry Gilliam's 1981 film about a boy who joins a band of robbers traveling through the ages. Here the band is led by Lisa Kudrow as Penelope, who brings 11-year-old Kevin (Kal-El Tuck) and her group to different periods of history, as they stop in the first days of Stonehenge, the Ice Age and the Middle Ages, among other eras. The show's creators are Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi ‚Äì the duo behind the vampire mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows, who share Gilliam's off-kilter comic style ‚Äì and writer Ian Morris, who collaborated with Waititi on his last film Next Goal Wins. The show lands in a different cultural moment from the movie. In the film, Kevin accompanied a band of dwarfs, who are not present in the television version. And the series has been shadowed by a controversy of its own. The actor Charlyne Yi recently alleged that they were ""physically assaulted"" and ""psychologically abused"" on set. In a statement, Paramount Television Studios said that they had ""conducted a full investigation regarding allegations that were brought to our attention"", and that ""additional steps were taken to address concerns"". Time Bandits premieres 14 July on Apple TV+ internationally Slipping into view ahead of Ridley Scott's hugely anticipated film Gladiator 2, which arrives in November, this sword-and-sandals action series has a pedigree of its own. Anthony Hopkins plays the Roman Emperor Vespasian, complete with flowing robes and a gold laurel wreath on his head. Roland Emmerich, the director of spectacles including Independence Day, directs five of the 10 episodes of the show about gladiators and those who try to kill them. And Robert Rodat, the screenwriter of Saving Private Ryan, is the series creator. The cast includes Iwan Rheon, best known as the villainous Ramsay Bolton on Game of Thrones. Peacock's official description calls his character, Tenax, a ""crime boss"" who runs a gambling operation for bets on all those vicious games in the newly-built Colosseum. Somehow that makes you imagine Tony Soprano in a toga, but it suggests how much Peacock is leaning into a connection between those 79 AD shenanigans and today. Those About to Die premieres 18 July on Peacock in the US and 19 July on Prime Video in the UK Starring in her first television series, Natalie Portman is a 1960s Jackie Kennedy lookalike as Maddie Schwartz, an upscale Baltimore housewife whose determination to solve the murder of a drowned woman turns her into a journalist. Moses Ingram (Josie in The Queen's Gambit) plays Cleo Johnson, the murder victim whose story is told in flashback in tandem with Maddie's bolt for freedom from her stifling marriage. Based on Laura Lippman's novel and written and directed by Alma Har'el (Honey Boy), the show takes on themes of feminism and Jewish and black identity, in the guise of a textured murder mystery. It was shot in Baltimore, where Portman's grandmother once lived, giving the role a special resonance. ""To have been there and imagined my family being there 60 years ago was really amazing,"" she told Vanity Fair. ""To imagine what it was to be a woman at that time in a Jewish marriage, the restrictions of what that meant at that time and place definitely felt personal to explore.""¬† Lady in the Lake premieres 19 July on Apple TV+ internationally A pod of people sheltering together during a pandemic sounds timely, but Boccaccio got there first, in the 14th Century to be exact. In The Decameron he imagined nobles and servants gathered in a villa outside Florence, where they told stories and hoped to avoid the bubonic plague raging outside. Kathleen Jordan, creator of this irreverent dark comedy very loosely based on Boccaccio, has said she approached his classic book as a series of ""short little horny tales"". The show is also set in Florence in 1348, with a range of characters including Tony Hale as the hapless steward of the villa where everyone is staying, Zosia Mamet as an entitled woman hoping to become mistress of the villa, and Saoirse-Monica Jackson (Derry Girls) as a put-upon servant. There is class conflict, but also drinking, dancing, sex and Survivor-style scheming in a series that counts Jenji Kohan (Orange is the New Black) among its executive producers. The Decameron premieres 25 July on Netflix internationally This Spanish-language drama, set in the early 1970s, is inspired by the real story of the first women to join Mexico City's police force. It did not go smoothly. The story focuses on four women who soon learn they are public relations window dressing, not expected to do any real crime-fighting and given whistles instead of guns. Their uniforms may make them look like airline hostesses of that era, with short blue skirts and high leather boots, but they are smarter than the dismissive men around them. Soon they go off on their own initiative to find a serial killer targeting women. The female officers are a mix of personality types, led by the fiercely determined Maria (B√°rbara Mori), along with Gabina (Amorita Rasgado), daughter of a respected policeman, the fingerprint expert Angeles (Ximena Sari√±ana) and the young, rebellious Valentina (Natalia T√©llez). That neat distribution may be typical, but the series also offers a fresh take on the female cop show.

EhiXF55Aqcs1nmy,The Motley Fool,google,Beyond Nvidia: AI Could Fuel High-Powered Growth for These Underappreciated Stocks.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/06/beyond-nvidia-ai-could-fuel-high-powered-growth-fo/,2024-07-06 06:18,2024-07-06 06:22,NVDA,,"Nvidia has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend. Its chips have been in high demand, which is powering tremendous revenue and earnings growth for the semiconductor company. It has made Nvidia one of the most highly valued companies in the world. However, Nvidia isn't the only company benefiting from the AI boom. The AI training models and applications that run on its chips reside in data centers. Those facilities are power-hungry buildings, especially when they support AI. Because of that, power demand could surge in the coming years. That should benefit energy stocks, including the underappreciated natural gas sector. Here are a couple of ways to play the potential AI-fueled boom in natural gas demand.Fueling the clean energy transitionNatural gas demand has grown steadily over the years. Several catalysts have fueled this growth, including replacing coal with the cleaner-burning fuel and rising LNG exports. Demand for gas could accelerate in the future, powered partly by AI data centers: Data source: EQT Corp.As that slide shows, data centers alone could drive an additional 10 billion to 18 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of demand by 2030. That's potentially more growth than the sector saw over the last decade. Many companies in the natural gas industry should benefit from rising gas demand. One potential beneficiary is the country's leading gas producer, EQT (EQT -1.94%). The company controls over 1.1 million net acres of land in the gas-rich Appalachian region (Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia). That large-scale position in one of the best gas-producing regions in the world enables it to produce gas at a very low cost ($1.36 per million cubic foot equivalent). EQT is also ideally situated to supply gas to power data centers. The company has pipeline access (either those it will soon own via its Equitrans Midstream acquisition, or from contracts with third-party pipeline operators) to several data center clusters: Data source: EQT. EQT should generate significant free cash flow in the coming years, fueled by growing gas demand and other catalysts like its pending Equitrans deal and contracts to supply new LNG export facilities. The company estimates that it could produce a cumulative $7.5 billion to more than $25 billion in free cash flow in the 2025 to 2029 period, assuming gas averages between $2.75 and $5 per MMBtu. That high end is more likely if AI lives up to its potential. This robust cash flow will give it the funds to repay debt, pay dividends, and repurchase shares, which could fuel strong total returns for investors. Transporting gas to demand centersNatural gas pipeline companies are another potential big beneficiary of rising power demand fueled by AI data centers. That catalyst would increase transportation volumes on existing pipelines while providing them with new expansion opportunities. One of the many potential beneficiaries is Williams (WMB -0.75%). The company operates the Transco pipeline, which runs along the East Coast, serving high-demand areas like Atlanta, Charlotte, North Carolina, and the capital region. Those areas are also hotbeds for data centers, which tend to be near major cities. In particular, Transco could be a key to supplying gas to data centers in Virginia. Regional utility Dominion Energy expects power demand from facilities in its service area to grow by two and a half times over the next decade. Williams currently has seven projects underway to expand Transco (and three more across its other major natural gas transmission pipelines). It has 30 more gas transmission pipeline projects in development. On top of that, the company has other gas infrastructure projects underway to grow its position in the Gulf of Mexico, Western U.S., and Northeast (where EQT operates). These projects give Williams a lot of visibility. The pipeline giant expects to grow its earnings by 5% to 7% annually over the long term. That should give it the fuel to increase its high-yielding dividend (recently around 4.5%) by a similar rate. That combination of dividend income, earnings growth, and valuation upside potential could enable Williams to generate robust total returns in the coming years. AI-fueled growth potentialNvidia has been an early beneficiary of the AI boom. However, the technology will likely fuel growth for many other sectors, including natural gas. The market hasn't yet fully appreciated the growth potential for the cleaner-burning fuel, which allows investors to get in early and potentially earn high-octane returns. EQT and Williams stand out as some of the biggest beneficiaries, given their proximity to where tech companies are building data centers.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

People don‚Äôt choose homelessness as a lifestyle; it is a symptom of the underlying problem of skyrocketing housing costs and increasing poverty.By criminalizing poverty, this decision will exacerbate the problem without providing solutions. Instead of forcing people into jail cells or pushing them onto other communities, we should be investing in services that help people find a place to live. We should be throwing them a lifeline, not cutting the thread they are hanging by.This decision demands congressional action. Congress must take immediate action to protect those among us experiencing homelessness and address the fact that rent is unaffordable for most Americans. Enacting a renter tax credit that offsets the high cost of rent is a good place to start.This horrendous Supreme Court decision should be the catalyst for Congress to finally act on America‚Äôs housing crisis. We the people must demand it.Sylvia LewisRochester'The darkest days of news in my lifetime'The bought and paid-for conservatives on the Supreme Court have just changed the most important principle in our Constitution on behalf of one deranged, criminally convicted ex-president. I can hardly fathom this. Because of one single person facing multiple felony counts and already found guilty in civil court of numerous sexual and fraud charges, the executive branch's power has been expanded into the realm of royalty.These have been the darkest days of news in my lifetime. I would never have dreamed a Supreme Court could go so terribly wrong and now we all have to live with its asinine decisions.Americans should not have to stand for this. There has to be a way to redress this terrible situation.Rob HendricksonTroyMore on the SCOTUS decision:Supreme Court presidential immunity ruling shakes up the Biden-Trump conversation'It's imperative that we do not give Trump a second term'Trump‚Äôs corrupt Supreme Court is out of control. SCOTUS just disallowed the Chevron deference. 40 years of policy, the Chevron deference allows experts at federal agencies such as the EPA, SEC, FTC and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to make regulations to protect us.The Supreme Court just took the power from the people and put it in the hands of billionaires. This decision eradicates consumer protection, environmental protection and worker protection regulations just to name a few. This gives federal judges the power to decide regulations instead of experts in the field.With at least a couple of Supreme Court justices likely retiring in the next few years, it's imperative that we do not give Trump a second term.Willian McMullinOak Park'Does it mean anything to swear to uphold the Constitution anymore?'In all its 235 years of existence, the legal question of whether a former president has immunity from prosecution for official acts had never come before the Supreme Court.That is until one Donald J. Trump upended the world as we know it.The recent Supreme Court ruling would seem to suggest that the President is more like a king, or as Trump would like to fashion himself, a dictator. We used to have a system of checks and balances among the three branches of government but not anymore. Rock, Paper, Scissors meet Sledgehammer.The extraordinary Supreme Court decision to grant immunity to the President for actions in office creates as Justice Sonia Sotomayor describes a ‚Äúlaw-free zone‚Äù around the president, writing that the ruling ""makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law.""In her dissent, she gives the hypothetical that a president can now have SEAL Team 6 assassinate a political rival. Is there anything to suggest that this Supreme Court would NOT give cover for an autocrat like Donald Trump to do exactly that? The lesson for future presidents is that you can now abuse the official levers of power under the guise of presidential duty and therefore be subject to immunity.Does it mean anything to swear to uphold the Constitution anymore?John Dean, Nixon‚Äôs White House Counsel referred to the 1972 Watergate scandal, ‚ÄúNixon would have had a pass‚Äù and that ‚Äúvirtually all of the evidence against Nixon‚Äù would have been off limits. This ruling jeopardizes the case that special counsel Jack Smith will bring against Trump for federal election interference and the events that led to the Jan. 6 insurrection. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote dissenting that the ruling constitutes a ""five-alarm fire that threatens to consume democratic self-governance.""Of course, it‚Äôs Biden who resides in the White House now, not the convicted felon Donald J. Trump. Maybe Trump should be the one who is worried about this new expansion of presidential power.Eddie DeeNoviMore:Election denying Matt DePerno running for Michigan Supreme Court? Yeesh. | Opinion'No one above the law'Recent Supreme Court decisions, including the ludicrous opinion that presidents enjoy total criminal immunity for any ‚Äúofficial acts‚Äù committed in office, have caused me to reflect on something that occurred many years ago.Back in 7th grade in one of my classes, the teacher had everyone complete a write-in ballot to identify what each thought was the most noble of careers. My dad was a medical doctor, so on my ballot, I indicated this as the most noble of careers. The thinking in my 12-year-old brain was that doctors are involved in the business of saving and improving life ‚Äì what can be more noble than that?However, a clear majority of my classmates thought differently and instead voted for Supreme Court Justice as the noblest of careers. While I disagreed then (and absolutely would do so today!), my classmates‚Äô thinking was that the Justices have the ability to impact (improve?) conditions for millions through their opinions, while a medical doctor generally impacts one life at a time.Over the years I have thought about this episode, and for a while, the Supreme Court, in my opinion, seemed to live up to the high noble standard. For example, the unanimous decision during Watergate to force Nixon to hand over the tapes, including two Justices placed on the bench by that president. There have been other examples over the years, even the intellectual jousting over many years by Justices Ginsburg and Scalia. In general, there was a firm belief that no one was above the law, including the president. These were the good years.Now, however, I believe we have a totally partisan Supreme Court. The court‚Äôs ‚Äúconservative‚Äù majority has crafted decision after decision this year to benefit one man. These justices claim to be originalists and textualists. They used this thinking to reject bans on bump stocks in guns, for example, stating there was no historical basis for the ban because the founders did not address this. As if they had any conception of bump stocks in 1789! Our founders made clear their intention that there be no king in the US ‚Äì yet today‚Äôs decision on presidential immunity basically gives the executive the total power of an 18th-century monarch to do whatever they want under the cloak of an ‚Äúofficial act‚Äù.

Is It a Buy Around Its All-Time ...,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/06/amazon-buy-stock-best-performing-dow-jones/?source=iedfolrf0000001,2024-07-06 06:35,2024-07-06 06:38,AMZN,,"Amazon (AMZN 1.22%) joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average in late February -- giving the traditionally stodgy, income-oriented index more exposure to growth.Amazon has continued its torrid run since 2023. As of June 27, it is the best-performing stock in the index.Here's why Amazon continues to climb higher and whether the growth stock is worth buying around its all-time high.Image source: Getty Images.Amazon is gushing cashBefore changing its name to Alphabet (GOOGL 2.57%) (GOOG 2.44%), Google was named after its flagship search engine. But YouTube is arguably Alphabet's crown jewel. Facebook was named after its flagship social media app, but then changed its name to Meta Platforms (META 5.87%). Instagram is arguably more valuable than Facebook today. Similarly, Amazon is named after its only retail outlet, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) is where much of the value lies.AWS is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure. According to HG Insights 2023 Infrastructure as a Service Market Report, AWS had a 50.1% market share among the top 10 cloud providers and the highest year-over-year customer count growth at 31%. AWS has been tapping into start-ups, with 86% of AWS customers spending less than $1,000 a month on AWS services -- according to HG Insights.The impact of AWS on the broader business is undeniable. Here's a look at Amazon's trailing-12-month (TTM) results as of the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same periods over the last five years.MetricQ1 2020 TTMQ1 2021 TTMQ1 2022 TTMQ1 2023 TTMQ1 2024 TTMNorth America revenue$181.09 billion$254.52 billion$284.71 billion$323.52 billion$362.29 billionNorth America operating income$6.06 billion$10.79 billion$2.25 billion($381 million)$18.96 billionInternational revenue$77.64 billion$115.96 billion$125.9 billion$118.37 billion$134.01 billionInternational operating income($2 billion)$2.37 billion($3.46 billion)($7.71 billion)$903 millionAWS revenue$37.55 billion$48.65 billion$67.14 billion$83 billion$94.44 billionAWS operating income$10.05 billion$14.62 billion$20.89 billion$21.45 billion$28.93 billionData source: Amazon.Notice the inconsistent operating income from Amazon's North America and international segments, as well as the somewhat sluggish top-line growth. Meanwhile, AWS has been a juggernaut, with TTM operating income increasing nearly threefold in just five years.The most impressive metric in this table is that AWS operating income has grown faster than AWS revenue, suggesting that margins are improving. Not long ago, one of the biggest red flags for Amazon's investment thesis was that AWS couldn't keep up its margins in the face of mounting competition. But the results tell a different story and are likely a reason why the stock has been crushing the market as of late.AMZN data by YChartsA higher-quality businessAmazon is notorious for reinvesting profits back into the company. So using net income-based metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio can be unhelpful. Traditionally, Amazon's go-to metric was its price-to-sales ratio, which is the value of a company compared to its revenue. In the following chart, you'll notice that Amazon's P/S ratio is higher than historical levels -- suggesting the stock is more expensive.AMZN PS Ratio data by YChartsThe P/S ratio can be useful when dealing with a consistent business over a period of time. But the issue with using it to evaluate Amazon is that the company is fundamentally different today than it was even two to three years ago because of the growth of AWS. That's why I think the best way to value Amazon is by looking at its P/S ratio within the context of its operating income and operating margin.AMZN Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThis chart is perhaps the simplest way to visualize Amazon's success. Amazon's TTM operating income is nearly $100 billion, and its operating margin is at a 10-year high thanks to AWS and a rebound in its North America and international segments.Paying a 3.53 P/S ratio for a high-growth, low-margin business is one thing. But that same ratio for a company growing its top line and expanding margins is entirely different.The biggest bull case for Amazon is that it is within striking distance of its historical P/S ratio, but the quality of the business is vastly improved, and it is on a path toward consistent profitability. After all, analyst consensus estimates call for $4.55 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $5.78 in 2025 EPS -- giving Amazon a 34.1 P/E based on 2025 estimated earnings. That's not a sky-high valuation -- especially when considering the stock is up 130% in 18 months.Amazon is stretched thin but is still a good buyAmazon is at the top of its game, but its stock chart reflects that. Warren Buffett once said, ""You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus."" In other words, consensus positivity toward a company usually results in an expensive stock price, just as an out-of-favor stock can be quite cheap.Less than two years ago, Amazon was under immense pressure due to slowing growth and recession fears. It was the opposite of a cheery consensus. Today, Amazon is, once again, a darling. But the long-term investment thesis has also gotten stronger as AWS continues to be a high-margin growth engine that can fuel the company's other exploits.All told, Amazon is a decent buy, but it is no longer the no-brainer buy it was before. It still must grow into its valuation and prove its higher margins aren't a one-off. If growth slows, expect Amazon to be under pressure.The higher a stock runs up in the short term, the more its valuation gets stretched. But over the long term, Amazon certainly has the trajectory needed to compound earnings and benefit patient investors.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amy was an artist, they said, so she‚Äôd appreciate the effort.¬†The bright pink flamingos were one of Amy‚Äôs favorite animals. She might have found the rainbow flowers that blow in the breeze comforting because she was gay. Melony‚Äôs daughter painted the pink and yellow butterfly statue specifically for her t√≠a, they said.¬†‚ÄúAmy loved to draw and paint so much ‚Äî she would do it everywhere,‚Äù Sarah, 34, recounted during a recent visit to St. Mary Cemetery in Evergreen Park while surrounded by a few other family and friends. ‚ÄúAs long as she had the image in her head she was going to put it down. It was very therapeutic for her.‚Äù¬†Amy Brown, 22, was fatally stabbed in the Back of the Yards neighborhood on June 26, 2022. Brown was often recognizable to her friends and family in her familiar red hat. (Family photo)Amy Brown, 22, was fatally stabbed during what police described as a domestic-related altercation in the Back of the Yards neighborhood on June 26, 2022. Two years after her  death, Brown‚Äôs family still mourns, cycling between the mixed emotions of shock, depression and anger that experts say are common for families of homicide victims. They also are calling for a renewed investigation into her case where no one has been charged.¬†¬†The night Brown died, officers responded to reports of a person stabbed in the 5200 block of South Carpenter Street around 10:25 p.m., according to a police report. Officers found Brown unresponsive outside on the grass with multiple stab wounds and two knives near her body, the report said. Brown‚Äôs family said she lived in the home where she was killed.¬†The alleged attacker‚Äôs hands and arm were covered in what officers believed to be blood, and he was placed in custody. He told officers at the scene that Brown had attacked him with knives after she came home screaming, according to the report. In self-defense, he then grabbed the knives away from her, and stabbed her, the report said.¬†Melony said the alleged attacker called her after the stabbing and told her what had happened, at which point she called 911. Sarah, who lived nearby, discovered Brown lying outside. Officers found her outside yelling for help when they arrived, the police report said.¬†‚ÄúAs soon as I get to the backyard, I see her laying on the side of the building. I automatically run to her, screaming to her, trying to wake her up, hold her,‚Äù Sarah said. ‚ÄúIt feels like it was forever, but then it feels like it was very fast.‚Äù¬†‚ÄúThe paramedics came. They tried to resuscitate. They cut her shirt off to see where her wounds were at,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúThe cops tried separating me from her. I didn‚Äôt want to leave her side because I wanted her to know that she was loved and that she was not alone.‚ÄùParamedics  took Brown to the University of Chicago Medical Center in critical condition, where she later died. The Cook County medical examiner‚Äôs office ruled Brown‚Äôs death a homicide caused by multiple sharp-force injuries. An autopsy showed she had more than 20 stab wounds.¬†A suspect was released without charges, police said at the time. A police spokesperson said Wednesday that the case is classified as ‚Äúexceptionally cleared, closed‚Äù because of a bar to prosecute. This means that police think they correctly identified the suspect in an investigation, but prosecutors declined to bring charges after evaluating evidence presented by detectives.¬†But both sisters said they want further investigation from police into the case to lead to criminal charges. They don‚Äôt believe the attack was in self-defense.¬†‚ÄúSee Amy as if she was their family member. How would they treat the case? Just because we are a minority and we come from different neighborhoods and we went to different schools ‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre not worth fighting for,‚Äù Sarah said. ‚ÄúHer life mattered, and that‚Äôs what hurts me the most.‚Äù¬†Grief for family members of homicide victims can be a lengthy process, said Dr. Traci Kurtzer, medical director of trauma-informed care and education at Northwestern Medicine‚Äôs Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. There are often initial feelings of horror and anger, which can evolve into feelings of sadness and isolation, she said.¬†Special occasions such as birthdays or anniversaries can heighten these emotions, she said. She recommends that families or friends experiencing them seek peer support or guidance from mental health professionals.¬†‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just such sadness about what happened, and in some cases there may even be a little bit of feeling guilt that maybe they missed signs, or they didn‚Äôt protect their loved one enough,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAs with anybody who loses somebody in a traumatic and violent way, it just never goes away. It‚Äôs always that sense that somebody who should be there is missing.‚Äù¬†When Melony, 36, thinks about Brown, she remembers her as a fun, dedicated aunt to her eight nieces and nephews. One year she dressed up as Santa Claus at Christmas for the kids, Melony said. Because she didn‚Äôt know how to properly talk like Santa, she reverted to a British accent, Melony laughed.Melony Bustamante and her daughter, Julie, embrace while visiting the graves of Melony‚Äôs sister, Amy Brown, and at St. Mary Catholic Cemetery in Evergreen Park on June 21, 2024. Brown was fatally stabbed during what police described as a domestic-related altercation in the Back of the Yards neighborhood on June 26, 2022. (Terrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune)She also described Brown as brave, energetic and bubbly, saying she enjoyed skateboarding, cooking, going to the beach and hanging out with friends. Her favorite food was ‚Äúanything to do with chicken‚Äù and she enjoyed listening to rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll,  specifically the Rolling Stones, Kiss and Nirvana. She was on staff at a hotel on the North Side, and hoped to move up to a cooking position one day, Melony said.¬†‚ÄúShe was a really good supporting, caring friend and sister,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt afraid to try anything new.‚Äù¬†¬†After Brown‚Äôs death, her family said the ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù didn‚Äôt end, especially because their mother had died a year prior. Brown‚Äôs grave is beside her mother‚Äôs at the cemetery.¬†Melony, who worked in the mental health field, said she left work for about a year. She signed up for therapy and enrolled in a partial hospitalization program. She said she spent a lot of time healing, sleeping and walking in nature. But she still struggles with nightmares, saying it can be very painful to think about her sister‚Äôs death, but that on the anniversary, she doesn‚Äôt want to sit idle any longer.¬†‚ÄúIt felt like and still feels like an absolute nightmare,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt absolutely draws a thin line between reality and stability. Some days, I just feel like it can all come crumbling down.‚ÄùAmy Brown was fatally stabbed in the Back of the Yards neighborhood on June 26, 2022. (Family photo)For Sarah, Brown was not just her little sister but her best friend ‚Äî they just clicked, she said.¬† Brown was caring, like their mom, and had a wild personality, she said. Brown also helped out with her kids after their father  died, she said.¬†She doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôll ever get over her death. But every day is different, and some are filled with hope, particularly when she sees the sunrise on the way to work, she said. She keeps a lawn chair in the trunk of her car for her frequent visits to the cemetery to talk with Brown and listens to the last song Brown recommended before her death ‚Äî ‚ÄúOne More Light‚Äù by Linkin Park.¬†‚ÄúWe sing her favorite songs. We eat chicken sandwiches all the time because that was her favorite food,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd every time I see a skate park, I get very excited because I know that‚Äôs something she would have liked to see.‚Äù‚ÄúI forget that sometimes she‚Äôs not here,‚Äù she said.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ku dhawaaqida Pezeshkian, oo 70 jir ah, ayaa timid ka dib markii mas'uuliyiintu ay sheegeen in uu helay 53.3%, in ka badan 30 milyan oo cod oo la tiriyay wareeggii labaad ee doorashada madaxtinimada.  Dhankiisa, Jalili wuxuu helay 44.3%. Codbixinta labaad ayaa timid kadib markii musharrixiinta midkoodna uusan ku guuleysan aqlabiyadda codbixintii ugu horreysay ee dhacday 28-kii June, taasoo ay u soo baxeen 40% codbixiyeyaal, waana codkii ugu hooseeyay tan iyo markii la aasaasay Jamhuuriyadda Islaamiga ah 1979-kii. Doorashadan ayaa timid ka dib markii madaxweynihii hore ee dalkaas Ibrahim Raisi uu ku geeriyoody shil dayaaradeed bishii Maajo, kaasoo sidoo kale ay ku dhinteen 7 qof. Isla markii lagu dhawaaqay natiijada, Pezeshkian ayaa u mahadceliyay taageerayaashiisa, wuxuuna ka codsaday dhammaan dadka reer Iran inay ku taageeraan shaqada adag ee hortaalla. ""Doorashada way dhamaatay tanina waa bilawgii isbahaysigeena,"" ayuu ku soo qoray bartiisa X (Twitter-kii hore). ‚ÄúWaddada adag ee ina hortaalla ma fududaan doonto adinka la‚Äôaantiin, garawshiyahiinna iyo aaminaadda, gacanta ayaan idiin fidinayaa, waxaana ku dhaaranayaa in aanan cidna idinka tagin‚Äù ayuu sii raaciyay. Muuqaallo la soo dhigay baraha bulshada ayaa muujinaya dabaaldegyo lagu taageerayo Pezeshkian ee Tehran iyo dhowr magaalo oo kale oo dalka ah. Muuqaallada la duubay ayaa u badnaa dhalinyaro damaashaadaya oo lulaya calanka cagaaran ee lagu garto ololihiisa, iyadoo gawaari waddooyinka marayeyna ay hoonka garaacayeen. Pezeshkian, oo ah dhakhtar qaliinka wadnaha ah, xubinna ka ah baarlamaanka, ayaa dhaleeceeyay booliska Iran ee muranka badan dhaliyay, wuxuuna wacad ku maray inuu raadinayo soo afjarida ""go'doominta"" Iran ee adduunka. Madaxweynaha la doortay ayaa ku baaqay ""wada xaajood wax ku ool ah"" oo lala yeesho quwadaha reer galbeedka si loo cusboonaysiiyo heshiiskii nukliyeerka ee 2015, kaas oo Iran ay ogolaatay in ay xakamayso barnaamijkeeda nukliyeerka si ay uga badbaadiso cunaqabataynta reer galbeedka. Si kastaba ha ahaatee, Pezeshkian looma tixgelin karo qas; Taas beddelkeeda, intii uu ku jiray shaqadiisa waxa uu si cad u sheegay in uu ku xidhan yahay hoggaamiyaha ugu sarreeya ee dalka, Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, iyo go'aannadiisa. ""Anigu waxaan ahay qof mabda' leh (qof ku xiran fikradaha sii adkeynaya Jamhuuriyadda Islaamiga ah) waxayna ka timid mabaadi'da aan raadineyno dib u habeyn,"" ayuu ku dhawaaqay intii lagu jiray ololaha. Pezeshkian sidoo kale ma ahan siyaasi saaxada ku cusub, isagoo xubin baarlamaan ka ahaa shan xilli. Mudadii uu ku jiray baarlamaanka waxa uu sidoo kale dhaliyay muran isaga oo u ololeynaya in daroogada aan dambi laga dhigin. ""Illaa ay dowladdu noqoto tan keenta daroogada, ma awoodno inaan joojino,"" ayuu yidhi. Waxa uu sidoo kale ahaa Wasiirka Caafimaadka 2001 ilaa 2005 xilligii dowladdii labaad ee Maxamed Khatami (1997-2005), oo loo arko madaxweynihii ugu horreeyay ee isbedel doonka ah ee dalkaas. Khatami ayaa taageeray musharaxnimada wasiirkiisii hore, si la mid ah Mehdi Karrubi, wadaadkii mucaaradka ahaa ee isku dayay inuu madaxweyne ka noqdo doorashadii lagu murmay ee Iran 2009, tan iyo markaas wuxuu ku jiray xabsi guri, sida ay ku warrantay laanta Persian ee BBC. Pezeshkian waxa uu hore isugu dayey in uu noqdo madaxa dawladda sannadaha 2013 iyo 2021. Markii ugu horraysay waxa uu ka tanaasulay in uu taageero musharrax kale, markii labaadna waxa diiday golaha wakiillada oo ka kooban 12 culimo iyo sharci-yaqaanno ah. Taageerada uu u fidiyay mudaaharaadyadii ka dhashay natiijadii doorashadii lagu murmay ee 2009 ayaa sabab u ahayd. Marka laga soo tago hoos u dhigista xiisadaha ka dhexeeya reer galbeedka iyo in Iran ay dib ugu soo noqoto fagaarayaasha caalamiga ah, madaxweynaha la doortay waxaa uu u ballan qaaday dadka dalkiisa inuu raadin doono ""isbeddel qaabdhismeedka"" oo u oggolaanaya dalka inuu gaaro horumar caddaalad ah oo dheellitiran. Ninka la tartamaya, Said jalili, wuxuu taageersan yahay in la joogteeyo xaaladda hadda taagan, wuxuuna u arkaa soo jeedinta madaxweynaha cusub inay qayb ka tahay ‚Äúqaab-dhismeed fashilmay‚Äù. Wuxuu ka mid ahaa kooxda wada xaajoodka Nukliyeerka ee Iran, waxaana uu taageero weyn ka dhex helaa culimada dalkaasi. Jalili ayaa caan ku ah mawqifkiisa mayalka adag ee reer galbeedka iyo sida uu uga soo horjeedo soo celinta heshiiskii Nukliyeerka, kaas oo uu sheegay in uu ka soo gudbay ""khadadka cas"" ee Iran. Codadka ayaa muujiyay in dad ka badan ay codeeyeen Jimcihii marka loo eego wareegii koowaad ee usbuucii hore, markaasoo tirada dadka u soo baxay ay ahayd tii ugu hooseysay tan iyo kacaankii Islaamiga ahaa ee 1979 iyadoo ay jirtay cabasho baahsan. Sida laga soo xigtay hay'adaha doorashada, dadka u soo baxay doorashada ayaa gaaray 49%, taasoo sagaal dhibcood ka sarreeysa maalintii doorashada ee hore. Qaar ka mid ah dadkii ka aamusay wareegii koowaad ayaa lagu qanciyay inay u codeeyaan Pezeshkian markan si looga hortago in Jalili uu noqdo madaxweyne. Waxay ka baqeen in guusha Jaliili, Iran ay u socoto iska horimaad hor leh oo ay la gasho reer galbeedka, taas oo keeni doonta kaliya cunaqabatayn cusub iyo go'doomin dheeraad ah. Si ay xaq ugu yeeshaan in ay isu soo sharaxaan, labada musharraxba waxa ay ku qasbanaadeen in ay soo maraan hannaan turxaan bixin ah oo uu hoggaaminayo Golaha Ilaalada. Hawshaasi darteed waxaa tartanka laga saaray 74 musharax oo kale oo ay ku jiraan dhowr haween ah. Golahan ayaa waxaa dhaleeceeyay hay‚Äôadaha xuquuqul insaanka oo ku eedeeyay in ay meesha ka saareen musharixiinta aan daacadda u ahayn dawladda. Ka dib sannado badan oo kacdoon shacab ah, oo ay dhacayeen mudaaharaadyo lagaga soo horjeedo dawladda oo gilgilay dalka 2022 iyo 2023, dhalinyaro badan iyo kuwa dabaqadda dhexe ah oo Iraniyiin ah ayaa si qoto dheer aamin darro uga qaaday nidaamka jira, waxayna hore u diideen inay codeeyaan. Baraha bulshada ee Iran, hashtag-ka Persian-ka ee ""khaa'inul waddaniyiinta tirada yar"" ayaa aad u faafay, iyadoo kooxaha qaar ay ku booriyeen muwaadiniinta inaysan u codayn labada murashax. Laakin Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ayaa diiday soo jeedinta ah in tirada yar ee codbixinta ay ka dhigan tahay diidmada hannaankii soo jiray tan iyo 1979kii. ""Waxaa jira sababo (ka danbeysa tirada yar ee codbixinta) iyo siyaasiyiinta iyo aqoonyahannada ayaa baari doona, laakiin haddii qof u maleynayo in kuwa aan codeynin ay ka soo horjeedaan nidaamka, gabi ahaanba waa khaldan yihiin,"" ayuu yiri.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

It‚Äôs enough to conjure images of the young and rich throwing wet Benjamins at a canvas a la Jackson Pollock and hoping they stick.The question is, do strategies like this paint a picture of financial gain?Wealth beliefs across the generationsOne characteristic that Gen Zers, millennials and baby boomers share, almost to the percentage point, centers on viewing their financial security as good or excellent: 75% for ages 21-43 versus 78% for those 44 and up.A slim majority of the 1,000-plus survey participants also saw interest rates as no cause for optimism. A combined total of 52% predicted that rates would either stay the same or increase, a merited assessment given the Fed‚Äôs move to call off at least two of its three anticipated cuts this year.The sharp divergence comes, then, with how the generations have chosen to build wealth. There‚Äôs distrust among millennials and Gen Z with the tried-and-true route, as 72% believe it's ‚Äúno longer possible to achieve above-average investment returns by investing solely in traditional stocks and bonds."" Only 28% of those 44 and older agree.Younger generations thus have a pronounced affection for crypto, the report stated, though that flies in the face of ""a headline fraud case in the burgeoning crypto industry"" that involved the fall of FTX.Story continuesMeanwhile, Binance, the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, pleaded guilty in November to breaking anti-money laundering laws, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations in a U.S. federal court ‚Äî agreeing to pay astounding fines that totaled $4.3 billion.Read more: Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year ‚Äî but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free)A (financial) appreciation of collectiblesWith art and vintage items, the collection attraction is understandable given how it also provides a consumerist buzz.After all, which is more gratifying, and downright fun? Owning 1,500 shares of General Motors, worth about $68,000? Or snagging a GM throwback ‚Äî say, a 1960 Chevy Corvette two-door convertible just like the one gracing the cover of Bruce Springsteen‚Äôs memoir ‚Äî that currently fetches an average of $69,200?As for whether a collectible-based strategy can build wealth, there‚Äôs no way to know definitively, especially when value is so speculative (a characteristic of crypto as well).Maybe that Corvette would've made for a turbocharged investment if you bought one new for $3,872, the price cited by JD Power. Still, with inflation, that's $39,900 today, calculations from the Minneapolis Fed show. That equals a return below 2x over 64 years and, to borrow from Boss parlance, not exactly born-to-run stuff.Compare that to the adjusted-for-inflation returns of the S&P 500. According to Macrotrends, a 1960 investment of about $600 would be worth $5,470 today: a return of more than 9x.As with crypto, hitting the jackpot on a sought-after item is often a matter of luck and timing, a tricky proposition at best. Keep in mind as well that the IRS taxes the sale of collectibles at a rate of 28%, a fact of financial life many young wealthy folk could easily miss.But all this hasn‚Äôt stopped the youthful and rich from snatching up watches, jewelry and wine/spirits, as those rank at the top of their lists; they‚Äôre also partial to rare automobiles, antiques and sneakers.

gYSjyxJeOynyNXB,CNBC,google,"These stocks, including Nvidia, have more room to run in July, Bank of America says",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/06/stocks-such-as-nvidia-have-more-to-run-this-summer-bank-of-america.html,2024-07-06 08:03,2024-07-06 08:09,PLTR,,"Bank of America said this week that a slate of stocks is poised for upside as the summer heats up. The firm said companies such as Nvidia are well positioned heading into the second half of the year. CNBC Pro combed through Bank of America's research to find buy-rated stocks that are too attractive to ignore. They include Nvidia, Carnival, Block and Palantir Technologies. Carnival Carnival is coming off better-than-expected earnings in late June. Bank of America analyst Andrew Didora said in a recent note that this bodes well for the stock in the months ahead. ""Cruise spend remains healthy, and CCL had positive commentary on the pace of 2025 bookings,"" he wrote. Didora said management is executing after a period of difficult years that included Covid-19 pandemic headwinds. Cost savings are underway with a balance sheet that could ""help drive a better valuation multiple,"" the analyst said. ""The steady fundamentals continue to provide the opportunity for balance sheet improvement, a key part of our investment thesis,"" Didora said. Carnival is off by 7% in 2024, which makes the stock extremely compelling, the analyst added. He lifted his price target to $24 per share from $23, which implies nearly 40% upside from Friday's close. Block The payment company is down almost 15% in 2024, but the dip is worth buying, according to analyst Jason Kupferberg. ""Shares have lagged in recent months while '24/'25 sell-side estimates have continued to increase,"" he wrote. The firm pointed to a few reasons for the stock's underwhelming performance, including changes in management and weaker-than-expected quarterly reports from other software companies. Still, Kupferberg is pounding the table for Block shares. ""We recognize concerns around US GPV [gross payment volume] growth and SMB [small and midsize businesses], but believe they have been over-discounted in shares,"" he said. Nevertheless, the company's fundamentals remain strong, and that is why shares are compelling, Kupferberg said. ""Attractive valuation no matter how you slice it,"" he added. Palantir Technologies Shares of the software company have soared nearly 60% this year, but analyst Mariana Perez Mora said Palantir is still a solid buy ahead of earnings in August. ""The market seems to be underpricing the risks around the next earnings announcement, offering an attractive entry point to own PLTR options, in our view,"" she wrote. Further, the analyst said the stock's technicals remain solid. ""PLTR remains within bullish trends on an absolute price basis and relative to the S & P 500,"" she added. Mora also sees a slew of positive catalysts on the horizon. They include possible inclusion to the S & P 500, as well as growing business through the U.S. Department of Defense. ""We're still in the early innings of AI adoption and expect Palantir (PLTR) to continue to see significant upside from this trend,"" she said. Square ""Shares have lagged in recent months while '24/'25 sell-side estimates have continued to increase ‚Ä¶ Attractive valuation no matter how you slice it. ‚Ä¶ We recognize concerns around US GPV [gross payment volume] growth and SMB [small and midsize businesses], but believe they have been over-discounted in shares.""

gYDIkaqyJemXhmU,Seeking Alpha,google,Amgen: Biotech Leader Riding High On Obesity Drugs Euphoria (Downgrade) (NASDAQ:AMGN),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702643-amgen-biotech-leader-riding-high-on-obesity-drug-euphoria-downgrade,2024-07-06 08:31,2024-07-06 08:35,AMGN,,"JHVEPhotoAmgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a high-quality biotech company with a well-diversified portfolio. Amgen has a solid pipeline focusing on five key therapeutic areas: Cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, inflammatory diseases, and rare diseases. I last covered AMGN stock with a Buy rating in December 2021. Since then, AMGN's spectacular performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (SPX) (SPY). Accordingly, AMGN recorded a total return of almost 60% compared to the SPX's 18% gain. Most of AMGN's gains have been recorded over the past year, and it has surged by more than 40%. Investors have accorded the biotech company significant optimism over its potential opportunities in obesity drugs through MariTide. Amgen management has been careful not to divulge too much information even as a ""broad phase III program is already underway."" In addition, Amgen also highlighted potential growth prospects in obesity-linked conditions and diabetes. Furthermore, Amgen has also planned for studies on diabetes patients with and without obesity, underscoring the comprehensiveness of Amgen's program. Given the success of the leading GLP-1 competitors, such as Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY), biopharma companies are accelerating their efforts in obesity treatments. Given AMGN's surge over the past year, I assess that the market has likely re-rated AMGN stock in anticipation of a higher probability of success. Furthermore, Amgen has assured analysts that it's implementing measures to ramp up its manufacturing capabilities. As a result, Amgen likely wants investors to know that the company has the appropriate framework to partake in a potentially $100B obesity drugs market by the end of the decade. Amgen pipeline milestones in 2024 (Amgen filings)Amgen reminds investors that it has a broad portfolio beyond obesity hype. As seen above, Amgen has significant milestones across four key therapeutic areas in 2024. Therefore, investors can rely on Amgen's demonstrated execution to mitigate the potential downside risks from its obesity studies. Wall Street's reaction to Amgen's obesity drugs potential is mixed, given the market leadership attributed to Novo Nordisk and Lilly. Furthermore, Lilly's next-gen obesity projects are underway. Therefore, the GLP-1 leaders could further stretch their leadership against their peers who are still conducting clinical studies. Consequently, I urge investors to pay close attention to MariTide's study results as they could impact AMGN's near-term volatility.   AMGN Quant Grades (Seeking Alpha)As seen above, the market has likely reflected significant optimism in AMGN's ""D-"" valuation grade. With a relatively tepid growth profile (""D+"" growth grade), investors must be wary about not overpaying on AMGN's opportunities with MariTide. Notwithstanding my caution, Amgen's fundamentally strong business model should continue underpinning robust buying sentiments (""A-"" momentum grade). Therefore, more attractive dip-buying opportunities could be assessed at potentially steep selloffs, benefiting investors. Moreover, AMGN's forward dividend yield of almost 3% exceeds its healthcare sector median by nearly 100%. As a result, income investors keen on investing in healthcare leaders will likely be key valuation anchors, potentially mitigating significant downside bias on AMGN. AMGN price chart (weekly, medium-term, adjusted for dividends) (TradingView)As seen above, AMGN hasn't been immune from steep selloffs over the past year. However, dip-buyers defended these pullbacks resolutely in May 2023 and April 2024. Therefore, it has helped to maintain AMGN's uptrend bias, giving investors more confidence in buying AMGN's dips. Notwithstanding my optimism, I have assessed stiff selling resistance close to AMGN's $325 level, behooving caution. Furthermore, AMGN's price action indicates buying momentum could be stalling, although a potential breakout could also be in the works. I assess that AMGN's uptrend continuation thesis remains intact. Therefore, a potentially steeper pullback toward the $280 support zone could help relieve selling pressure, affording investors a more attractive opportunity to buy more shares.

At the final whistle of their 16-15 defeat in Dunedin on Saturday, there was a sense of regret at what could have been. Steve Borthwick's side threatened an upset through Immanuel Feyi-Waboso's try, only to be denied a first win in New Zealand since 2003 by two second-half Damian McKenzie penalties.Marcus Smith impressed with ball in hand but missed three of his five kicks at goal in a disappointing performance from the tee.""We're gutted, of course we are,"" England captain Jamie George told BBC Sport.""Not many teams come here and do that to the All Blacks. It's a tough result to take.""We definitely weren't at our best but the fundamentals of our game, what we talk about regardless of the bounce of the ball, is us being out here and showing character and I think we did that in spades.""In the week they were talking about not knowing too many of our players - I think they'll know us now.""The problem for George and his talented young charges, perhaps, is what comes next. The sides will conclude their two-match series next Saturday at Eden Park, a venue where the hosts have reigned supreme against all foes for 30 years.""We will make it about the rugby, that's what it is always going to be about,"" added George.""There's so much to pick out from this game, learnings, disappointment and encouragement. ""What's happened in the past has happened in the past. We are here to win. ""We know that Eden Park is a tough place to play but we have won some big games recently and this would be a very special win in all of our careers."" New All Blacks head coach Scott Robertson let out a big sigh of relief at full-time as his tenure began with a narrow victory.England's blitz defence had charged at his side all night. New Zealand fans will be accustomed to seeing their side play with attacking fluency, but England's line speed restricted them space to execute their skills.It led to a change of tactics in the second half. The hosts kept the ball at close quarters and tried to overpower their visitors, who were up to the challenge.George Martin and Chandler Cunningham-South both dominated the collision with new All Blacks skipper Scott Barrett in a display of defiance, and last year's World Cup finalists were restricted to just 16 points at home. ""A decent welcome to Test rugby,"" Robertson told BBC Sport.""From the kick-off in the second half the arm wrestle started and they wouldn't let us out of it.""I'm relieved rather than ecstatic. I will sleep well tonight knowing we got the result but also wake up early knowing we've got some work to do. ""Man, they are a good team and they have played some good footy this year and they were a moment away [from winning].""England are playing their best rugby of the Borthwick era, in a year in which they have denied Ireland back-to-back Grand Slams.""You don't often see New Zealand play a game like that and it became a proper arm wrestle,"" Borthwick, who was a member of the England squad the last time they won in New Zealand, told BBC Sport.""I'm proud of all the players. We want to keep getting better and improve. ""Today's another step but let's be clear, we're disappointed with the loss.""Ultimately there were opportunities we didn't take but when you look at this England team, I'm excited for the future.""",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some couples are having 'micro weddings' instead",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/06/couples-are-having-micro-weddings-as-average-cost-now-over-30000.html,2024-07-06 09:00,2024-07-06 09:03,COST,,"Vanessa Acosta and her now husband decided to have a ""micro wedding"" in their backyard instead of a black-tie wedding with 100-plus guests.Slashing their guest count to roughly half saved them thousands of dollars.Here's how a smaller wedding can help you save costs. Last year, Vanessa Acosta and Sam Roberts found their dream venue for a black-tie wedding.But a series of family events made the couple reconsider their plans: ""We don't need to do this big thing where we're going to put ourselves out financially,"" said Acosta, 35, of Pasadena, California.Instead of hosting around 150 guests and spending about $75,000, the couple decided to get married in their backyard with just 54 of their closest family and friends.More from Personal Finance: Couples leverage ‚Äòsomething borrowed‚Äô to cut wedding costsNearly 1 in 5 student loan borrowers keep their balance a secret from partnerWhy couples avoid talking about financial issuesSuch events with roughly 50 guests, max, are called ""micro weddings."" A so-called minimony is even smaller, usually attended by no more than 10 people, according to The Knot, an online wedding marketplace.Acosta and Roberts had a new budget of $3,000, and they knew they needed to get creative.""We DIY'ed and thrifted everything,"" Acosta said. ""We thrifted my husband's shirt, he used his really nice dress shoes he already owned. I made my dress and I thrifted the fabrics; I made my veil.""Cutting the guest list made the wedding ""much more manageable,"" she said. The couple tied the knot on May 25. The average cost of a wedding ceremony and reception in 2023 was $35,000, according to The Knot 2023 Real Weddings Study. The total cost is a $5,000 increase from 2022.Inflation over the past few years was a key driver to higher costs, according to the Knot. The report polled 9,318 US married couples between January 1 and December 2023.¬†¬†""Put simply, weddings are expensive,"" said Allison Cullman, wedding expert and the vice president of brand marketing and strategy at Zola, another online wedding marketplace. As the cost of typical weddings in the U.S. has swelled in the past few years, experts say cutting down the guest list is the best way to save on costs, even if you don't trim it to micro-wedding levels.In 2023, weddings with 25 to 50 guests took up about 15% of the market; weddings with less than 25 guests made up roughly 2% of the market, according to data from The Wedding Report, a wedding research company, provided to CNBC.The average guest count at weddings has been declining since 2006, when the average was about 184 people, according to data from The Wedding Report. The lowest count was in 2020, when the average headcount declined to 107, primarily due to restrictions from the Covid-19 pandemic, said Shane McMurray, CEO and co-founder of The Wedding Report. The size of weddings rebounded in 2021 to 124 because people wanted to socialize after the lockdowns, he said.""But because of how expensive it is to get married now,"" he said, the size of weddings is ""probably going to start to come back down.""""The number one way to save money on your wedding is to cut the guest count,"" said McMurray, as many wedding costs, like meals, invitations and favors, are based on your headcount.Indeed, ""having a minimony or a micro wedding allows you to still have an incredibly special celebration without having to pay for 150 meals,"" said Cullman. ""It literally was not stressful to deal with the food situation for like a 50-ish person wedding,"" said Acosta, who booked a taco stand for $640 instead of roughly paying $90 per plate for about 150 guests.""Ninety times 150 people. It was a drastic change to go from that to a taco stand that was able to feed every single one and there was still food left over,"" said Acosta. Engaged couples should come up with a ""clear and realistic"" budget from the beginning, as well as make a list of what their priorities are, said Cullman. Doing so will help you when you have to make ""difficult decisions to stay within your budget,"" she said.""Couples should discuss what is the most important to them, and what they want to allocate towards items that will make their wedding feel unique, authentic, and most of all, fun,"" said Cullman.Confirming such priorities will help you ""determine where to focus your budget and where you can save,"" said Lauren Kay, executive editor of The Knot.You might need to make trade-offs along the way. ""Typically, the venue requires the majority of your budget, and food and beverage costs are determined by the number of guests,"" said Kay. ""So if the location is your highest priority, keeping this in mind will help you properly allocate your budget and make decisions on the guest list size.""Being flexible with the ceremony date can also help reduce costs, said Cullman, as off-peak dates can be less expensive.Exploring ""upcycled"" or thrifted attire typically won't ""set you back hundreds of dollars,"" she said. In that vein, you can even take the proverb of ""something borrowed"" more seriously and rent a wedding dress or even flowers.

And as cars become more complicated to repair and more crowded under the hood, the cost of fixing and regularly maintaining vehicles is getting more expensive.Explore More: 7 Reliable Car Brands the Middle Class Should Consider To Save Money in the Long RunBe Aware: How To Get $340 Per Year in Cash Back on Gas and Other Things You Already BuyRepair prices are rising in comparison to the overall rate of inflation. According to CNBC, ‚ÄúMotor vehicle maintenance and repair costs increased 4.1% per year from November 2013 to November 2023, compared with just 2.8% for the overall consumer price index.‚ÄùADVERTISEMENTFurthermore, the growth has been particularly noticeable since the pandemic. Prior to it, repair costs rose at an annual rate of 3.5% to 5%, according to Ryan Mandell, director of performance consulting at Mitchell, a leader in providing automotive repair software. However, in 2022, the rate increased to around 10%. Year-over-year in May, the motor vehicle maintenance and repair index has jumped 7.2%, per Bureau of Labor stats.Over the past decade or so, the advancement of more sophisticated vehicles and manufacturing methods, more costly collisions and a lack of talented technicians are among the factors that have increased car repair costs.More Complex VehiclesOver the years, cars have become very electronically advanced. Every vehicle now has sensors in them, including ‚Äúbasic‚Äù popular cars like Toyota Corollas and Honda Civics. ‚ÄúYour average regular car now is basically a rolling network of computers,‚Äù said David Goldsmith, who owns the repair shop Urban Classics. ‚ÄúThat means parts and labor on these cars has gone up to what was once reserved for premium or luxury cars.‚Äù‚ÄúEven simple repair task requires lots of time, knowledge and specialized tools in modern cars,‚Äù said Evaldas Zabitis, an automotive expert at carVertical. ‚ÄúMore power leads to higher pressures, more efficient cooling, more durable materials and other improvements to ensure longevity. As a result, fuel injectors are 5-6 times more expensive, while fuel filters can be up to 10 times more expensive.Story continues‚ÄúFurthermore, there‚Äôs considerably less room to work under the hood, causing more time spent on repairs. ‚ÄúModern cars are over-engineered to the point where all the control units and other components hardly fit inside, leaving no extra room for maintenance and repairs.‚Äù‚ÄúFor example, to replace a starter motor in some Audi and Volkswagen models, the manufacturer recommends removing the engine first, whereas it‚Äôs a 10-minute job in older cars,‚Äù said Zabitis. ‚ÄúWith turbochargers, emission control systems and control units surrounding the engine bay, many essential components aren‚Äôt easily accessible anymore.‚ÄùCheck Out: 10 Affordable Compact Cars That Will Last 300,000 MilesMore Collisions on the RoadsAccording to the National Safety Council, the mileage death rate has decreased 93% since 1923 and now stands at 1.33 deaths per 100 million miles driven. While that is ‚Äúgood‚Äù news, there are more drivers and vehicles on the road ‚Äî and more collisions ‚Äî than ever before.With technology improving and cars equipped with more and more safety features, low speed crashes may happen less frequently. However, cars are heavier and more powerful now, and speeding and traffic crashes have increased. As a result, vehicles are getting into worse collisions that are more complicated and costly to repair.Shortage of Auto TechniciansThere is a shortage of skilled automotive technicians working in repair shops across the U.S. Finding qualified technicians has been extremely difficult due to an aging workforce, the required skills to repair modern cars and the number of older cars requiring maintenance as drivers continue to keep their cars longer.During the COVID-19 pandemic, less people were on the roads and vehicles were requiring less repairs, which caused more technicians to leave the industry in search of other work. As repair talent becomes scarce, wages are increasing in order to attract and keep technicians, which is eventually reflected in repair costs.‚ÄúTo top it off, many young people aim for careers with great growth potential, therefore, a technician‚Äôs career is becoming a less common choice,‚Äù said Zabitis. There is a lower-than-average earning potential in the industry, according to MarketWatch, with the average wage for an automotive technician about 20% lower than the national average.More From GOBankingRates9 Things You Must Buy at Big Lots While on a Retirement BudgetI'm a Mechanic: These 4 Cars Have Engines That Could Die on You3 Things to Do This Week If You Have Debt3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Cost of Car Repairs: Then vs. Now",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

ikFHXvPke9EniHX,USA Today,bing,Never-before-seen Pontiac G8 concept hints at alternate universe awesomeness,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2024/07/06/never-before-seen-pontiac-g8-concept-hints-at-alternate-universe-awesomeness/74238887007/,2024-07-06 09:00,2024-07-06 09:18,GM,,"There are readers today that were born well after Pontiac‚Äôs collapse and probably wonder what all the fuss is about, considering we have Chevrolet and Cadillac. For you youngest viewers, Pontiac was the brand that used to be the boldest side of GM. Well, up until the 1980s when it just became a simple exercise of badge engineering. Then, there was a spark of hope with the release of the 2004 GTO, 2006 Solstice and the 2008 G8 sedan. For the briefest moment in time, it looked like Pontiac would become the brand enthusiasts had hoped for again. Then, it died. Now, with GM Design opening its vault to virtual viewers, we now see a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù in this 2008 Pontiac G8 concept that never even saw the light of day ‚Äî until now.The demise of Pontiac: A lesson in bloatThis concept, according to GM Design, is the final concept for the Pontiac brand and was created at the Advanced Studio in California. At the time, GM was failing in the throes of the Great Recession, and required two Congressional bailouts to survive. One of the stipulations of this lifeline was a requirement to reduce the number of brands it had. Pontiac was one of the four it would end up shuttering. What we and the public at large didn‚Äôt know was that GM had an interesting future for Pontiac in development before it shuttered: an all-new G8 sedan.Never before seenGoodbye, Challenger:Dodge flexes its new 2024 Charger Daytona EVIt‚Äôs a shame the G8 Concept never saw the light of day, as it is spectacular looking and previewed what would have been a new and distinct look for the brand, different from the rest of GM's lineup. That said, the G8 Concept does show off some of the ""good"" broader GM corporate design language of that era. Up front, the concept wears Pontiac‚Äôs distinct grille design, but the headlights and top fender bulges are a mix of the Solstice and Cadillac CTS cues. Interestingly, this includes the hood vents like the ones found on the Saturn Sky, a departure from the nostrils typically found on high output powered Pontiacs.Muscular and framelessThe body sides show significant fender protrusions to indicate this is part of the ‚Äúwide track‚Äù performance legacy Pontiac created in the late 1950s. We also see a bit of the Camaro‚Äôs ‚ÄúCoke bottle‚Äù shape in the rear quarter panel. Something that would be unique for GM at this point would be that fender port that extends into the front door, a feature not seen on a modern GM car until the second generation of the Cadillac CTS. In a nod to future car design, the front door handles pop out to open the door but then return to flush when driving. The rear doors don‚Äôt have a handle and the pre-painted concept don‚Äôt show any sort of hidden opening for one, so we‚Äôd imagine this would be a touch sensor of some sort. And, yes, the doors did open on this concept, but your guess is as good as ours on how that ‚Äúfloating‚Äù plate in the middle of the port moved to allow it. Most likely it was a cutout that protruded into the door.What‚Äôs also hard to tell with the windows up that the G8 concept uses frameless doors, in that there is no frame for the windows to snug into. It also means there isn‚Äôt a full B-pillar to add structural reinforcement to the center of the roof. With modern rollover standards, and especially in the EV era, it seems like a production version would probably have lost one of those two features for safety reasons.Following the body out to the rear of the 2008 G8 concept, we see that Pontiac had intentions of taking the design language of the Solstice into much larger vehicles. The nearly the entire rear design, including the exhaust tips formed into the rear bumper, all reference that awesome little convertible. What makes the G8 concept different is the inset rear glass design with sporty side buttresses, which would still be a bold design choice today, and the Saturn Sky-like taillights. Another unique feature for a sedan at the time would be the use of a hatch over a standard decklid trunk space. Whether a production version would keep the notchback profile or go to a more sloping traditional liftback design is anyone's guess, but the the Solstice coupe's roofline could be a hint as to the direction it would have taken.427 Shelby Dragonsnake:Why is this beast being built again?A future Corvette-feeling interiorThe performance theme extends to the interior. The G8 Concept features seating for four with individual sports seating for all passengers. The center console extends all the way into the rear passenger area and looks like the generous opening of the cargo area allows those rear seats to recline. The interesting portion is how the driver‚Äôs side is laid out. It seems to loosely preview the C8 Corvette's bold (but controversial) center console arrangement. It also looks like the steering wheel features paddles within the finger length of the person behind the wheel, but the dashboard is fully analog rather than the large screen we‚Äôre all now used to in modern cars. The center pod between the tachometer and speedometer is a shift position indicator. We can‚Äôt help but feel that it also would have been the perfect location for a shift light, as well.What would have beenWe know, we know. The production G8 wouldn‚Äôt have been this wild, but it doesn't seem like the G8 Concept was created in vain ‚Äî some of its elements can be found in subsequent GM vehicles. And even if a production G8 were watered down, the surviving influences would have made it a handsome and interesting vehicle. Could it have been a winning sport sedan? That‚Äôs hard to say, but the G8 that Pontiac actually built is generally considered to be a modern classic, and the subsequent GM sport sedans, like the Cadillac CT-series, have been dynamically excellent. It‚Äôs a fun what-if story at best because ‚Äî at the end of the day ‚Äî Pontiac is dead and not looking like it will be revived anytime soon.Photos by Manufacturer",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has since been updated to reflect the most recent data.When it comes to potentially making fortunes in the stock market, the key is to always invest in the next big thing. Don‚Äôt pile into what‚Äôs big today ‚Äì focus on what will be big tomorrow.¬†Here in July 2024, for example, all eyes are on what we‚Äôre calling AI 1.0 ‚Äì AI software and chatbots like ChatGPT. Since their emergence, they‚Äôve taken over the world and continue to be very popular.¬†But when it comes to what will be big tomorrow, we‚Äôre focused on AI 2.0 ‚Äì an emerging AI technology that Elon Musk himself thinks could make Tesla (TSLA) a $25 trillion company!Now, Tesla isn‚Äôt even worth $600 billion today ‚Äì so, we‚Äôre talking about more than 40X potential upside if true. Regardless, it‚Äôs safe to say that Musk is about as bullish as you could be on the future of AI 2.0. And he‚Äôs not alone.¬†Nvidia (NVDA), the poster child of the AI Revolution, is also betting big on AI 2.0.¬†So are Microsoft (MSFT) ‚Äì the world‚Äôs largest AI company ‚Äì and Amazon (AMZN). Even OpenAI, the leader of AI 1.0, is staking a claim.¬†All are pouring millions of dollars into AI 2.0.This is the next wave of AI ‚Äì the next big thing. And, yes, this is a tech megatrend you need to invest in today if you want to make a potential fortune.AI 2.0: The Rise of the RobotSo, what exactly is AI 2.0?The real-world application of AI technologies via humanoid robots.¬†Yes, I‚Äôm talking about AI-powered robots like the ones you‚Äôve seen in science-fiction movies like ‚ÄúiRobot.‚Äù¬†This application may seem like a pie-in-the-sky dream. But humanoid robots are already in development. This new AI wave is here.¬†Don‚Äôt believe me? Well, Nvidia also recently announced the introduction of the Project GROOT Foundation AI model, designed to enhance the performance of humanoid robots, alongside a new system-on-a-chip named Thor for robotic use. This move comes as notable companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Tesla (more on that in a moment), Amazon, and Intel (INTC) heavily invest in humanoid robot development. With Nvidia joining the fray, the advent of sophisticated robots appears imminent. And we‚Äôre head over heels for this compelling investment opportunity in AI robotics.In fact, as I write, Tesla is busy developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. And already, it can do things like fold clothes, make eggs, exercise and dance.¬†Tesla sees a world in the not-too-distant future where these robots are everywhere, helping people all across the globe complete menial tasks like cooking, cleaning, organizing, and more.¬†Elon Musk is even on record saying that in time, Optimus could be bigger than Tesla‚Äôs core vehicle business.¬†In fact, he actually thinks that future is just around the corner. This past week, he predicted that there will be, ‚Äúover 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla‚Äù by 2025.¬†That‚Äôs next year.¬†He also predicted that Optimus will make Tesla worth $25 trillion, more than 40X its current valuation and 8X Apple‚Äôs market cap.And we don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs delusional. If he is, then it seems Jeff Bezos must be, too.¬†The former Amazon founder and CEO is reportedly pouring $100 million into a humanoid robot startup called FigureAI.Clearly, he sees a bright future for humanoid robots as well.¬†And guess who else is investing in FigureAI? Bezos‚Äô old company, Amazon. The titan is pouring $50 million into FigureAI. So is Microsoft, with a $95 million commitment to the startup ‚Äì not to mention $50 million from Nvidia, too.Or how about OpenAI? The ChatGPT creator is already FigureAI‚Äôs biggest investor, and it‚Äôs throwing another $5 million into the firm.¬†Plus, Intel and Samsung are also reportedly investing in FigureAI right now as well.¬†The Final WordFolks, it seems the writing is on the wall.¬†You may think of AI-powered humanoid robots as a mere sci-fi concept.¬†But as with the world‚Äôs most powerful people, the foremost AI innovators clearly think humanoid robots are the next frontier, too.¬†They see them as AI 2.0.

Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF) is believed to have pulled the trigger on the deal with Rivian (RIVN) considered one of the few companies near Tesla (TSLA) on the tech/design side for operating system/software. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas noted that Rivian (RIVN) investors may want the Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF) relationship to go much further than plugging short-term cash flow gaps. ""If the VW JV is just a new way to bring yet more capital into Rivian without changes to the strategy/capital discipline profile of the company, then investors should prepare for the challenges to continue,"" he warned. However, Jonas and his team think that if the VW deal is a prelude to a potential change in strategy or structure, then new paths of optionality may open up. For investors, Rivian's (RIVN) strategic value is seen as greater than its discounted cash flow value. Jonas said it would have been unlikely that Rivian (RIVN) could have obtained $5 billion from Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF) without the company's capabilities in software, vertically integrated hardware, and in-house autonomous architecture. The bullish view from Morgan Stanley on Rivian (RIVN) is that the electric vehicle maker is uniquely positioned outside of Tesla (TSLA) to scale a fully integrated software stack critical to unlocking the broad AI opportunity. Notably, that AI opportunity could be snapped up by investors at a market value 1/60th that of Tesla (TSLA). The AI wildcard plays a big part of Morgan Stanley's bull case price target of $33 on Rivian (RIVN). Rivian's (RIVN) background: The company was founded in 2009 by RJ Scaringe, initially under the name Mainstream Motors, which later became Avera Automotive before settling on Rivian in 2011. Rivian (RIVN) acquired a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois, in 2017, which became its primary manufacturing facility. In 2018, Rivian unveiled its first models, the R1T electric pickup truck and the R1S electric SUV. The company went public in November 2021, raising $13.5 billion. In late June, the electric vehicle maker disclosed that it intends to form a joint venture with Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF) to create next-gen electrical architecture and best-in-class software technology. The partnership is anticipated to accelerate the development of software for Rivian (RIVN) and Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF). The partnership is seen as allowing both companies to combine their complementary strengths and lower the cost per vehicle by increasing scale and speeding up innovation globally. Rivian (RIVN) plans to contribute its electrical architecture expertise and is expected to license existing intellectual property rights to the joint venture. Both companies aim to launch vehicles benefiting from the technology created within the joint venture in the second half of the decade. In the short term, the joint venture is expected to enable Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF) to utilize Rivian√¢¬Ä¬ôs existing electrical architecture and software platform. As part of the partnership, Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF) will make a $5 billion investment in Rivian (RIVN). Shares of Rivian (RIVN) are up more than 25% since the Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF) deal was announced.

The culprit? Her televangelist father! It‚Äôs teased at the end of ‚ÄúX‚Äù that powerful preacher Ernest Miller (Simon Prast) is her estranged dad, but he shows up in ‚ÄúMaXXXine‚Äù with a whole crew of followers who‚Äôve gone to desperate lengths to bring his daughter back to the fold. Suffice it to say, she‚Äôs not down and winds up blowing her father‚Äôs head off in extremely gory fashion.The original incarnation of ‚ÄúMaXXXine‚Äù involved Maxine being ‚Äúhaunted‚Äù once more by Pearl (who menaced the heroine in ‚ÄúX‚Äù before Maxine crushed her noggin under a tire during her escape). The plan was for some ‚Äúturning-into-Pearl body horror stuff,‚Äù West says, but after ‚Äúfussing around with that‚Äù for a couple weeks, the director decided to nix the supernatural elements. ‚ÄúIt just felt like going backward wasn't what these movies were about (and) it just wasn't as compelling handcuffing her to the past in that way.‚Äù'Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F' review: Eddie Murphy brings Big Dad Energy From 'Beverly Hills Cop 4' to 'A Family Affair,' 10 movies you need to stream right now 'A Family Affair': How Nicole Kidman pulled off 'movie magic' in a grocery store Eddie Murphy talks new 'Beverly Hills Cop' movie, Axel Foley's 'Everyman' charm Cannibals, swingers and Emma Stone: Let's unpack 'Kinds of Kindness' Kevin Costner talks about his major movie gamble 'Horizon'Does ‚ÄòMaXXXine‚Äô have a post-credits scene?Nope, but the final sequence is meaningful in West‚Äôs overall mythology.

The ‚ÄúMaXXXine‚Äù moment was an image ‚ÄúI always had in my mind as having made it in Hollywood. That was such a goal for her, was to become a star,‚Äù the director explains.‚ÄúThere's something about the end of ‚ÄòPearl,‚Äô about her smiling and trying to keep smiling, that‚Äôs representative of the movie as a whole. And there's something also about this severed head on the bed being photographed that's representative of the absurdity of it all as well.‚ÄùFor the record, sitting for a life cast was more arduous than marathoning that infamous ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù smile, Goth reports. ‚ÄúWhen you're in a scene like that and it feels like it's going well, it's euphoric. You're kind of like on this magic carpet ride.‚ÄùWill Mia Goth's Maxine Minx return for another movie?She made it out of the worst porn shoot ever in the 1970s and finally went legit in the ‚Äô80s. Maybe the next film could be Maxine going for an Oscar in the ‚Äò90s?¬†‚ÄúI just don't know where else it can go at this point,‚Äù Goth says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible that we were able to do this (trilogy).

Among the new details: Archit Grover, charged with theft over $5,000 and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence, is a ""longtime friend"" of Parmpal Sidhu, who was working at the Air Canada Cargo terminal at the time of the heist, and now faces identical charges. Grover is the owner of the white truck that was used in the robbery, and the employer of Durante King-McLean, the man whom police say was driving the truck. King-McLean¬†also faces a charge of theft over $5,000. Grover's cousin, Amit Jalota, who faces two counts of possession of property obtained by crime, along with charges of theft and conspiracy, ""looked after the gold"" along with ""an associate"" Arsalan Chaudhary, who faces the same charges. Police allege that Jalota also ""facilitated the melting"" of a small quantity of gold via Ali Raza, the owner of a Mississauga jewelry store, who faces a charge of possession of property obtained by crime. Prasath Paramalingam and Ammad Chaudhary, who both faces accessory after the fact charges, are accused of having ""assisted"" King-McLean cross into the United States after the robbery, and having ""provide(d) him with the ability to stay in the U.S. for a long period of time.""

Yet, in an ironic twist, the company's very success has created favorable conditions for its rivals to take down the AI titan a notch or two from atop its perch. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 4.88%) realizes the opportunity a supply-constrained Nvidia has presented and intends to fully exploit these fortuitous circumstances to its advantage.Why the Nvidia spillover effect creates unparalleled opportunities for AMDNvidia's unprecedented revenue growth, its rising stock price and consequential market capitalization have all demonstrated that the AI infrastructure market is sustainable and unbounded. Hyper-demand for Nvidia's chips has dispelled any lingering doubts that AI mania is merely another dot.com bubble waiting to burst.Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)chips are the lifeblood of generative AI systems. Semiconductor companies, such as AMD, provide the essential chip architecture capabilities necessary to create and sustain such systems. Tech companies that build or design these indispensable components are the only businesses at present able to convert the AI hype into an appreciable revenue reality.Hardware companies such as Dell and Lenovo, as well as cloud providers, need AI chips immediately at competitive prices to meet rising customer demand. They can't secure chips from Nvidia fast enough, which means buying GPU hardware from other sources.Realizing the profit potential presented by this current supply and demand imbalance, AMD has stepped into this supply void swiftly. It has seized this opportunity by quickly ramping up production of its AI GPU series 1300 processors as an alternative to Nvidia's offerings for a tech sector hungry for data center chips.AMD looks poised to grow its AI presenceLike other semiconductor companies, over the past two years, AMD has suffered from a chip glut that is only now starting to dissipate as tech companies wind down their excess inventories. Poor performance in the company's two non-data center segments resulted in tepid overall revenue growth of 2% year-over-year.The company's gaming segment was down 48% year-over-year; its embedded segment, which provides processing needs for the industrial, automotive and testing industries, fell 46% year-over-year.The more telling metric for ascertaining the company's prospects, however, is the astounding growth in the company's data center business. Revenues from this segment grew an astounding 80% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. The client segment, which provides CPUs for servers, laptops, mobile and desktop devices, surged 85% to $1.4 billion.Accelerated growth from the data center and client segments prompted the company to raise its full-year 2024 guidance from $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion. CEO Lisa Su stated that based on customer engagements, these estimates are realistic.Over time, earnings from AMD's cloud GPU sales will far surpass that of the two non-data center segments that have dragged down overall revenue.A compelling investment opportunity for long-term appreciationGiven its flat year-over-year revenue growth, at 46 times the next twelve months' earnings, AMD's current valuation appears to be stretched. At 47 for the same multiple, Nvidia barely beats AMD by this same metric, even though its recent growth rate has been much greater.Since it's categorized as a semiconductor stock, AMD's current valuation, however, doesn't fully reflect its long-term revenue potential. For a company just entering the AI GPU business, AMD's data center growth was off the charts. The market will continue to respond favorably to AMD's offerings because cloud providers welcome the competition. Many don't want to be locked into Nvidia's ecosystem.By some estimates, the AI market could grow to $403 billion by 2027 and $1 trillion by 2030. These projections demonstrate the extent to which AMD can benefit from AI's long-term revenue potential.Cloud providers want competitive chip pricing which opens a wide door for AMD and others to carve into Nvidia's market share. With its focused AI data center strategy, over time, AMD's valuation as an AI stock will grow, as the company's increasing earnings reveal that its long-term AI growth potential is sustainable.Investors shouldn't expect any short-term gains from the stock. Purchasing AMD is suitable only for those with a long-term investment horizon.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
zmu2opFIbJtya6k,Seeking Alpha,google,Is Tesla Stock An AI Robotics Company? Possibly (NASDAQ:TSLA),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702589-is-tesla-an-ai-robotics-company-possibly,2024-07-06 10:00,2024-07-06 10:10,TSLA,,"PhonlamaiPhoto/iStock via Getty Images We previously covered Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)(NEOE:TSLA:CA) in April 2024, discussing the three key factors why we believed that the company might face further downgrades, as the automaker failed to leverage its first mover advantage and electric vehicle (""EV"") know-how to address the volatile market trends and sales cycle through the $25K mass-market model. With its installed capacity under-utilized and consumer demand waning, it remained to be seen how and when a reversal in market sentiments might occur, resulting in our reiterated Hold rating then. Since then, TSLA has retraced by -17% to retest its previous support levels of $140s, before recovering after the FQ1 '24 earnings call and further rallying to $240s after beating FQ2 '24 delivery estimates. Even so, our sentiments remain pessimistic, since the beat is only attributed to drastically lowered consensus estimates, with the automaker company is likely to still report impacted automotive margins in the upcoming FQ2'24 earnings call post-market on July 23, 2024. We will also be highlighting a few metrics to look out for in the upcoming earnings call, with them underscoring the performance of TSLA's business segments along with near-term prospects. TSLA's Investment Thesis Remains Expensive - No Margin Of Safety     TSLA YTD Stock Price To Other Mag 7 Stocks Trading View For now, on a YTD basis, TSLA has underperformed the wider market despite the +73% rally from the April 2024 bottom, with us concurring that the stock ""does not look like a Magnificent 7 stock anymore."" TSLA's Grand Ambitions TSLA In the grand scheme of things, TSLA is reportedly a ""more than just vehicles"" company, attributed to its well diversified offerings as listed in the chart above. 1. TSLA Remains A One-Trick Pony, For So Long As Its Side Ventures Are Not Yet Monetizable  TSLA's Statement Of Operations TSLA Even so, we must remind readers that TSLA currently only monetizes its Automotive, Energy Generation/ Storage, and Services/ Others as of FQ1 '24, with each segment reporting mixed QoQ/ YoY performances aside from the Energy Generation/ Storage segment. It is apparent that the drastic price cuts have not worked out in its favor as well, as observed in the impacted automotive gross profit margins of 15.6% (-1 points QoQ/ -2.6 YoY) and overall operating margins to 5.4% (-2.8 points QoQ/ -6 YoY) in FQ1'24. At the same time, we may see TSLA's automotive segment face more headwinds, with the EU already announcing new tariffs for Chinese-made BEVs (unspecified) and US tariffs jumping drastically from 25% to 100%. While there has been no confirmation if the US-based company may eventually be exempted, the long-term implications are undeniable indeed, since the Shanghai Gigafactory exported 347K EVs globally in 2023 (no breakdown reported for the US), comprising 19% of its overall deliveries. Furthermore, driver appetite for EVs has also waned in China and the US, as they turn to PHEVs, also known as Hybrids. For example, Ford (F), the leading automotive brand in the US in 2023 based on volumes sold, has reported growing volumes for Hybrid sales at +49.6% YoY in H1 '24, compared to +6.1% YoY in H1'23. The same has been reported by BYD (OTCPK:BYDDF), with it delivering 556.71K Hybrids (+71.6% QoQ) compared to 426.03K EVs in FQ2 '24 (+41.9% QoQ), building upon the accelerating QoQ trend observed over the past few quarters. Combined with the robust Hybrid demand in the EU, we believe that TSLA's one-trick EV pony may have temporarily lost its edge in an intensely competitive automotive market as consumers' tastes suddenly change. Combined with the overly niche Cybertruck market and minimal lineup refresh, compared to the well diversified offerings from other legacy/ start up automotive peers, we believe that TSLA's recent performance has left us wanting, yet again. This is especially since the FQ2'24 production of 410.83K (-5.2% QoQ/ -14.3% YoY) and deliveries of 443.95K (+14.7% QoQ/ -4.7% YoY) remain underwhelming on a QoQ/ YoY basis, with the QoQ jump in deliveries only attributed to the lower deliveries during Chinese New Year festivities in FQ1 '24 and constant price cuts thus far. Compared to TSLA's installed capacity of up to 2.35M and the implied ~30% in redundant capacity, we believe that the upcoming FQ2'24 earnings call may bring forth more pain to its automotive gross margins indeed. 2. FSD/ Robotaxi Monetization Remains Uncertain   While TSLA slated to hold its Robotaxi event in August 2024, it is uncertain how the management expects to launch and monetize this segment, with multiple Big Tech/ legacy players, such as Alphabet's Waymo (GOOG) and General Motor's Cruise (GM), still burning cash while failing to scale domestically, let alone globally. In our previous Uber (UBER) coverage here, we had reckoned that TSLA might be using their excess inventories as the Robotaxi fleets while partnering with the former's ride-share platform as a go-to-market strategy, allowing the automotive company to rapidly monetize the segment. Growing FSD Miles Driven & AI training Capacity  TSLA Combined with the growing FSD miles driven and AI training capacity, it appears that TSLA's ambitions of achieving vehicle autonomy and a ride-hailing service are not too ambitious indeed. At the same time, we must highlight it has cleared multiple FSD hurdles in China, with the company potentially test launching its Robotaxi capabilities there first, especially given the country's booming market and the progressive regulations. On the other hand, readers must note that the TSLA CEO has had a penchant for 'elongated timelines,' as observed in the multiple FSD, Robotaxi, and EV claims made over the past few years, with the ""show me the money"" event yet to take place. Therefore, while we concur that there are massive opportunities in this new end-market, it remains to be seen when we may see those claims substantiated. We also concur with JPMorgan (JPM), in which ""we do not expect material revenue generation likely for years to come,"" with the segment potentially being a bottom-line drag, underscoring why investors need to temper their intermediate term expectations. 3. Humanoid Robots The Evolution Of TSLA's Robots X TSLA continues to tout it being an ""AI robotics company,"" while introducing Optimus - Gen 2 robots by the end of 2023 and guiding the sale of its robots ""as soon as the end of next year"" (2025). However, we believe that these claims remain rather ambitious, especially since the CEO expects to build the robots ""at a volume for about $10,000 a unit and sell them for $20,000, resulting in a $1 trillion profit."" For reference, TSLA's US-based robotic competitor, Boston Dynamic, had previously commercially launched an entry level four-legged robot at $75K in 2021 (without a self-charging dock while being more limited in its autonomous capabilities), compared to other full autonomous four-legged robots at $150K then. While a growing manufacturing scale may eventually lower ASPs, readers must note that TSLA has yet to achieve its low cost $25K EVs thus far, with it remaining to be seen if the 2025 robotics launch may come at the advertised sticker price of $20K. For now, it appears that TSLA has been making great progress in reducing costs, with Optimus - Gen 2 mostly made of a lightweight material, Polyether Ether Ketone, with the plastic material naturally being cheaper than those made of metal. At the same time, another Chinese humanoid robot company, Unitree, has already announced a relatively promising entry-level price point of $16K for Unitree G1, naturally benefiting from the country's lower cost of labor. Even so, with TSLA only reporting two robots working in factory floors as of H1 '24 and volume manufacturing still a distance away, we believe that it may be better to take the CEO's words with a (large) grain of salt. This is especially given the intensifying robotics market competition in China, potentially triggering more headwinds to its near-term prospects. TSLA Is Even More Expensive Here - Offering A Minimal Margin Of Safety The Consensus Forward Estimates Seeking Alpha As a result of its impacted EV prospects and uncertain FSD/ Robotaxi/ Humanoid Robot monetization, it is unsurprising that the consensus has further lowered their estimates, with TSLA expected to chart a lower top/ bottom-line growth at a CAGR of +12.4%/ +12.7% through FY2026. This is compared to the original estimates of +20.8%/ +28.9% (at the start of the year) and the historical growth at +40.9%/ +290.1% between FY2019 and FY2023, respectively, implying its maturing business profile barring the emergence of a new top/ bottom-line driver in the near-term. TSLA Valuations Seeking Alpha Combined with the overly optimistic stock rally over the past two weeks, it is undeniable that the TSLA stock is overly expensive at FWD P/E valuations of 96.73x, compared to the previous article at 57.68x, 1Y mean of 65.29x, and the sector median of 15.06x. For so long that its side ventures have yet to show signs of successful monetization, we believe that TSLA needs to be temporarily valued as an automotive/ energy storage/ solar company. Even then, TSLA's energy storage capabilities are partly attributed to battery cells made by CATL and BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDF), with the former responsible for the end assembly into complete systems for different applications. Due to the minimal margin of safety, we believe that TSLA does not offer a compelling investment thesis at these inflated levels.  So, Is TSLA Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold?  TSLA 4Y Stock Price Trading View For now, TSLA has charted an eye-watering vertical rally after the FQ2 '24 delivery update, as the market overreacts to the supposed beat, the ratified CEO pay package, and supposedly lower EU tariffs. The upward ride has been very optimistic indeed, with the stock well exceeding our previous fair value estimates of $207.60 offered in January 2024, based on the 1Y P/E mean valuation of 65.29x and the consensus FY2023 adj EPS estimates of $3.18. This also means that there is now a minimal margin of safety to our long-term price target of $292.40, based on the same 1Y P/E mean and the consensus FY2026 adj EPS estimates of $4.48. At the same time, we maintain our previous conclusion that TSLA is likely to be rather volatile moving forward, attributed to the mixed signals on EV demand, multiple key events occurring in H2'24, and the uncertain macroeconomic outlook through 2026, if not 2027. While we concur that TSLA now looks a lot more interesting, thanks to the numerous advancements in its Robotaxi and Humanoid Robot developments, it remains uncertain it these may eventually be top-line accretive with the bottom-line drag almost a certainty. While we have most certainly missed the recent rally, we are uncertain if there is any more upside ahead, with most likely baked-in already.  Readers may be better off waiting for more clarity from the upcoming FQ2 '24 earnings call on July 23, 2024, before chasing this rally, resulting in our reiterated Hold rating for the TSLA stock.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Get Fully Charged   The Cybertruck isn't as ""unflippable"" as other Teslas  Teslas proved very impressive when during safety testing they were almost impossible to flip in the tests specifically designed to cause it. The Cybertruck is the tallest Tesla on sale, though, so it has the highest center of gravity and it's the easiest vehicle in the manufacturer's lineup to roll.    However, if you are truly reckless, you can roll a vehicle as heavy and powerful as the Cybertruck. This accident reported in Vicksburg, Mississippi, is the first instance we know of when a Cybertruck ended up on its roof. It appears that it failed to make a turn, climbed onto a steep embankment, which flipped it, and made it land on its roof. The debris on the road indicates where the Cybertruck made contact with the embankment was approximately 100 feet from where it stopped. This strongly suggests it was carrying some speed when it happened, probably more than the 6,600-pound (or 6,800-pound if it was the tri-motor Cyberbeast) truck could handle, it understeered into the embankment, which probably even briefly launched it into the air.  ¬† This is an unusual sight (and not one we‚Äôll likely see very often), and it looks like a pretty serious accident, but none of the four occupants were seriously injured.

We scan the universe of roughly 7,500 stocks listed and traded on U.S. exchanges and use our proprietary filtering criteria to select five relatively safe stocks that may be trading cheaper compared to their historical valuations. Some of the sections in the article, like ""Selection Process/Methodology,"" are repeated each month with few changes. This is intentional as well as unavoidable, as this is necessary for the new readers to be able to conceptualize the process. Regular readers of this series could skip such sections to avoid repetitiveness. ************ Markets are always unpredictable. However, to be a successful investor, fortunately, we do not need to know exactly where the market is going. We believe it is not possible to catch the exact bottom (or the peak), so it is best to invest regularly and consistently in good, solid dividend-paying stocks when their valuations are attractive. Against this backdrop, keeping some cash reserves and dry powder ready to deal with any scenario is important. Data by YCharts The main goal of this series of articles is to shortlist and highlight companies that have a solid history of paying and raising dividends. In addition, we demand that these companies support strong fundamentals, carry low debt, and are offered at a relatively cheaper valuation. These DGI stocks are not going to make anyone rich overnight, but if your goal is to attain financial freedom by owning stocks that would grow dividends over time, meaningfully and sustainably, then you are at the right place. These lists are not necessarily recommendations to buy but a shortlist of probable candidates for further research. The purpose is to keep our buy list handy and dry powder ready so we can use the opportunity when the time is right. Besides, every month, this analysis is able to highlight a few companies that otherwise would not be on our radar. Every month, we start with roughly 7,500 stocks that are listed and traded on U.S. exchanges, including over-the-counter (OTC) networks. Using our filtering criteria, the initial list is quickly narrowed to roughly 700 stocks, mostly dividend-paying and dividend-growing. From thereon, by using various data elements, including dividend history, payout ratios, revenue growth, debt ratios, EPS growth, etc., we calculate a ""Dividend Quality Score"" for each stock that measures the relative safety and sustainability of the dividend. In addition to dividend safety, we also seek cheaper valuations. We also demand that the selected companies have an established business model, solid dividend history, manageable debt, and an investment-grade credit rating. This month, we highlight three groups with five stocks each that have an average dividend yield (as a group) of 3.61%, 5.30%, and 7.78%, respectively. The first list is for conservative and risk-averse investors, while the second is for investors seeking higher yields but still wanting relatively safe dividends. The third group is for yield-hungry investors but comes with an elevated risk, and we urge investors to exercise caution. Notes: 1) Please note that when we use the term ""safe"" in relation to stocks and investments, it should be interpreted as ""relatively safe"" because nothing is absolutely safe in investing. Even though we present only 5 to 10 stocks in our final list, one should have 15-20 stocks at a minimum in a well-diversified portfolio. 2) All tables in this article are created by the author unless explicitly specified. The stock data have been sourced from various sources such as Seeking Alpha, Yahoo Finance, GuruFocus, Morningstar, and CCC-List (Dividend Radar). The Selection Process Note: Regular readers of this series could skip this section to avoid repetitiveness. We include this section (in part) for new readers to provide the necessary background and perspective. Readers can also read a more detailed explanation of the goals and the selection process in our blog post here.  Criteria to Shortlist:  Market cap > $10 billion ($8 billion in a down market) Dividend yield > 1.0% (some exceptions are made to include high quality but lower yielding companies) Daily average volume > 100,000 Dividend growth past five years >= 0.  By applying the above criteria, we got around 600 companies. Narrowing Down the List As a first step, we would like to eliminate stocks that have less than five years of dividend growth history. We cross-check our current list of over 600 stocks against the list of so-called Dividend Champions, Contenders, and Challengers originally defined and created by David Fish. Generally, the stocks with more than 25 years of dividend increases are called dividend Champions, while stocks with more than ten but less than 25 years of dividend increases are termed Contenders. Further, stocks with more than five but less than ten years of dividend increases are called Challengers. Also, since we want a lot of flexibility and wider choice at this initial stage, we include some companies that pay dividends lower than 1.40% but otherwise have a stellar dividend record and growing dividends at a fast pace. After we apply all the above criteria, we're left with 364 companies on our list. However, so far in this list, we have demanded five or more years of consistent dividend growth. But what if a company had a very stable record of dividend payments but did not increase the dividends from one year to another? At times, some of these companies are foreign-based companies, and due to currency fluctuations, their dividends may appear to have been cut in US dollars, but in reality, that may not be true at all when looked at in the actual currency of reporting. At times, we may provide some exceptions when a company may have cut the dividend in the past, but otherwise, it looks compelling. So, by relaxing some of the conditions, a total of 70 additional companies were considered to be on our list. We call them category 'B' companies. After including them, we had a total of 434 (364 + 70) companies that made our first list. We then imported the various data elements from many sources and assigned weights based on different criteria as listed below:  Current yield: Indicates the yield based on the current price. Dividend growth history (number of years of dividend growth): This provides information on how many years a company has paid and increased dividends on a consistent basis. For stocks under the category 'B' (defined above), we consider the total number of consecutive years of dividends paid rather than the number of years of dividend growth. Payout ratio: This indicates how comfortably the company can pay the dividend from its earnings. We prefer this ratio to be as low as possible, which would indicate the company's ability to grow the dividend in the future. This ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend amount per share by the EPS (earnings per share). The cash-flow payout ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend amount paid per share by the cash flow generated per share. Past five-year and 10-year dividend growth: Even though it's the dividend growth rate from the past, this does indicate how fast the company has been able to grow its earnings and dividends in the recent past. The recent past is the best indicator that we have to know what to expect in the next few years. EPS growth (average of previous five years of growth and expected next five years' growth): As the earnings of a company grow, more than likely, dividends will grow accordingly. We will take into account the actual EPS growth of the previous five years and the estimated EPS growth for the next five years. We will add the two numbers and assign weights. Chowder number: So, what's the Chowder number? This number has been named after well-known SA author Chowder, who first coined and popularized this factor. This number is derived by adding the current yield and the past five years' dividend growth rate. A Chowder number of ""12"" or more (""8"" for utilities) is considered good. Debt/equity ratio: This ratio will tell us about the company's debt load in relation to its equity. We all know that too much debt can lead to major problems, even for well-known companies. The lower this ratio, the better it is. Sometimes, we find this ratio to be negative or unavailable, even for well-known companies. This can happen for a myriad of reasons and is not always a reason for concern. This is why we use this ratio in combination with the debt/asset ratio (covered next). Debt/asset ratio: This ratio will tell us about the debt load in relation to the company's total assets. In almost all cases, this ratio would be lower than the debt/equity ratio. Also, this ratio is important because, for some companies, the debt/equity ratio is not a reliable indicator. S&P's credit rating: This is the credit rating assigned by the rating agency S&P Global and is indicative of the company's ability to service its debt. This rating can be obtained from the S&P website. PEG ratio: This is also called the price/earnings-to-growth ratio. The PEG ratio is considered to be an indicator if the stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced. A lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued. However, PEG for a company may differ significantly from one reported source to another, depending on which growth estimate is used in the calculation. Some use past growth, while others may use future expected growth. Distance from 52-week high: We want to select companies that are good, solid companies but also are trading at cheaper valuations currently. They may be cheaper due to some temporary down cycle or some combination of bad news or simply having a bad quarter. This criterion will help bring such companies (with a cheaper valuation) near the top as long as they excel in other criteria as well. This factor is calculated as (current price - 52-week high) / 52-week high. Sales or Revenue growth: This is the average growth rate in annual sales or revenue of the company over the last five years. A company can only grow its earnings power as long as it can grow its revenue. Sure, it can grow the earnings by cutting costs, but that can't go on forever.  Downloadable Dataset: Below, we provide a link to the table with relevant data on nearly 400 stocks. Readers can download this table for further analysis. Please note that the table is sorted by ""Total Weight"" or ""Initial Quality Score."" File-for-export-5_Secure_DGI_-_July_2024.xlsx Selection Of The Top 50 We will first bring down the list (of about 400) to roughly 50 names by automated criteria, as listed below. In the second step, which is mostly manual and subjective, we will bring the list down to about 15.  Step 1: First, take the top 20 names from the above table (based on total weight or quality score). At times, some industry segments tend to get overcrowded at the top, so we take the top two (or three) and ignore the rest. Step 2: As a second step, we will take the top 10 names based on the highest dividend yield. When it comes to dividend yield, some of the industry segments tend to be overcrowded. So, we will take the top two (or a maximum of three) names from any single industry segment. We take the top 10 stocks after the sort to the final list. Step 3: Now, we will sort our list based on five-year dividend growth (highest at the top) and select the top 10 names. Step 4: Not all companies have a 10-year streak of dividend growth, but many do. We will sort our list based on 10-year dividend growth (highest at the top) and select the top 10 names. Step 5: We also want to give priority to stocks that are rated highest in terms of credit rating. So, we will sort the list based on the numerical weight of the credit rating and select the top 10 stocks with the best credit rating. Again, we are careful not to have too many names from the same sector. Step 6: Lastly, as the name of the series suggests, we want to have some names that may be trading cheaper in comparison to their historical valuation. So, we select the top ten names with the highest discount. However, they could be trading cheap for just the wrong reasons, so we need to be careful that they meet our other quality criteria.  From the above steps, we now have a total of 70 names in our final consideration. However, the following stocks appeared more than once: Stocks that appeared two times: ADP, CI, DHI, GFI, MSFT, TSM, V, VOYA (8 duplicates) Stock that appeared 3 times: NKE (2 duplicates). After removing ten duplicates, we are left with 60 (70-10) names. Since there are multiple names in each industry segment, we will keep a maximum of two or three names (from the top) from any one segment. Also, if the dividend yield was too low (< 0.75%), we would rather remove them at this stage unless the growth potential is extraordinary. After some pruning, we are left with 50 names. The top names from each sector/industry segment are presented: Financial Services, Banking, and Insurance: Banks - Regional: Banks - Major: (JPM), (BNS) Financial Services - Others: (MS), (VOYA), (ARCC) Security & Exchanges √¢¬Ä¬ì Asset Management/ Inv Bank √¢¬Ä¬ì (RJF) Insurance: (OTCQX:ZURVY) Business Services/ Consulting: (V), (ADP) Conglomerates: (CSL) Industrials: (PH), (AGCO), (ALLE) Transportation/ Logistics: Chemicals: (FMC) Materials/Mining/Gold: Materials - others: (MOS) Mining (other than Gold): (RIO) Gold: (GFI) Defense: None Consumer/Retail/Others: Cons-Staples: (PEP), (ADM), (PG) Cons-discretionary: (NKE), (SIRI) Cons-Retail: (TGT), (DKS) Tobacco: (BTI) Communications/Media (VZ), (BCE) Healthcare: Pharma: (JNJ), (BMY), (SNY) Healthcare Ins: (CI) Healthcare Services: Technology: (MSFT), (TSM), (AVGO), (NXPI) Energy: Pipelines/ Midstream: (MPLX), (ENB) Oil & Gas (prod. & exploration): (EOG), (OVV) Energy Majors: (CVX) Utilities: (NEE), (NRG) Housing/ Construction: Home Building: (DHI), (LEN), Building Material: Construction & Engg: (PWR) REIT: (CCI), (GLPI). Final Step: Narrowing Down To Just Five Companies In this step, we construct three separate lists of five stocks each, with different sets of goals, dividend income, and risk levels. The lists are: 1) Relatively Safe (Low-yield) Dividend list, 2) Moderately High Dividend List, 3) Ultra High Dividend List, and 4) A combined list of the above three (duplicates removed). Out of the top 50, we make our judgment calls to make these three lists, so basically, the selections are based on our research and perceptions. So, while most of the filtering until now was based on automated criteria, the last step is pretty much subjective. We try to make each of the three lists highly diversified among various sectors and industry segments and try to ensure that the safety of dividends matches the overall risk profile of the group. We certainly encourage readers to do further research on the highlighted names. Nonetheless, here are our three final lists for this month: Final A-List (Relatively Safe Income): Average yield: 3.61%  (MSFT) (ADP) (PEP) (SNY) (ENB)  Table-1A: A-LIST (Conservative Income) Author We think this set of five companies (in the A-List) would form a solid, diversified group of dividend companies that would be appealing to income-seeking and conservative investors, including retirees and near-retirees. The average yield is 3.61%, which is nearly 2.75x of what the S&P 500 pays. The average dividend history is nearly 34 years. Also, all five companies have an investment grade credit rating, and four out of five have an excellent rating of AA- or higher. If you must need higher dividends, consider B-List or C-List, presented later. MSFT (Microsoft): MSFT is a technology behemoth that needs no introduction. It is part of the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' in the S&P500. It has paid and raised dividend payouts for the last 22 years and is only a few years away from being a dividend aristocrat. It has had tremendous growth in its share price since 2014, and there seems to be no let-up in its upward trajectory. Most recently, in 2023, it has led the AI wave from a position of strength, as it owns a major stake in ChatGPT maker OpenAI (thanks to its $10 billion investment in OpenAI). In fact, its AI Services are expected to contribute significantly to its Azure cloud growth in the future. Microsoft is likely to continue leading in the Cloud and AI space. All that said, the stock price is not cheap, and the dividend yield is quite low despite 10% plus growth in payouts for the last ten years. We are including it in the A-List for its growth prospects, stellar credit rating, and stable and growing dividends. ADP (Automatic Data Processing): ADP has paid and grown its dividend payout for the last 49 years and is known for the reliability and growth of its dividends at a steady pace. It is only a year away from becoming a Dividend-King. Even though its current yield is mediocre, relatively high growth should compensate in the long run. Currently, the shares are not particularly cheap and are hovering near their 52-week high. We are still including it in the A-list for its exceptional record of growing dividends and growth and excellent credit rating. PEP (PepsiCo): PepsiCo is an iconic American company that operates around the globe. It owns well-known household brands, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lay's, Cheetos, and Doritos, among others. The company is the second-largest beverage company behind Coca-Cola, and beverages account for nearly 45% of its revenues. The rest of the revenue is generated by Snacks and Convenience foods. The company generates nearly 40% of total sales and nearly a third of its profits outside the US. Besides, last year, PepsiCo became a Dividend-King, meaning it has increased its dividends consistently for the last 50-plus years. For dividend investors, it is quite a milestone. PepsiCo is a must-have in every DGI portfolio; however, it should be added at the right price. In our view, currently, it is trading close to its fair price, though not cheap by any means. It is yielding roughly 3.29% against a 5-year average of 2.75%. Morningstar puts the fair value close to $176 a share, which is nearly 8% above the current price. Also, it is 14% cheaper than its 52-week highs achieved in July 2023. There are short-term headwinds for the company, which have impacted the market sentiment and drove the share price down from its recent highs in May 2024. The main reason appears to be that the consumer is maxed out due to persistent inflation and high interest rates, from car loans to credit card rates. The consumer is in no position to take any more price increases for consumer and food products. PepsiCo was able to push price increases in 2023 without impacting the volumes, but that changed in 2024. All that said, these things are cyclical and are not going to impact the company in the long term. The share price can still go down from the current levels, so it should be added in multiple lots. SNY (Sanofi): Sanofi is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, based in France. It is also the largest French pharma company. Morningstar puts the fair value at $61 a share, which is nearly 19% above the current price. The company enjoys a strong balance sheet due to a rich pipeline of approved and experimental drugs. The company announced a new strategic policy in 2023, under which it would increase R&D spending and also spin-off or separate the consumer healthcare business unit. Apparently, the market and the dividend-seeking shareholders did not like the idea of increased spending, even though the proposals should benefit the long-term shareholders if the management can bring some faster growth. The company has relatively low debt (roughly $8.5 billion), a strong balance sheet, and a healthy pipeline of current and future drugs, especially in the immunology segment. The current share price offers a good entry point and a very attractive dividend yield. ENB (Enbridge): Enbridge is a midstream energy company based in Canada and serves markets both in Canada and the United States. They operate one of the longest and most complex liquids transportation networks, with over 17,000 miles of pipelines. Enbridge's natural gas pipelines connect supplies to major North American cities and population centers, as well as LNG export facilities. Another subsidiary of Enbridge, Enbridge Gas, will become one of the largest natural gas utilities in North America (after their September 2023 acquisition of Dominion√¢¬Ä¬ôs assets close in 2024). So far this year, the company has closed on two of three utility purchases/ acquisitions from Dominion Energy, while the third should be completed before the end of 2024. However, the results from these acquisitions have yet to show up in the profitability of the company. ENB's focus on utility-like businesses will likely de-risk ENB's profile. The current debt to EBITDA ratio stands at 4.7x, which is right in the middle of ENB's target of maintaining the debt to EBITDA in the range between 4.5x and 5x. The company has paid and grown the dividend at a very respectable pace for 28 years (in Canadian dollars). The dividend payout is fully covered by the DCF (distributable cash flow). In fact, the ratio of dividends to DCF (distributable cash flow) is below 60%, thus quite conservative. Moreover, the current dividend yield, roughly 7.5%, is very attractive. All this bodes well for the investors in terms of the company's ability to continue growing its dividend for the foreseeable future, albeit at a slower pace. Final B-List (High Yield, Moderately Safe): Average yield: 5.30%  (MSFT) (PEP)  (BMY)   (ARCC)  (ENB)  Note 1: Very often, we include a few low-risk stocks in the B-list and C-list. Also, oftentimes, a stock can appear in multiple lists. This is done on purpose. We try to make each of our lists fairly diversified among different sectors/industry segments of the economy. We try to include a few of the highly conservative names in the high-yield list to make the overall group much safer. Table-1B: B-LIST (High Yield) Author In the B-List, the overall risk profile of the group becomes slightly elevated compared to the A-List. That said, the group (as a whole) will likely provide safe dividends for many years. This list offers an average yield for the group of nearly 5.30%, an average of 27 years of dividend history, and an average discount of -12% (from 52-week highs). BMY (Bristol Myers Squibb Co): Bristol's share price has lost nearly 50% since its peak in Dec. 2022, and currently, it appears to be undervalued. It also offers a very nice dividend yield of 5.75% at current prices. Only Pfizer is another major pharma company that offers a higher dividend yield at this time, but it also comes with higher risks. The company is facing several headwinds that include patent expirations, generic threats, decreasing pricing power owing to managed-care constraints, and product liability cases. The Celgene acquisition in 2019 added a large amount of debt to the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs balance sheet, which continues to be a financial risk. That said, the company has reduced its long-term debt by nearly 1/3rd from $48 billion in 2020 to $32 Billion in 2023. BMY is quite adept at making partnerships, deals, and acquisitions. In the process, Bristol has created a strong pipeline and has partnered with other companies to lower the development costs of the new drugs as well as diversify the risks of regulatory failure. They also have a cardiovascular partnership with Pfizer, managing the blockbuster potential of the Eliquis drug. Another recent deal is a licensing deal with SystImmune to bolster BMY's oncology pipeline, which could turn out to be worth multi-billion dollars. BMY increased its quarterly dividend payout early this year from $0.57 a share to $0.60 (a 5.26% increase). In balance, BMY is an attractive buy at the current price and, to some extent, a contrarian turn-around candidate. ARCC (Ares Capital): Ares Capital is one of the largest BDCs (Business Development Companies) in terms of market capitalization and net asset values. ARCC offers a very high yield of roughly 9.2%. Being a BDC, it invests in small and medium-sized companies, some of which may be distressed. ARCC has investments in nearly 500 companies, making it a very diversified portfolio. It has a record of generating a high NII (net Investment income), which currently exceeds $1 billion on an annual basis. Based on core-EPS, its payout ratio is under 81% for the last 12 months, which is respectable for a BDC. Based on the Net Investment Income, it comes out to be 85.7%. The dividend coverage stands at 1.15%. The market for BDCs is getting competitive, and the uncertainty about the interest rates makes their business more challenging, but ARCC is well-positioned to continue performing well. With over 9% dividend yield, there is not much scope left for capital appreciation, but we must remember that this is an investment for income. That said, if someone reinvests all the dividends, the total returns may still be attractive. Final C-LIST (Yield-Hungry, Less Safe): Average yield: 7.78%  (PEP) (MPLX) (ARCC) (BTI) (BCE)  Notes: Note 1: Oftentimes, a stock can appear in multiple lists. We try to include one or two conservative names in the high-yield list to make the overall group much safer. Table-1C: C-LIST (Yield-Hungry, Elevated Risk) Author NOTE: MPLX is structured as a partnership (not a corporation) and issues a K-1 tax form instead of the usual 1099-Div. Please use due diligence. BTI (British American Tobacco) Some investors may not like Tobacco stocks, and that is understandable. But if you are fine with investing in Tobacco stocks, it probably can't get better than this. The current yield is quite high at 9.5%. The company has excelled in growing the new categories of products. However, this is purely an income investment, and we should not expect any significant growth. That said, for income investors, the dividend appears to be reasonably safe. The share price has recovered somewhat from the lows earlier this year. It may be much safer to buy this stock in multiple lots using the dollar-cost-averaging. You may like to read our previous article here, which covered BTI in more detail. BCE (BCE Inc): BCE is the largest communications company in Canada. In many ways, its positives and challenges are similar to those of Verizon (VZ) in the US; however, currently, it is providing a much higher dividend yield than Verizon. BCE is currently paying a very attractive dividend yield of 8.75%. It has paid and raised the dividend payouts consecutively for 15 years (in Canadian dollar terms). It offers a wide range of telecommunications products and services, including wireless, wireline, Broadband, and TV services, to approximately 22 million subscribers in Canada. However, there are some risks that investors should be aware of. It operates in a very competitive environment, and just like other telecom companies in the industry, it carries a large debt burden of nearly $25 billion. We should not expect much growth in the share price, but with over 9% dividend, even a marginal capital appreciation would make it a reasonably good investment. MPLX (MPLX LP): We included ENB from the energy sector in the A-List and B-List. However, to enhance the yield slightly, we are replacing ENB with MPLX in the C-List. First of all, it is a Partnership and issues a K-1 tax form (partnership income) instead of the usual 1099 in case of regular dividends. MPLX is a diversified midstream energy company structured as a master limited partnership. It was formed in 2012 by Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) for the purpose of owning, operating, acquiring, and developing midstream energy infrastructure assets. To date, MPC remains the largest unitholder of MPLX. MPLX maintains a solid balance sheet with investor-grade BBB credit rating and pays a very attractive yield, currently at 8%. It has paid and raised the dividend payout since its inception in 2012 and most recently raised the payout by 9.65% in Nov. 2023. Its dividend is well covered, and dividend coverage stands at 1.6x. Even though, in the last five years, the price appreciation has been significant, we expect limited price appreciation going forward. However, we can expect a very stable and near 8% dividend payout for the foreseeable future. === Apparently, this list (C-List) is for yield-hungry DGI investors. The yield goes up as much as 7.78%. However, this list is not for conservative investors. As you can see, the average credit rating of this set of companies is much lower than the A-List or even B-List. Dividends are moderately safe in this list, but the yields are very attractive. At least a couple of companies in this list come with an elevated level of risk. We urge due diligence to determine if it would suit your personal situation. Nothing comes for free, so there will be more risk involved with this group. That said, it's a highly diversified group spread among five different industry segments. We would like to caution that each company comes with certain risks and concerns. Sometimes, these risks are real, but other times, they may be a bit overblown and temporary. So, it's always recommended to do further research and due diligence. What If We Were to Combine the Three Lists? If we combine the three lists and remove the duplicates (because of combining), we would be left with eleven names. Two-time duplicates: ARCC, ENB, MSFT (3 duplicates). Three-time duplicates: PEP (2 duplicates). After removing these five duplicates, we are left with 10 names. From the energy sector, we have two similar names (ENB and MPLX). We keep ENB and remove MPLX (since MPLX is a partnership). We also have two stocks from Healthcare; we keep SNY and remove BMY. The combined list is highly diversified in as many as eight industry segments. The stats for the group of 8 are as follows: Average yield: 5.71% Average discount (from 52WK High): -10.4% Average 5-yr dividend growth: 6.84% Average 10-yr dividend growth: 8.08% (from five names) Average Payout Ratio: 63.69% Average Total Quality Score: 71.88 Table 2: Author Conclusion In the first week of every month, we start with a fairly large list of dividend-paying stocks and filter our way down to just a handful of stocks that meet our selection criteria and income goals. In this article, we have presented three groups of stocks (five each) with different goals in mind to suit the varying needs of a wider audience. Even though the risk profile of each group is different, each group in itself is fairly balanced and diversified.  This month, the first group yields 3.61%, while the second group elevates the yield to 5.30%. We also presented a C-list for yield-hungry investors with a 7.78% yield. The combined group (all three lists combined with duplication removed) offers an even more diversified group with eight positions and a 5.71% yield. High Income DIY Portfolios: The primary goal of ""High Income DIY Portfolios"" Marketplace service is high income with low risk and preservation of capital. It provides DIY investors with vital information and portfolio/asset allocation strategies to help create stable, long-term passive income with sustainable yields. The portfolios are designed for Income-Investors (including retirees or near-retirees). We provide seven portfolios: 3 buy-and-hold, 3 Rotational portfolios, and 3-Bucket NPP Model Portfolio. This includes two High-Income portfolios, two DGI portfolios, and a conservative NPP strategy portfolio with low drawdowns and high growth.

wdXWkWQruKwsSyK,Seeking Alpha,bing,"Earnings Season Launches With Delta, PepsiCo, JPMorgan, And Citi Leading Off",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702627-earnings-season-launches-with-delta-pepsico-jpmorgan-and-citi-leading-off,2024-07-06 10:01,2024-07-06 10:15,UBER,,"Get ahead of the market by subscribing to Seeking Alpha's Stocks to Watch, a preview of key events scheduled for the coming week. The newsletter keeps you informed of the biggest stories set to make headlines, including upcoming IPOs, investor days, earnings reports and conference presentations. The major focus of the markets for the first full week of the third quarter will be the June CPI report and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony to committees in the Senate and House. The CPI print is forecast to show a 0.1% month-over-month rise in inflation, while the annual core inflation rate is expected to be unchanged at 3.4%. Bank of America expects the June CPI report to be another confidence builder following the ""undeniably good"" May report. The firm noted that rent and owners' equivalent rent increases should cool in the coming months, which should add to the Fed's confidence in the inflation outlook. BNP Paribas highlighted that auto insurance and air fares could also trickle lower. The earnings season officially begins with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) heading into the earnings confessional, along with major banks such as Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC). The event calendar includes Tyson Foods' (NYSE:TSN) Demo Day for startups, Samsung's (OTCPK:SSNLF) Unpacked Galaxy event, and the Allen Conference in Sun Valley. Meanwhile, the auto sector is expected to create more headlines as the battle between the European Union and Chinese electric vehicle companies ramps up and Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF) workers in South Korea threaten to strike. Tesla (TSLA) shares are also in the spotlight due to the recent spike after the company posted a better-than-feared Q2 deliveries report.  Earnings spotlight: Monday, July 8 - Greenbrier (GBX). See the full earnings calendar. Earnings spotlight: Tuesday, July 9 - Helen of Troy (HELE) and Kura Sushi (KRUS). See the full earnings calendar. Earnings spotlight: Wednesday, July 10 - Manchester United (MANU) and PriceSmart (PSMT). See the full earnings calendar. Earnings spotlight: Thursday, July 11 - Delta Air Lines (DAL), PepsiCo (PEP), and Conagra Brands (CAG). See the full earnings calendar. Earnings spotlight: Friday, July 12 - Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), and Wells Fargo (WFC). See the full earnings calendar. Volatility watch: Options trading volume is elevated on Faraday Future Intelligent (FFIE) and Conn's (CONN). The most overbought stocks per their 14-day relative strength index include Spectral Capital (OTCPK:FCCN), Bio Essence (OTCPK:BIOE), and Simply Better Brands (OTCQB:SBBCF). The most oversold stocks per their 14-day Relative Strength Index include Thunder Power (AIEV), SolarEdge (SEDG), and Sonoco (SON). Short interest is high on Hertz Global (HTZ), Carvana (CVNA), and Cinemark Holdings (CNK) heading into next week's action IPO watch: There are no new IPOs expected to begin trading during the week. The IPO lockup period expires on a block of shares of Smith Douglas Homes (SDHC). The quiet period expires on Tempus AI (NASDAQ:TEM) to free up analysts to post ratings. At the time of publication, Tempus AI traded about 15% below where the IPO was priced. Dividend watch: Companies that have an ex-dividend date coming next week include JPMorgan (JPM) and Progressive (PGR). The five stocks in the S&P 500 Index with the highest dividend yields are Ford Motor (F), Amcor (AMCR), Hasbro (HAS), Best Buy (BBY), and International Paper (IP). Read through some of the dividend stock picks from Seeking Alpha analysts. Delta Air Lines earnings preview: Delta Air Lines (DAL) is due to report earnings on July 11. The airline company is looking to build off its strong financial results for Q1, when it delivered record revenue and earnings at the high end of its guidance. Heading into the report, Delta (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian has noted that demand for air travel remains strong, with the customer base in a healthy financial position and travel being a top priority. In general, Delta (DAL) continues to benefit from a premium consumer mix as a best-in-class operator, with diversified revenue and cash streams. Analysts are looking for Delta (DAL) to reiterate its 2024 guidance for EPS of $6.00 to $7.00 and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. A positive or negative surprise from Delta (DAL) with its guidance update could be a share price catalyst for the airline sector in general. Options trading implies a share price swing of 6% after Delta's (DAL) report is dropped. Shares of Delta (DAL) fell 2.3% after the company's last earnings report. United Airlines (UAL), Copa Holdings (CPA), and Alaska Air (ALK) are the three airline stocks that correlate the closest to Delta after its earnings report is released. PepsiCo earnings preview: PepsiCo (PEP) will report Q2 earnings on July 11. Consensus estimates from analysts are for revenue of $22.7 billion to be disclosed, EPS of $2.16, adjusted operating margin of 17.6%, and adjusted EBITDA of $4.72 billion. Organic sales are seen rising by 3.0%, led by a strong performance in the Europe and Latin America regions. Volume is seen as being up 4.1% to offset a 1.1% decline in pricing. UBS noted that although the stock has largely traded sideways to start the year and the firm's crowding analysis points to PepsiCo being a crowded long, conversations would suggest sentiment remains negative heading into results due to concerns about challenging U.S. trends. ""We do not expect 2Q results to represent a meaningful positive catalyst, with many investors taking a wait-and-see approach whether top- and bottom-line trends can show improvement. However, longer-term, we see a path to improved performance from here, and view the current entry point as attractive,"" updated the UBS analyst team. On Seeking Alpha, Empyrean Research is also cautious on PepsiCo (PEP) due in part to the continued overhang of GLP-1 and Russia risks.  Investor events: The five-day Allen Conference will take place in Sun Valley, Idaho, next week.

Following an analysis of the sector's financial performance in 2023, the non-profit said this week that private payers serving the federally funded program generated a gross margin of $1,982 per member in 2023. In contrast, the Medicaid program, jointly funded by the states and the federal government, recorded the lowest gross margin of $753 per enrollee, while individual and employer markets posted per-member gross margins of $1,048 and $910, respectively.  Medicare Advantage is a growing managed care market served by publicly traded health insurers such as UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), Humana (NYSE:HUM), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Alignment Healthcare (NASDAQ:ALHC), and Clover Health (CLOV). Major operators in the Medicaid market include Centene (CNC), Elevance Health (ELV), and Molina Healthcare (MOH), while Cigna (CI) mainly serves commercial insurance. KFF used data from the Health Coverage Portal, a health plan performance database run by healthcare analytics firm Mark Farrah Associates, for its analysis. However, its review had certain limitations, as it did not include data from the U.S. territories and only partially included Medicaid data from Arizona, California, Delaware, New York, and Oregon.  The report indicates how private health insurers perform financially as they play an increasingly dominant role in Medicare and Medicaid. According to federal data, private Medicare Advantage plans serve more than half of eligible Medicare beneficiaries, while Medicaid managed care plans (typically private insurers) cover about three-quarters of the program's membership. Despite concerns over a recent spike in demand for medical care among Medicare enrollees, KFF said the gross margin in the Medicare Advantage market remained largely similar to that in 2022. In January, Humana (HUM) shares sold off after the company cut its outlook twice early this year, citing higher than anticipated medical costs in its Medicare Advantage business. The report also sheds light on a key industry performance metric called the medical loss ratio, which measures the share of premiums health insurers pay for members' medical costs. According to KFF, individual insurance plans recorded the lowest medical loss ratio of 84% in 2023, while Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care markets recorded 87%, the industry's highest. Employer plans fell in between, recording 86%.

EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), one of the top movers this week, also buoyed the market between Monday and Friday. The benchmark S&P 500 index (SP500) had its best weekly performance since late April. Here is a look at some of the trending stocks this week: Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARAA) (NASDAQ:PARA) rallied +15% this week after several media outlets reported late Tuesday that the media company came to agreement on preliminary terms to merge with Skydance Media, a deal that had fallen apart last month. Skydance would pay $1.75B for National Amusements, which owns 77% of the voting shares of Paramount, as per the tentative deal, Reuters reported citing sources. Tesla's (TSLA) stock climbed +26% and erased its YTD losses, putting the stock on track to turn positive for 2024 on Friday. The surge came after the EV maker reported deliveries for the second quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. EV stocks in general saw an upswing as investors welcomed Tesla's (TSLA) strong delivery report and Rivian√¢¬Ä¬ôs (RIVN) partnership with Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF). Polestar Automotive (PSNY) +22%, Li Auto (LI) +13%, NIO (NIO) +6.2%, Lucid Group (LCID) +9.3%, XPeng (XPEV) +6.3% all registered notable gains. Crypto stocks experienced a volatile week, as bitcoin (BTC-USD) slumped below $58K on Thursday for the first time in two months. The drop stemmed from concerns over defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox distributing a large amount of BTC to its creditors. The German government also moved its stash of BTC to crypto exchanges. Bit Digital (BTBT) moved +5%, Cipher Mining (CIFR) +11.6%, Riot Platforms (RIOT) +5% and MicroStrategy (MSTR) -15.6%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) came in spotlight after Bloomberg News reported that chief global markets strategist Marko Kolanovic was planning to leave the bank. As per an internal memo, Kolanovic, who according to his LinkedIn profile has been at JPMorgan (JPM) for over 16 years, is ""exploring other opportunities."" Kolanovic also served as co-head of JPMorgan's (JPM) global research. The memo said Hussein Malik will now become the sole head. Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) fell -11%, continuing the declines seen since a short rally at the beginning of the week after Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty, revealed a stake in the company. Gains made early on Monday were quickly erased and Roaring Kitty was hit by a class-action lawsuit later in the week claiming securities fraud over the volatility seen in GameStop (GME) shares in May and June. DJT Trump Media & Technology (NASDAQ:DJT) stock retreated -26% over the week. The social media firm controlled by former U.S. President Donald Trump was in the news this week after it said it was buying substantially all assets of WorldConnect Technologies to power its planned TV streaming service. The company also raised more than $105M in cumulative proceeds via the cash exercise of warrants. More on this week's trending stocks  Is Tesla An AI Robotics Company?

Learning how to manage your credit responsibly so you don‚Äôt overspend takes time, experience, and discipline.Consider: 7 Appliances Frugal Homeowners Steer Clear OfExplore: 6 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)Many people use their rewards credit card for everyday spending ‚Äî things like gas and groceries that they would buy anyway. But it‚Äôs easy to overspend when you use plastic.It might be easier to earn credit card rewards by charging big-ticket purchases and using cash for everyday spending. If you have enough money in savings to pay the bill in full by the due date, the rewards will add up quickly, and you won‚Äôt end up paying interest on one too many coffees.Energy-Efficient Home AppliancesWhen your dishwasher or refrigerator breaks beyond repair, you‚Äôll have to replace it. You might decide to replace all your kitchen appliances at the same time, so you‚Äôll still have a matching set. Plus, you can often save money by bundling your refrigerator, microwave, range, and dishwasher as a package.According to HomeGuide.com, the average appliance package costs between $2,100 and $5,400. If you have a card that delivers 2% rewards, you‚Äôll earn $42 to $108 back. If you replace older, less efficient appliances with Energy Star-rated models, you‚Äôll also save money on your electric bill.Also: 5 Expensive Costco Items To Buy Online on Amazon Instead4K Smart TVAmazon currently offers 50-inch Samsung 4K Smart TVs for as low as $350. However, if you want a larger or higher-quality model, you‚Äôll still pay thousands. If you use your Amazon Prime Visa on a $2,100 smart TV, you‚Äôll earn 5%, or $105, cash back.Plus, it‚Äôs smart to use a rewards card on high-priced electronics because most credit cards carry purchase protection in case your device breaks.Refundable Airline TicketsIt pays to book your next flight using a travel rewards credit card. You can increase your earnings if you book through the travel portal affiliated with your credit card. For instance, if you pay for travel through Chase Travel with the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, you‚Äôll get 5 points back for every dollar spent. When you have enough points, you can redeem those points through Chase Travel for your next trip, and they are worth 25% more, according to GOBankingRates‚Äô review of the card.Refundable Hotel RoomsSimilarly, it pays to book your hotel room with a rewards credit card. When you check into a hotel, the hotel typically puts a deposit of anywhere from $50 to $100 or more per day on your card. If you don‚Äôt spend that money on incidentals within the hotel, it can take 7 to 10 days for the money to be returned to your account. If you use a debit card, that ties up your cash for more than a week.Story continuesCar TiresTires for your car are a big-ticket purchase that you may not think about. You can find the best deals on tires, with free installation, at BJ‚Äôs or Costco warehouse clubs. In addition to saving money, why not earn cash back by using your rewards credit card? The BJ‚Äôs One Mastercard from Capital One delivers 3% in BJ‚Äôs rewards on every purchase at the club. That‚Äôs $30 you can use to spend on your next shopping trip if your tires cost $1,000.A Few Points to RememberLeveraging credit card rewards on big-ticket purchases can put cash in your pocket. If you only use your credit cards for larger, one-off purchases, there‚Äôs less chance you will lose track of your credit card spending. You can avoid interest if you pay your balance in full by the due date, so only spend money you already have.Keep in mind that it‚Äôs always a good idea not to charge more than 30% of your available credit on a card each month. Your credit utilization plays a big role in your credit score.More From GOBankingRatesI'm Retired and Regret My Frugal Retirement -- Here's WhyI Rent Out a Home on Airbnb: Here's How Much Profit I Actually Bring In5 Genius Things People With Healthy Savings Do5 Myths About Debt That Nobody Should Believe in 2024This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Big Expenses Worth Charging on Credit To Get RewardsView comments",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

QW6xBYWevU9oZ9F,Techcrunch,google,You could learn a lot from a CIO with a $17B IT budget,https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/06/you-could-learn-a-lot-from-a-cio-with-a-15b-it-budget/,2024-07-06 14:00,2024-07-06 14:02,AMZN,,"Lori Beer, global CIO at JPMorgan Chase, oversees a massive IT operation that‚Äôs bigger than many companies. It involves a 63,000-person team worldwide and a $17 billion yearly budget (at last count), which was about 10% of JPMorgan‚Äôs overall revenue last year. It‚Äôs moving $10 trillion (that‚Äôs a 10 with 12 zeros after it) every single day and is the largest U.S. bank in terms of deposits and online customers.That‚Äôs serious scale involving massive cloud infrastructure services, on-prem data centers, mobile infrastructure, and other assorted digital technology just to run the transactions part of the bank, never mind the rest of the business. It requires a person with tremendous attention to detail to make sure it‚Äôs running smoothly, securely and efficiently.‚ÄúIf you think about just our markets business, the high-speed, real-time processing of those types of things where fractions of seconds matter, that‚Äôs all technology driven,‚Äù she said.It takes a huge amount of money and requires building front-end services for customers and back-end services for the company. It needs on-prem data centers and cloud services. It requires innovative startups and reliable, established companies. It demands an operating budget to run in the present and an innovation budget that looks forward to what‚Äôs coming.It‚Äôs a case study for every CIO out there, most of whom will never come close to JPMorgan Chase‚Äôs scale but who can still learn from how it goes about its business.Tracking a huge tech ecosystem‚ÄúWe move $10 trillion a day, and we‚Äôve seen growth in that business. So there is a direct correlation to our tech investments, our products and services, our tech. So there‚Äôs just the normal business growth, and then there‚Äôs the continued optimization of how we use infrastructure and things like that,‚Äù Beer told TechCrunch.Unsurprisingly, the company is looking at how AI can help manage all this and provide a better customer experience, adding another layer of complexity that every CIO is dealing with these days.‚ÄúThen, of course, there‚Äôs the new technologies. I mean, AI ‚Äî as you well know, you wrote about it ‚Äî is great and is driving a whole new set of volume-driven, compute-related costs, and we‚Äôre leaning hard into that,‚Äù she said.When she speaks, she resembles in some ways Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. When he was in charge of Amazon Web Services, he had an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the company‚Äôs large number of products and services and would speak about them in great detail as though he were seeing a screen in front of him with the information. Beer is the same way, talking about her company‚Äôs highly complex technology ecosystem with ease and ticking off all the different areas she has to track and be aware of.That‚Äôs an important aspect of her role: understanding the interconnectedness of all the different parts of her IT budget and how each one affects the others as she builds and maintains the bank‚Äôs vast technology stack.‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt really start talking about AI if you‚Äôre not in the cloud, if you‚Äôre not modernizing your data, if you‚Äôre not doing all the foundational stuff,‚Äù she said. That has put the bank on an aggressive modernization journey based on a hybrid strategy. Some of the more critical services are running on prem in very sophisticated data centers the company built to handle its unique demands, and some are running in the cloud with the main cloud vendors: Amazon, Microsoft and Google.And she actually made sure JPMorgan was well set up for generative AI several years before it burst into the mainstream, making sure the company had its data house in order so it could work with large language models. ‚ÄúIt was over three years ago that we laid out an AI data strategy and AI strategy,‚Äù she said. That involved forming an operating committee to align the data strategy and cloud strategy in part because the most advanced data management capabilities are in the cloud. ‚ÄúSo we sort of got a bit ahead of that train,‚Äù she said.Setting up resilient systemsWhen you have such a sprawling IT infrastructure, it‚Äôs more important than ever to have systems of control in place to help manage it all. That requires a framework and a way of working with every service the company provides.‚ÄúFirst and foremost, we have to think about it in the context of: What is the resiliency standard, the essential service, that I need to provide. In some cases, if I have an application or workload that‚Äôs not an essential service, moving to the cloud is a lot easier, right? If I have something that requires the highest [level] of resiliency, maybe I run those things in my highly efficient, highly effective, highly protected data centers,‚Äù she said.That means working with the engineers, developers and IT professionals to help them understand the way the company works and adhering to a set of clearly defined standards. ‚ÄúWe continue to teach our teams to understand, whether it‚Äôs on prem or in the cloud, teaching the engineers how to be accountable for the cost, the security, the scalability and the efficiency of how we build software and leverage infrastructure.‚ÄùThe company also works with a number of startups to tap into their innovations; Beer has a whole team dedicated to looking for the next big things. ‚ÄúThe reason that‚Äôs important is we‚Äôre so big, at such size and scale, and their whole job is to constantly look at new companies, the evolution of companies, and so at any point in time, we probably have like 200 POCs [proofs of concept] going on. We are continuing to test and learn and we‚Äôre in a position to be able to do best in breed, whether it‚Äôs cyber technology or something else,‚Äù she said.For Beer, every decision has to involve a timeline to value. Projects with more immediacy have a timeline of one to three years, while projects that require more time to bake get a three- to five-year time horizon. That could include things like the blockchain, AI and even quantum computing, as the company looks for any edge it can get in terms of services provided and efficiencies it can gain.‚ÄúWe also have to invest in the next horizon, things that are adding value, things where maybe the value is uncertain, but we have to keep looking forward, and we really try to balance our investments across those things.‚Äù",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

These biotechs will ""will receive significant attention in 2024"" as a way to fill pipeline gaps in the second half of the decade, according to PwC. ""Competition for truly innovative assets remains intense,"" according to a recent PwC piece entitled ""Global M&A Trends in Health Industries. ""At the same time, companies are continually reviewing their portfolios for divestiture candidates that could unlock value and provide capital to deploy on new acquisitions."" Citing the growth of GLP-1 weight loss drugs such as Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy (semagludide) and Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) Zepbound (tirzepatide), PwC Germany Global Health Industries Deals Leader Christian Moldt noted that ""Biotech companies that can innovate in this space, especially those focused on providing an oral method of administration, will be highly sought after."" Both companies are developing oral weight loss therapies. Lilly's, in phase 3, is known as orforglipron. Novo released phase 3 data on a 50 mg oral version of semaglutide in 2023 and phase 1 data on amycretin, a co-agonist of GLP-1 and amylin, in March of this year. Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX) has been the target of takeover speculation following positive phase 2 data of its oral GLP-1/GIP agonist VK2735 released in late February. It has the same mechanism of action as Zepbound. Moldt added that he does not anticipate seeing any megadeals that would combine large pharmas this year. He also said that large pharmas are motivated to divest non-core or low-growth assets ""to help generate cash to advance new investments that align more closely with their core competencies."" Biotech, however, is not the only health care industry that could see an upswing in M&A activity. Moldt said that consumer health product demand is rising due to an aging population and higher incomes. ""Companies specialising in consumer health areas will likely remain attractive acquisition targets in 2024 because recently spun-off pure-play over-the-counter drug and consumer health businesses are expected to use transactions to accelerate their own growth and transformation plans,"" he wrote.

Those who complete all 10 transactions in time will get their bonus within 15 days.Should you go for it?These bonuses can sound really appealing, especially when they require so little cash. But remember that you'll have the account long after you've earned the bonus.

KmyeV0o7TRJxsEJ,Techcrunch,google,"How to set up parental controls on Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and more popular sites",https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/06/how-to-set-up-parental-controls-on-facebook-snapchat-tiktok-and-more-popular-sites/,2024-07-06 15:15,2024-07-06 15:17,META,,"Parental controls are offered by almost every popular media network, but many parents aren‚Äôt aware of them. Fewer than 10% of teens on Instagram had enabled parental control settings by the end of 2022 and only a single-digit percentage of parents had used the controls, according to a Washington Post report from earlier this year. In response to concerns from Congress and rights groups about the potential harm social media inflicts on young users, tech companies have long argued that parental controls they offer protect kids. But because the parental controls aren‚Äôt on by default, they do little to protect users unless parents actually enable them.Each platform approaches parental controls a bit differently, but most of them start by allowing parents to monitor who their teen is communicating with. Some social media platforms then go a bit further by allowing parents to intervene in how their teen uses an app.TikTok appears to be the platform that gives parents the most control over their teens‚Äô usage. The ByteDance-owned company has faced significant scrutiny from lawmakers, arguably more so than any other platform in this list. In an attempt to win over lawmakers, the app offers parental controls that are much more advanced than those on Instagram, Snapchat and others.¬†And while most social media platforms offer some sort of parental controls, some have had them for longer than others. Meta has faced scrutiny for its potential negative effect on teens and young users for over a decade, which is why it‚Äôs had parental controls for many years, whereas a platform like Discord has been able to fly under the radar and has only recently introduced parental controls.¬†Before getting into the controls, it‚Äôs important to recognize that teens can also create secret accounts, and that most of the parental controls on social networks rely on communication from both the parents and their teen.¬†We‚Äôve created this guide to make it easier for parents to navigate and understand the parental controls offered by popular social media companies, and we‚Äôve detailed how they vary from platform to platform.¬†How Instagram‚Äôs parental controls work¬†Image Credits: InstagramMeta-owned Instagram offers parental controls through its Family Center offering. The social network gives users the option to create a ‚Äúsupervised account‚Äù for teens between the ages of 13 and 17. Both the teen and parent must agree to participate.¬†In the Family Center, parents and guardians can supervise their teen‚Äôs account by seeing how much time they‚Äôre spending on the social network. Parents can intervene in their teen‚Äôs usage of the app by setting daily time limits or adding scheduled breaks.¬†With this feature, parents can make sure their teen is only spending a certain amount of time on the app and isn‚Äôt using it during homework or school time. They can also see their teen‚Äôs following and followers lists in order to monitor who can view their posts and message them. Parents can also see any reports that their teen has submitted to Instagram.¬†Plus, parents can see their teen‚Äôs account privacy settings and sensitive content settings, along with their DM settings.¬†They can discuss these settings with their teen to help ensure they are protected. TikTok offers robust parental controlsImage Credits: TikTokLike Instagram, TikTok lets parents link their account to their teen‚Äôs with its ‚ÄúFamily Pairing‚Äù feature. After doing so, parents can decide how much time their teen can spend on the app each day. They can set their teen‚Äôs screen time limit and get a summary of how much time their teen spends on the app.¬†The app also lets parents mute their teen‚Äôs push notifications (TikTok mutes notifications for teens between the ages of 13 and15 from 9 p.m. to 8 a.m. by default). Parents can also choose to pause their teens‚Äô notifications for a custom amount of time.TikTok lets parents take an additional step that other platforms on this list don‚Äôt: Parents can limit specific types of content. They have the option to select keywords or hashtags to exclude specific content from their teen‚Äôs For You and Following feeds. They can also enable a ‚ÄúRestricted Mode‚Äù that will automatically restrict their teen‚Äôs exposure to unsuitable or inappropriate content.¬†In addition, parents can decide whether their teen can search for videos, hashtags or live videos. Plus, they can control whether their teen‚Äôs account can be recommended to others on the app. Parents can decide who can comment on their teens‚Äô videos and who can view the content they like.¬†In terms of DMs, parents can restrict who can message their teen or turn off direct messaging altogether. It‚Äôs worth noting that DMs on TikTok are only available to accounts belonging to users who are 16 and older.How to set Snapchat‚Äôs parental controlsImage Credits: SnapchatSnapchat offers parents access to a ‚ÄúFamily Center‚Äù that lets them monitor some of their teen‚Äôs activity on the app. Parents have to create their own Snapchat accounts and then connect it with their teen‚Äôs.Once parents pair the two accounts, they can see who their child is friends with on Snapchat. They can also get a glimpse of who they‚Äôve messaged in the last seven days. Plus, parents can see a complete list of members in Groups that their teen has been active in over the last week.¬†It‚Äôs worth noting that parents can‚Äôt see the messages their teen has shared; they can only see a list of people that their teen has recently messaged.¬†Like on TikTok, parents can limit their teen‚Äôs ability to view sensitive content in Stories and Spotlight.¬†If parents come across an account that they‚Äôre concerned about, they can report it to Snapchat‚Äôs Trust and Safety team.¬†However, unlike on TikTok and Instagram, parents can‚Äôt monitor or limit much time their child is spending on the app.How to set up Discord‚Äôs parental controlsImage Credits: DiscordDiscord offers a ‚ÄúFamily Center‚Äù that lets parents monitor their child‚Äôs activity on the platform. After enrolling in Family Center, parents receive a weekly email summary containing information about their teen‚Äôs activity. Although parents will be able to see which Discord communities and users their teens are talking to, they won‚Äôt be able to see the contents of the conversations themselves.Parents can see their teen‚Äôs recently added friends, including their display names and avatars. They can also see which users their teen has messaged or called in direct or group messages, including the times of the last message or call.¬†Plus, parents can see which servers their teen joined or participated in, including server icons, and server member counts.Although Discord is regularly used by a young audience, the platform was until recently largely left out of the conversation around social networks and their potential to harm children. In the past, Discord was able to sit on the sidelines while Congress grilled Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and Facebook. However, Discord was asked to testify in Congress‚Äô most recent hearing on child exploitation.How to use Facebook‚Äôs parental controlsImage Credits: MetaYou may be surprised to see Facebook on this list because it‚Äôs largely known for being a social network for older people. However, while it may seem like teens aren‚Äôt using Facebook, recent reports suggest that young people are still using the Meta-owned platform.¬†Parents can access Facebook‚Äôs supervision controls in the same place they monitor their child‚Äôs activity on Instagram.

dXicprr2wbVVXyr,BBC,bing,UEFA Euro 2024 England 1 Switzerland 1 Penalty shootout,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/crgkevjm6zmt?page=22,2024-07-06 15:16,2024-07-06 15:26,F,,"Watch on BBC One, iPlayer and online (UK only)Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds and online (UK only)Quarter-final into penalty shootoutEmbolo prods home opener after break but Saka levelsWinners will face Netherlands or Turkey in semi-final England stepped back from the brink of a Euro 2024 exit again as they secured a semi-final place with victory over Switzerland on penalties in Dusseldorf.Gareth Southgate√¢¬Ä¬ôs side, who were rescued by Jude Bellingham√¢¬Ä¬ôs spectacular late equaliser in the last 16 against Slovakia, were in trouble once more when Breel Embolo stole in at the far post to put Switzerland ahead with only 15 minutes left.Bukayo Saka then produced a moment of individual brilliance of the sort England have relied on heavily throughout the tournament to equalise with a fierce low shot five minutes later.Extra time failed to find a winner, England going through with a set of flawless penalties after goalkeeper Jordan Pickford saved Manuel Akanji√¢¬Ä¬ôs first spot-kick.Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Saka and Ivan Toney were all successful before substitute Trent Alexander-Arnold hammered home the decisive penalty in front of England√¢¬Ä¬ôs delirious supporters. England have advanced to the Euro 2024 semi-finals almost by stealth, producing another lifeless performance here and going behind before digging themselves out of a hole to win.Southgate was finally able to celebrate victory in his 100th game in charge but only after another agonising 120 minutes and an anxious period when it looked like England were going out.It was a particularly sweet moment for Liverpool√¢¬Ä¬ôs Alexander-Arnold to strike the decisive penalty, having been dropped from his experimental midfield role after their second game, against Denmark, then being overlooked when Southgate decided to use wing-backs.England√¢¬Ä¬ôs new three-at-the-back strategy looked more comfortable for the players but against the well-organised and confident Swiss, lacked threat just as much as Southgate√¢¬Ä¬ôs previous plans.As with Bellingham√¢¬Ä¬ôs equaliser 86 seconds from the end of normal time against Slovakia, Saka√¢¬Ä¬ôs shot to keep England alive was their first on target of the match.England, ultimately, will not care as it was a case of job done but there is surely a limit to how often they can make life difficult for themselves before they get off the hook.Saka√¢¬Ä¬ôs goal was just reward for a man-of-the-match display, while Aston Villa√¢¬Ä¬ôs Ezri Konsa was impeccable in defence as deputy for suspended Marc Guehi.Kobbie Mainoo also excelled in midfield but it remains a mystery why an England side so packed with attacking riches looks so impotent for so long √¢¬Ä¬ì something Southgate will have to solve before their semi-final against either the Netherlands or Turkey in Dortmund.For now, however, England can celebrate living on their nerves but staying alive at Euro 2024. England manager Southgate was so confident in his collection of penalty takers that he felt able to remove captain and spot-kick expert Harry Kane from the fray with 11 minutes of extra time left.Kane, who was off the pace throughout, had taken a heavy knock then fallen awkwardly into the dugout before Southgate sent on Toney.Toney√¢¬Ä¬ôs penalty expertise has been on show in the Premier League for Brentford, so when it came to penalties, Southgate had an impressive group to seal a semi-final place and the striker did not disappoint.Palmer - labelled √¢¬Ä¬úCool√¢¬Ä¬ù Palmer for his nerveless approach from 12 yards at Chelsea - set England on their way before Bellingham, Saka, Arsenal√¢¬Ä¬ôs penalty taker, and Toney set the stage for Alexander-Arnold√¢¬Ä¬ôs thunderous finale.It will give Southgate a feeling of security in these nail-biting situations to have those specialists to call on.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ford (F) has gained only ~7% YTD, while GM (GM) has rallied over 29% compared to the ~17% rise in the S&P 500 (SPY). ""Underperformance by one of America's two largest automakers relative to the other doesn't happen very often,"" Barron's wrote, adding that the duo is not highly dissimilar in financials, but investors have yet to recognize that. However, for one underperformer to close the gap, ""there just needs to be a catalyst,"" the publication said, arguing that capital discipline would be the key to that transformation. Anticipated special dividends worth up to $2.60 a share, less spending on EVs, an increased focus on quality, and, therefore, a reduction of warranty expenses would also help the narrative. A thriving auto market in the U.S. will also be a tailwind, with Americans expected to buy 16M new cars in 2024, up from roughly 15.5M in 2024. ""Add it all up, and trimming the capital budget might be the best sign Ford is getting serious about its stock price. Investors should, too,"" Barron's argued. However, according to Seeking Alpha's Quant System, Wall Street analysts, and Seeking Alpha analysts, Ford (F) remains at a hold. SA analyst Manuel Paul Dipold issued a sell rating on Ford (F) this week, arguing that its most important market, the U.S., is ""stagnating"" and that its valuation is cheap only in terms of non-GAAP measures.

The jump continued a broad uptrend for the semiconductor technology expert, adding up to a 117.7% gain in the first half of the year.Arm's gains are driven by the ongoing frenzy for advanced artificial intelligence (AI) software and the hardware that makes those apps tick. And Arm investors are also paying close attention to the global and American economies.Analyst ratings and economic trendsThe enthusiasm for AI technologies has significantly boosted investor interest in companies involved in AI hardware. While the AI success of Nvidia (NVDA -1.91%) and AMD (AMD 4.88%) doesn't directly lean on ARM architectures -- they primarily use their proprietary platforms instead -- Arm benefits indirectly from the AI boom. The positive market sentiment toward AI advancements continues to propel Arm's stock upwards. Furthermore, the company's former focus on low-power embedded and mobile chips is changing before your eyes. These days, you'll find Arm-based chips all over modern data centers and PC systems.Arm's stock received notable boosts from several analyst upgrades in June. At least two leading analyst firms raised their target prices on Arm stock last month, citing strong revenue growth and potential market share gains against the likes of Nvidia and AMD. These bullish endorsements reinforced investor confidence in Arm's growth prospects, resulting in mild price gains along the way.The broader market dynamics also played a role in Arm's June rise. A softer-than-expected jobs report in May fueled hopes for potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which would benefit growth stocks. The semiconductor sector is full of growth stories, including Arm. This positive macroeconomic backdrop created a helpful environment for Arm's stock to flourish.Strategic industry developmentsIndustry news also contributed to Arm's strong performance. Reports that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.82%) was investing in extreme ultraviolet lithography suggested a robust demand for next-generation chip technologies. As TSMC is a leading manufacturer of Arm-based chips, this investment indicated a positive outlook for Arm's future growth.Arm's strategic positioning in the AI ecosystem highlights its potential for sustained growth. The company's advanced v9 architecture and its power-efficient processor platforms are increasingly interesting to major industry players, strengthening Arm's competitive edge in the semiconductor market.Finally, Arm also earned a rare market accolade last month. The stock was added to the Nasdaq-100 Index on June 24. This prestigious index, which informs the popular Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ 1.04%) and other Nasdaq-tracking exchange-traded funds, comprises the top 100 largest and most actively traded companies on the Nasdaq stock exchange.Arm's rapid inclusion in the index after an initial public offering last September reminds investors of its growing importance in the global technology ecosystem. As CEO Rene Haas highlighted in that announcement, this achievement validates Arm's business strategy and its critical role in providing foundational compute solutions for AI workloads.Watch Arm's stock closely, but hold off on buying itThe stock isn't cheap these days. Whether you measure the valuation by price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, or price-to-free cash flow ratios, Arm's stock almost always makes Nvidia and AMD look affordable by comparison. In other words, Arm isn't a value investor's favorite AI pick. Even die-hard growth investors might want to take it easy with this red-hot stock at the moment. In my eyes, Arm is the kind of AI stock that could serve your portfolio well in the long run -- from a lower starting price.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

ceoeyknkyPa0qbc,Seeking Alpha,google,Abbott Laboratories (ABT): The Fantastic Mix Of Growth And Value - At A Great Price,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702736-abbott-laboratories-the-fantastic-mix-of-growth-and-value-at-a-great-price?utm_source=news.google.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,2024-07-07 03:22,2024-07-07 03:30,ABT,,"hapabapa Introduction Bloomberg hit the nail on the head when it wrote: ""High-Priced S&P 500 Powers Head Untroubled by Political Stress.""  Essentially, the market went back to doing what it does best, which is betting on the Fed easing rates going forward. This allowed it to ignore poor employment numbers, construction in the services industry, and weakness in manufacturing sentiment. The S&P 500 gained 2% in the week, the most since April, as data showing a contraction in services industries and an uptick in the unemployment rate reinforced optimism on rate cuts. Ten-year Treasury yields, which initially spiked after Biden√¢¬Ä¬ôs disastrous June 27 performance spurred wagers that Trump√¢¬Ä¬ôs return to office would herald looser fiscal policy, erased the increase, as did the dollar, falling for the first week since May. - Bloomberg   Bloomberg Don't get me wrong. I'm not ""hating."" I know I may sound incredibly bearish when I write stuff like this. I don't have any shorts. In fact, I don't even have cash after my latest investment. This is all about the risk/reward. Although we can make the case that stock market valuations are horrible tools for market timing, the current situation hints that we may need to lower our expectations, regardless of what happens in November (or in general). Currently, the S&P 500 trades at 26x earnings, which is higher than any election since at least 1990.   Bloomberg Again, this doesn't mean the market is toast - especially not because these valuations are driven by fewer than ten mega-cap ""tech"" stocks. What this means is that I'm looking for opportunities elsewhere, which includes other areas with secular growth and companies that haven't done so well recently. One of them is Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). The medical devices giant with a $180 billion market cap has been disappointing since its stock price peak in 4Q21. Back then, the pandemic ended, leaving COVID-19 winners in the dust. While weakness is deserved after the valuation started to run red-hot, I have become a big believer in the potential this Dividend King brings to the table. My most recent article was written on April 22, when I went with the title: ""Why I Believe Abbott Is Much Better Positioned In Today's Rising Inflation Scenario.""  Since then, shares are down 3.2%, lagging the 11.6% return of the S&P 500 by a substantial margin. It has also allowed the S&P 500 to beat ABT over the past ten years. Including dividends, it has beaten the healthcare giant by exactly 34 points. Data by YCharts As we slowly approach the company's earnings release on July 18, I'll use this article to update my thesis and explain why I like the value ABT brings to the table. So, let's get to it! Forget COVID, Abbott Is Back I say this with the utmost respect for people who suffered from the pandemic, but it was one of the most bullish periods for healthcare companies like Abbott, who sold hundreds of millions of tests and related products. Google News (2020) The problem is that it pushed so much money into the industry that it took many years to unwind all of the ""bullishness."" For example, the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI), which returned 223% over the past ten years (excluding dividends), hasn't gone anywhere since January 2021! Data by YCharts This has created an extremely tough situation for investors, as it's hard to deal with an industry that goes from sky-high growth to contraction, followed by an uncertain path of growth. That really does a number on our ability to find appropriate P/E multiples. The good news is that 2024 seems to be the first year of elevated optimism. For example, in the first quarter, the company raised its full-year guidance, expecting adjusted EPS between $4.55 and $4.70. It expects organic sales growth, excluding COVID-19 testing, of 8.5% to 10.0%. Abbott Laboratories This was driven by strong underlying growth, including the achievement of ex-COVID double-digit organic sales growth for the fifth consecutive quarter, with a 14% growth rate in Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceuticals. What makes ABT so powerful is diversification and its ability to innovate in each of its key segments. This includes the news that it obtained product approvals and has seen major milestones in critical clinical trials in a number of key areas. For example, in Diagnostics, Abbott received FDA approval for a point-of-care diagnostic test that can determine if someone suffered a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in just 15 minutes, run on its i-STAT Alinity product. Abbott Laboratories As we can see below, the Diagnostics segment was the only segment with a negative impact from COVID-19. I highlighted organic growth and non-COVID organic growth in the table below. Abbott Laboratories Moreover, the company has seen 8% higher sales in its Nutrition segment, driven by double-digit growth in Pediatric Nutrition and market share gains in the U.S. infant formula business. On top of that, the launch of Protality, which is a new nutritional shake aimed at adults pursuing weight loss, is expected to further support growth in this segment. On a side note, this makes Abbott a winner of the current weight-loss pill trend, as its products go well with other weight-loss treatments. Meanwhile, in Diabetes Care, FreeStyle Libre sales reached $1.5 billion in the quarter. This translates to a 23% growth rate! Abbott Laboratories FreeStyle Libre also benefited from the expansion of reimbursement coverage in major European markets like France and Germany. The company is also rapidly growing in heart health, which is one of my favorite areas due to heart issues being the number one death cause. Using 2019 numbers (old but still relevant), a third of all deaths came from heart-related issues. Our World In Data In Structural Heart, the company saw a 13% growth rate. This was supported by products like Navitor, Amulet, and TriClip. Moreover, the recent FDA approval of TriClip, which is designed for treating tricuspid regurgitation, supports the company's ability to address major demand in another fast-growing market. Abbott Laboratories Last but not least, the company saw 17% growth in Neuromodulation, supported by the launch of Eterna and Liberta, which are devices for pain management and movement disorders (like Parkinson's) - also two important growth markets. Where's The Shareholder Value? One major benefit of owning ABT stock is its fantastic dividend. For starters, Abbott Laboratories is a Dividend King, which means it has hiked its dividends for more than 50 consecutive years. Please note that the dividend decline in 2013 was the AbbVie (ABBV) spin-off. Since then, both ABT and ABBV have raised their dividends every single year. Data by YCharts That said, a Dividend King title is great, but it's not enough. After all, when a company is mature enough to gain Dividend King status, sometimes it's so mature that dividend growth is slow. Hence, while I respect Dividend Kings, it's not a criterion I'm aiming for in my research. Luckily, ABT is different. It's a Dividend King that comes with a lot of dividend growth. Yielding 2.1%, the company has a 48% payout ratio and a five-year CAGR of 12.1%, which is a great deal for at least two reasons:  A 2.1% yield with double-digit dividend growth is a great combination. We can expect elevated dividend growth to last, as analysts are very upbeat about ABT's future.  After what we discussed in this article so far, it may not be a surprise that analysts are upbeat. Using the FactSet data in the chart below, analysts expect 4% EPS growth this year (including pandemic headwinds). 2025 and 2026 are both expected to see 11% growth. FAST Graphs As I have written in prior articles, I believe this recovery deserves a higher multiple than its long-term 19.8x average. Looking at prior growth recoveries, the company used to trade at 24-25x earnings. Using that number would pave the road for 12-14% annual returns in the years ahead. That said, I don't own Abbott. While I was looking to add it to my portfolio, I bought too many new positions this year to justify adding another one - at least for the next few months. Instead, I decided to focus on my investment in Danaher (DHR), which has a very high correlation to ABT. So, don't be surprised I'm not long ABT despite my bullish thesis. Takeaway I believe Abbott Laboratories presents a compelling opportunity due to its strong fundamentals and diversified growth across various segments. With significant advancements in diagnostics, nutrition, diabetes care, and heart health, Abbott's impressive dividend growth track record and innovative capabilities make it a solid long-term investment. In its 2Q24 earnings call, I expect the company to shed more light on innovation and its ability to move beyond the challenging post-pandemic environment. While I currently don't hold Abbott stock, its potential for double-digit returns in the coming years makes it a fantastic long-term play. Pros & Cons Pros:   Diversified Growth: Abbott excels in multiple segments, including diagnostics, nutrition, diabetes care, and heart health, which provides it with diversification and elevated growth.  Strong Dividend: As a Dividend King with a 2.1% yield and a five-year CAGR of 12.1%, Abbott offers reliable and growing income.  Innovation Leadership: The company's commitment to innovation, with products like Protality and FreeStyle Libre, positions it for long-term growth and market leadership.  Market Position: Despite recent underperformance, the company's fundamentals suggest it is in a great position for a rebound, especially in light of optimistic growth forecasts.   Cons:   Valuation Challenges: Short-term valuation may be affected by post-pandemic headwinds, potentially impacting short-term returns.  Uncertainty: Related to the point above, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on healthcare demand creates some uncertainty regarding future earnings and growth prospects. It's hard to put a valuation on a company at this stage of the cycle.  Competition: While ABT has proven to remain strong in light of competition, it operates in attractive markets with eager peers.

(CBC)Social SharingCost of Living5:15Zero dollar tip revengeWhen Alessandro Montelli was asked to tip when paying for a bottle of water at a local coffee shop, he knew something had to change with tipping culture.The Torontonian and recent university graduate had just finished a run and wanted to rehydrate. The barista behind the counter handed Montelli the water bottle and turned the point-of-sale (POS) machine ‚Äî with large¬†tip prompts for up to¬† 20 per cent ‚Äî to him.Montelli paid for the water without leaving a tip, and decided to share his experience on TikTok.""Normalize clicking 'no tip.' I am dead tired of [tipping] for things that should not be tippable,"" he said in the video.After years of ""tip-flation,"" which saw suggested tip amounts soar¬†up to 30 per cent in some cases¬†and gratuity prompts pop up at places where they weren't common before,¬†frustrated customers like Montelli are hoping to swing the trend back in the other direction by¬†leaving smaller tips ‚Äî or none at all.In a recent survey of adults who'd visited a sit-down restaurant in the last six months, 25 per cent of Canadian respondents said they were tipping less than they had been in the past. Almost 80 per cent of respondents said they're not a fan of auto-tipping prompts on digital payment machines, as well.WATCH | Tipping your wedding dress consultant?

The anonymous, Los Angeles-based user shares videos of himself leaving no tip, at every establishment, regardless of how good the service is.Montelli still tips at sit-down restaurants, or anywhere he says a genuine service is being provided.

Expect to see more 'tip creep'Bruce McAdams, an associate professor at the University of Guelph's school of business and economics who researches tipping, isn't surprised that customers are starting to rebel against tip-flation.""Maybe the only surprise is it's taken this long,"" McAdams told Cost of Living.Up, then back downDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, McAdams says average tip amounts left by customers increased by about five per cent in an effort to help service workers whose jobs were hit hard by lockdowns. As some¬†pandemic hardships eased in the past few years, however, tipping percentages programmed into POS devices have remained high.Tip options have also been added for products and services where they weren't expected in the past, such as oil changes ‚Äî a phenomenon known as ""tip creep,"" McAdams said.A masked barista prepares a cup of coffee behind a protective sheet. During the COVID pandemic, many consumers gave higher tips to service workers to compensate how lockdowns impacted their field of work. (Andrew Lee/CBC)McAdams says not tipping, especially at places where customers weren't asked to tip pre-pandemic, is a way for people to exert a bit of control.""It's almost like, 'OK, I'm going to get my revenge by not tipping my loonie, or my quarter on my coffee anymore. That's going to make me feel like the power's back with me and show that I'm tired of tipping,'"" said¬†McAdams of consumers.Anecdotally, McAdams says he's heard of at least a few businesses¬†lowering their tip presets on POS machines to better match customers' tipping habits, and after receiving some backlash from customers.""So, consumers have actually stepped up and made their voice heard in this instance,"" said¬†McAdams.Tip-flation has some restaurants asking for up to 30% in tipsTipping, in this economy? How tipping culture is evolvingFrom tip-flation to tip-deflation?The reaction to tipflation ‚Äî which could be described as tip-deflation¬†‚Äî¬†is probably driven by a mix of factors, in particular¬†the rising cost of goods and services making it more difficult to leave any tip at all, according to McAdams.As a customer, Montelli agrees. ""Budgets are getting tighter. So I think once [people] start evaluating, like, where can you save money? They're like, well this might be one of those spots,"" he told Cost of Living.McAdams says consumers are also beginning to see tips less as a bonus given for good service, and more as an expectation to help low-wage workers, which shifts the responsibility of paying them fairly onto the customer.WATCH | Some restaurants going 'tip free', opting to boost wages instead: Some restaurants going ‚Äòtip free‚Äô, opting to boost wages instead1 year agoDuration 2:08Some restaurants are doing away with tipping to combat ‚Äòtip fatigue‚Äô amongst cash-strapped customers, opting to adjust menu prices and boost servers‚Äô wages instead.""Everyone's resigned to the fact that [they're] just subsidizing minimum wage workers,"" said¬†McAdams. ""Tipping has always been a social norm. And I think that we're sort of pecking away and chipping away at that norm.""A 2023 Angus Reid poll found that 59 per cent of Canadians surveyed said they'd prefer a ""service-included"" model, which would see an end to tipping and employees wages increase instead to compensate them.Montelli says businesses shouldn't pass the onus of service worker's wages onto the customer through tipping, and hopes that by normalizing leaving no tip, consumers might force business owners to pay their staff better wages.""Tipping is like mist that is clouding the truth, which is people are not getting paid enough for the work they're doing,"" said¬†Montelli.""If we normalize no tip ‚Ä¶ that is when the pressure will come from the other side and then restaurants will be obligated to change the model.""Karen Kho, owner and operator of Empire Provisions and Lil' Empire Burger in Calgary, says on the whole, customers have been more conservative with their money as of late. That's been reflected both in the tip amounts left, and in their general purchasing habits.Karen Kho of Lil' Empire Burger in Calgary, right, is pictured along with her partner David Sturies. (Submitted by Karen Kho)But if consumers are really feeling stretched by the rising cost of everything, Kho said moving away from tipping might not be the best solution. She said if her staff weren't helped out by tips and she had to pay higher wages instead, she'd need to raise prices by about 15 to 20 per cent ‚Äî a standard tip amount ‚Äî anyway.""At the end of the day it comes from somewhere. If you wanted to eliminate tipping, then you have to be willing to pay the [higher] price,"" said¬†Kho. ""My argument would be at least the customer has control over [tipping].""At the end of the day, Kho says tipping is still supposed to be a reward for customer service, and the ""no tip"" option will continues to be there¬†for customers who don't want to leave something extra.""The choice is always in the customer's hand.

Reviews with updated data are posted when necessary. USMV strategy iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF (BATS:USMV) was launched on 10/18/2011 and tracks the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USD) Index. It has a portfolio of 170 stocks, a 30-day SEC yield of 1.72% and a total expense ratio of 0.15%. Distributions are paid quarterly. The fund√¢¬Ä¬ôs objective is a lower volatility relative to the broad U.S. equity market. USMV doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt focus on low-vol stocks like most low-volatility ETFs, but it uses sophisticated mathematical tools to optimize a portfolio with a low aggregate volatility. As described by MSCI, the underlying index is optimized from the MSCI USA Index to obtain a lower beta, volatility and capitalization bias, with a preference for stocks with low idiosyncratic risk. This process makes use of Barra Optimizer software library to √¢¬Ä¬úproduce an index that has the lowest absolute volatility for a given set of constraints,√¢¬Ä¬ù based on an estimated security co-variance matrix. Among the constraints, constituent weights are capped at 1.5% and sector weights must not deviate more than 5% from the parent index. The underlying index is reconstituted twice a year at the end of May and November. The portfolio turnover rate in the most recent fiscal year was 23%. This article will use as a benchmark the Russell 1000 index, represented by iShares Russell 1000 ETF (IWB). Portfolio The fund has about 68% of asset value in large and mega cap companies, and the rest in mid-caps. The heaviest sector is technology (26.3%), although it is less overweight than in the benchmark (31.6%). It is followed by healthcare (17%), financials (16.3%) and consumer staples (10.3%). Compared to the Russell 1000, USMV overweights financials and traditional defensive sectors: utilities, consumer staples and healthcare. It underweights mostly consumer discretionary, communication, materials and ignores real estate. USMV sector breakdown in % of assets (Chart: author; data: iShares)The top 10 holdings, listed below with some fundamental ratios, represent 15.7% of asset value and the heaviest position weighs 1.67%. Therefore, the portfolio is well-diversified and risks related to individual companies are low.

Nonetheless, this methodology also results in overweighting traditional defensive sectors relative to the benchmark. The current portfolio looks superior to the Russell 1000 index regarding value and quality, but inferior in growth. USMV has lagged the benchmark in total return since inception, but it is marginally better in risk-adjusted performance. It has also lagged several low-vol ETFs over the last 8 years, especially Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF, whose low-volatility approach includes earnings in addition to price.

6SXnqIo0RIFaJjh,Yahoo Finance,google,This Stock Beat Nvidia in the First Half. Can It Do It Again?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-beat-nvidia-first-half-081500992.html,2024-07-07 04:15,2024-07-07 04:21,NVDA,,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) added to its winnings in the first half, gaining about 150% after already climbing 1,300% over the past five years. The company dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, holding an 80% share, and also sells a variety of related products and services to companies launching AI projects. This has resulted in growth, with earnings advancing in the triple digits quarter after quarter.As great as this sounds, though, Nvidia isn't the best performer of the first half. Another stock actually soared past the chipmaker, skyrocketing 188%. This company also operates in the AI space and has seen earnings climb -- and this player actually benefits from growth of Nvidia and other chip designers.Could this Nvidia- and market-beating stock offer investors a repeat performance in the second half? Let's find out.Image source: Getty Images.Serving AI data centersThe player that's wowed the market in recent times actually has been around for quite a while -- more than 30 years to be exact. I'm talking about Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), a maker of servers, workstations, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment crucial to the operations of AI data centers. Supermicro's revenue progressively rose over the years, but the AI boom marked a clear turning point, helping sales and net income to skyrocket.Earlier this year, Supermicro even reported its first $3 billion quarter -- that was the company's annual revenue level as recently as 2021.Supermicro has benefited from demand for top AI chips because customers generally need not only a chip but a variety of equipment -- and the company integrates these chips into its products. So when Nvidia or Intel, for example, launch a new chip, this creates demand for Supermicro's products too. To maximize the benefit, Supermicro works hand-in-hand with these companies, monitoring their development pipelines so that it can immediately include their innovations in its equipment.And Supermicro's ""building blocks"" process -- with most of its products sharing common parts -- also makes it easy to quickly produce equipment tailored to customers' needs. All of this has helped the company grow five times faster than its industry over the past 12 months.There's reason to be optimistic this will continue because AI market growth is in its early days. Analysts predict today's $200 billion market will reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade -- and this should translate into sustained demand for Supermicro's products.Story continuesA new growth driverOn top of this, Supermicro's direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology may serve as a new growth driver for the company. AI data centers generate a tremendous amount of heat, and this situation only will worsen as workloads intensify.But Supermicro's DLC technology solves this problem, and customers now are taking notice. Supermicro's DLC solutions, increasing from zero market share to less than 1% in the company's 30-year history, could take as much as a 30% share over the next couple of years, The Taipei Times reported, citing the company's chief executive officer Charles Liang.All of this means Supermicro's spectacular growth may be far from over, and in the second half of this year, Nvidia's release of its game-changing new architecture -- Blackwell -- and chip could offer the equipment maker a new boost. Supermicro recently offered a sneak peek of its Blackwell products and says it's focused on developing new generative AI and inference-optimized systems accommodating the market leaders' latest chips.Could Supermicro beat Nvidia?Now, let's get back to our question: Could Supermicro continue to beat Nvidia and the general market in the second half? I think it's very likely this equipment giant will outperform the market, thanks to its growth prospects and position in the hot area of AI.As for surpassing Nvidia's gains, it's possible. In spite of Supermicro's first-half increase, the company trades at a significant discount to the chip designer -- about 24x forward earnings estimates versus 46x for Nvidia. At the same time, the earnings-per-share growth estimate of 62% for the coming five years for Supermicro tops average estimates of 46% for Nvidia.These points could attract investors and help Supermicro soar in the second half. But even if this top equipment company doesn't offer us a repeat performance in the coming months, that's OK. Supermicro still has what it takes to deliver earnings growth and share performance over the long term, and that's great news for investors today.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Super Micro Computer wasn‚Äôt one of them.

However, rest assured these types of lulls are common in even bull markets and often provide investors with valuable opportunities.While there are several options out there today, some are more alluring than others. Here is why Ethereum (ETH 0.27%) is the ultimate cryptocurrency to invest in today.Image source: Getty Images.Some simple math firstFrom a holistic view, it's easy to see why Ethereum takes the title of the ultimate cryptocurrency to invest in today. It is arguably one of the most widely used blockchains in the world and boasts an array of innovative use cases, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), borrowing and lending protocols, and stablecoins, just to name a few. Not to mention it is the unequivocal leader of one of crypto's highest potential economies -- decentralized finance (DeFi). Today, more than 60% of the DeFi economy calls Ethereum home, making it an ideal investment to gain exposure to the market's burgeoning potential.Yet, despite its well-known capabilities, compared to other cryptocurrencies Ethereum's price is further off of its previous all-time high. Take Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) for example. Today, Bitcoin sits about 15% off its all-time high of $73,000. As of this writing, Ethereum remains roughly 35% off of its peak price of more than $4,600.Not only is it a safe bet that Ethereum will eclipse its previous record, but it will likely set a new one as this bull market progresses. As to how high? Only time will tell, but rest assured Ethereum's leading position in DeFi and its vast array of use cases will ensure its price keeps climbing over the years.Ethereum should get a big break soonNow to focus on a more specific event. It is expected that in the coming weeks (maybe months if things don't go to plan) a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) will get approved. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to get a spot ETF approved, back in January this year.There are three reasons an ETF is so important. First, it democratizes access for investors. Buying and purchasing cryptocurrencies on exchanges can be difficult for the technically challenged. But with an ETF it's as easy as buying through of one's preferred brokerage with just a couple of clicks.Second, it opens the door for institutional investors. Institutions are already allocating to Bitcoin and now they have their eyes on Ethereum. Known for their deep pockets, the arrival of institutional investors holds the potential to transform Ethereum's value as wealth managers begin to better understand its foundational role in the digital economy.Last but not least, the spot ETF approval gives Ethereum an unofficial stamp of legitimacy. Right now only Bitcoin can make this claim, but this will soon change and put Ethereum in an exclusive class. While this alone might not cause its price to go higher, it does help provide staying power that is often hard to come by in crypto.The road to the spot ETF approval looks to be in sight, but there is still some time and potential obstacles to be cleared before Ethereum gets there. In the meantime, as the rest of the market jostles and struggles to build momentum, I'll be using this time to grab more Ethereum while it trades at a discount relative to its long-term potential. For those with a few extra bucks at their disposal and looking to increase their crypto exposure, few other options stand out as much as Ethereum.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)High spiritsAlthough she sympathizes with striking LCBO workers and their demands, London's Michelle Debus¬†sees an opportunity to expand her business's reach.""Initially I was like, 'Wow. I hope we get a lot more sales,'"" she said.She's the co-founder of Paradigm Spirits, a small-batch distiller that's located at 100 Kellogg Lane, and has been churning out whisky, gin, vodka, mixed drinks and more since 2018. Her distillery was awarded¬†the top prize of Whisky of the Year¬†in the 2024 Canadian Whisky awards.""To me, this is an opportunity to get our name out there and showcase our product. We've really dialled up our social media advertising and changed our online shipping prices to help,"" she said.Her pitch to Londoners interested in trying something new is¬†that Paradigm's spirits are always made from locally sourced ingredients, and there's a big focus on flavour in their products.Three different whiskies, poured into tasting glasses at Paradigm's distillery. The distillery currently offers one whisky in its shop.

""We are hoping in the end it'll bring more people to try our local products, though.""Storm Stayed offers fresh pints from¬†its taproom at¬†169 Wharncliffe Rd. S., with a wide range of local beers from pale ales¬†to IPAs¬†to lagers. It has two beers varieties on the shelves at LCBO stores and conducts sales in-house.""I honestly don't think a lot of brewers are seeing this as something that will affect them too much, because The Beer Store is still open,"" said Belanger, who admitted the brewing schedules for his beers that appear on LCBO shelves might have to change in the short term.Justin Belanger is the co-owner of Storm Stayed. He's pictured here in front of three of his many fermenters. (Alessio Donnini/CBC News)One local brewery that's sure to feel the effects of the strike is Anderson Craft Ales, at 1030 Elias St.According to owner Gavin Anderson, about 30 per cent of his beer sales happen in LCBO stores.""It's definitely going to cause a couple headaches we hoped we could avoid,"" said Anderson. ""We'll probably see an increase in our online orders for home delivery, which is more work for us. It's not bad¬†‚Äî we're happy to deliver ‚Äî¬†but it is more work.""Anderson hopes to see an increase in¬†online sales, advertisement¬†and visits to the brewery itself to offset the lost revenue, he said.¬†""I think if people come in they'll have a chance to try more things, and mix and match. It'd be good.""  Gavin Anderson founded Anderson Craft Ales in London, Ont., with his father Jim.  (Colin Butler/CBC News)Distillery supports having more options for getting alcoholAt another London distillery, opportunities are being eyed in the wake of the LCBO strike as well.Union Ten Distilling Co., which is known for its cream liqueur, vodka¬†and gin, has been operating in London for more than¬†10 years at 656 Dundas St., using locally-sourced ingredients for their products.""We've been focused a lot on shipping orders across Canada, but due to the strike, we're shifting and focusing locally,"" said Kelly Davis, a spokesperson for the distillery. ""We're offering free local delivery, and we've already seen an increase in orders.""According to Davis, when word of a looming strike started spreading, inquiries already started rolling in from customers.""We really support people having options, instead of just one organization, for getting their alcohol,"" she said.ABOUT THE AUTHORAlessio DonniniReporter/EditorAlessio is a multimedia journalist, and a London, Ont., native.

XxQn7ZI1GqnXnfo,The Motley Fool,google,Nvidia and Broadcom Announced 10-for-1 Stock Splits. This Nasdaq-100 Stock Is Most Likely to Split Next.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/07/nvidia-broadcom-stock-split-nasdaq-100-stock-next/,2024-07-07 05:12,2024-07-07 05:15,NVDA,,"Nvidia¬†shares have surged 760% since the beginning of 2023, and Broadcom¬†shares have surged 205% during the same period. Nvidia has already reset its share price by completing a 10-for-1 stock split on June 7, and Broadcom has a 10-for-1 stock split planned for July 12.Importantly, Nvidia was the fourth-most expensive stock in the Nasdaq-100 prior to its split, and Broadcom is currently the third-most expensive stock in the index. That's not surprising. The primary purpose of a forward stock split is to reduce the share price, thereby making the stock more accessible and more liquid.With that in mind, the Nasdaq-100 stock most likely to split next is the one with the highest price,¬†which is Booking Holdings. However, as my colleague Jon Quast eloquently describes, CEO Glen Fogel opposes the idea of a stock split. So, we can strike Booking Holdings from the list and move on to the next most expensive stock, MercadoLibre (MELI 4.24%).Investors should never buy a stock just because they expect it to split, but MercadoLibre is a worthwhile long-term investment whether it splits or not. Read on to see why.MercadoLibre is the market leader in e-commerce and retail advertising in Latin AmericaMercadoLibre operates the largest online commerce and payments ecosystem in Latin America, a region where e-commerce penetration is about half that of the United States.¬†Its marketplace receives nearly four times as many monthly visitors as the next competitor. MercadoLibre is expected to account for 29% of domestic online retail sales this year, up 70 basis points (0.7 percentage points) from the prior year.MercadoLibre has reinforced its success with adjacent financial services, logistics support, and advertising tools, which make its marketplace more convenient for merchants. The company has been successful on all counts. MercadoLibre is one of the largest fintech companies in Latin America, it operates the fastest and most extensive domestic delivery network,¬†and it accounts for more than 50% of retail media ad spending in the region.MercadoLibre reported strong financial results in the first quarter, handily beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 36% to $4.3 billion, reflecting sales growth in the commerce and fintech segments of 49% and 22%, respectively. Meanwhile, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income increased 71% to $6.78 per diluted share.During the first quarter, commerce sales benefited from increased adoption of fulfillment and advertising services, indicating that MercadoLibre is more effectively monetizing merchants on its marketplace. Additionally, fintech sales benefited from accelerating growth in total payment volume and increased engagement with credit products.The chart below shows MercadoLibre's revenue growth across both segments over the last five quarters.MercadoLibre's commerce revenue growth has accelerated in four consecutive quarters.Given its strong presence in several markets, investors have good reason to believe MercadoLibre can maintain that momentum. The company is steadily gaining share in e-commerce, which bodes well for its fintech and advertising businesses. In fact, MercadoLibre is forecasted to be the fastest-growing ad tech company in the world in 2024.More broadly, the digital economy in Latin America is expected to expand at 23% annually over the next three years.MercadoLibre stock trades at a reasonable price compared to Wall Street's earnings forecastWall Street expects MercadoLibre to grow earnings per share at 51% annually through 2026. In that context, the current valuation of 74.2 times earnings appears reasonable, especially when the two-year average is 109.7 times earnings.Investors should be cognizant of the risks. Most notably, Argentina (MercadoLibre's third-largest geography behind Brazil and Mexico) is suffering from hyperinflation, such that domestic sales declined 22% in the first quarter, as measured in U.S. dollars, despite surging 239%, as measured in Argentine pesos. That will likely be a headwind for the foreseeable future.MercadoLibre has historically been a very volatile stock. It carries a three-year beta of 1.59,¬†meaning it moved 159 basis points for every 100-basis-point movement in the S&P 500 during the last three years. Volatility cuts both ways. When MercadoLibre shares are rising, they can rise quickly. But when the stock is falling, it can fall sharply.Investors comfortable with that type of risk and volatility should consider buying a small position in this potential Nasdaq-100 stock-split stock today.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
8SeOqSdQCE2wTEm,The Motley Fool,google,Where Will Tesla Stock Be in 5 Years?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/07/where-will-tesla-stock-be-in-5-years/,2024-07-07 05:14,2024-07-07 05:18,TSLA,,"Share prices of Tesla (TSLA 2.08%) are up roughly 21% in five days since it was reported that second-quarter vehicle deliveries beat Wall Street's expectations. However, the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer's longer-term downward trend remains in effect as it grapples with high interest rates, competition, and other macroeconomic factors. Could the second-quarter deliveries indicate a sustainable recovery, or will Tesla continue fading out? Let's explore what the next five years could have in store for this innovative EV leader. Second-quarter deliveries beat expectations -- or did they?Tesla investors don't have to wait until earnings (expected to be released this month) to get updated on the company's performance. Management typically releases production and delivery data along with other vehicle manufacturers on a quarterly basis (it used to be released monthly). And the much-anticipated second-quarter numbers were no exception.With 443,956 cars delivered in the second quarter, Tesla beat Wall Street's consensus forecast of 439,000. But this is still down 4.8% from the prior-year period and represents the second consecutive quarter of declining deliveries after a 13% year-over-year drop in the first quarter. The better-than-expected delivery numbers sparked a double-digit percentage rally in the stock price, but the automaker is not out of the woods yet. The extent of the weakness could be revealed when the company releases its full quarterly report.Several key problems might come up. First is pricing. Automakers can drive volume growth by lowering prices. But this can come at the expense of revenue per car sold and margins. For Tesla, this could pose a big problem because its previously high margins are the main thing differentiating it from its uninspiring mass-market rivals.In the first quarter, its operating margins fell from 11.4% to 5.5%. And continued declines could turn the company into just another automaker.Musk to the rescue?With a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 6.33, its stock trades at a significant premium over the typical large U.S. automaker. For context, Ford Motor Company and General Motors trade for a P/S of just 0.3 and 0.36, respectively. And if Tesla becomes just another car company, it could lose much of its $560 billion valuation. Shareholders are betting that CEO Elon Musk won't let this happen. Fresh off securing an equity-based pay package worth $44.9 billion, Musk is incentivized to do everything possible to boost the stock price. He seems to be downplaying the automotive opportunity in favor of new growth drivers like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).Image source: Getty Images.The company is working on Dojo, a supercomputer designed to help train its machine-learning models for full self-driving (FSD). While Tesla isn't the only company tackling this effort, it has some advantages because of the vast amount of user data it can gather from its customers with FSD software installed in their cars. Musk says its robotaxi will be revealed on Aug. 8, along with its next-gen vehicle platform.If the robotaxis are consumer-ready, they could unlock a new nonautomotive revenue stream for Tesla, while putting it in a prime position to explore other AI uses like warehouse automation or possibly even humanoid robots over the next five years and beyond.Is the stock a buy? Tesla has once again become a highly speculative company. If current trends continue, its previously high-margin EV business could become commodified over the next five years amid rising competition and lower pricing power. This isn't enough to justify the stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 57 compared to the Nasdaq Composite's average P/E of 32.Investors who buy the stock now are betting on Elon Musk and his ability to transform the company into more than just an automaker through AI and robotics. This is a tall order. And the controversial executive has a track record of overpromising and underdelivering. With that said, Musk has rescued Tesla from the brink on several occasions, so there is good reason for the market to have some faith in him. The¬†stock looks like a hold pending more information.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
RiTqCK2VszVdlDr,Yahoo Finance,yahoo,Here's the Best-Performing Stock-Split Stock of 2024 So Far -- and It Isn't Even Close,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-best-performing-stock-split-095000521.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,2024-07-07 05:49,2024-07-07 05:57,NVDA,,"According to the Chinese calendar, 2024 is the ""year of the wood dragon."" For investors, though, this might be the ""year of the stock splits."" Several major companies have either already conducted stock splits or plan to do so over the next few weeks and months.Historically, stocks tend to perform well after announcing stock splits. That's been generally true this year, with one stock delivering especially big gains. Here's the best stock-split stock of 2024 so far -- and it isn't even close.The top contendersWalmart (NYSE: WMT) kicked off the ""year of stock splits"" in January with its announcement of a 3-for-1 split. CEO Doug McMillon said the giant retailer decided to split its shares for the first time since March 1999 to make its stock more affordable for its associates. Walmart conducted the stock split after the market close on Feb. 22, 2024.In March, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) announced that its board of directors approved a huge 50-for-1 stock split. A few months later, after winning shareholder approval a few months later, Chipotle conducted its stock split following the market close on June 25.Amphenol (NYSE: APH)¬†didn't announce its plans to conduct a 2-for-1 stock split until May. However, the electronic components maker beat Chipotle to the punch, conducting its stock split after the market close on June 11.Several other companies intend to split their shares soon. Williams-Sonoma's (NYSE: WSM) 2-for-1 stock split is scheduled for July 8. Chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split on July 12. Sony's (NYSE: SONY)¬†5-for-1 stock split should occur after the market close on Sept. 30.¬†Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX),¬†which makes equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors, plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split on Oct. 2.All three stocks that have already conducted stock splits have performed well so far this year. Walmart's shares are up nearly 30%. Chipotle and Amphenol stocks have both soared close to 36%.Nearly all the stocks with splits on the way have delivered strong gains as well. Broadcom is the best performer of the group, with its shares vaulting more than 50% higher year to date. Williams-Sonoma stock is up close to 40%. Lam Research isn't far behind, with a year-to-date gain of around 38%. The only lower among these stock-split stocks is Sony, whose shares have fallen close to 10% this year.The hands-down winnerHowever, another stock-split stock is the hands-down winner. In its first-quarter update on May 22, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced plans for a 10-for-1 stock split. The graphics processing unit (GPU) maker conducted this split after the market close on June 7.Story continuesNvidia's shares have skyrocketed more than 150% year to date, eclipsing all the other top stocks announcing splits this year. This huge gain comes on top of a 239% gain in 2023.Although Nvidia's share price rose by a double-digit percentage in the days following its stock split, it has retreated since then. The real engine behind Nvidia's spectacular performance this year is the continued strong demand for its GPUs, thanks to a massive generative artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind.Which is the best stock-split stock to buy now?The old saying that there are ""different strokes for different folks"" applies to which stock-split stock is the best to buy right now. Different investors will likely prefer different stocks based on their investing styles.If you're concerned about an economic downturn, Walmart is probably the best pick. The discount retailer is one of the top recession-resistant stocks around.Income investors don't have great options with these stock-split stocks. However, Williams-Sonoma offers a forward dividend yield of 1.6% -- the highest yield in the group. It's also neck-and-neck with Sony as the most attractively valued of these stocks.What about growth investors? I think Nvidia and Broadcom are good choices. Broadcom trades at a lower forward earnings multiple, but Nvidia's growth prospects remain exceptionally bright. It's arguably still the best stock-split stock for growth investors to buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Nvidia wasn‚Äôt one of them.

VfwjNxBbFrRUFUQ,Chicago Tribune,google,Mother fears stalking by ex's Facebook followers; police no help,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/07/07/facebook-posts-frighten-mother-pushing-police-to-act/,2024-07-07 06:06,2024-07-07 06:08,META,,"Shortly before Christmas 2022, Dominique Ward made an unplanned stop at Target to do some last-minute shopping with her 3-year-old daughters.She was miles from her home, in a neighborhood where she didn‚Äôt know a single person. She assumed no one there knew her or her girls, either ‚Äî until the following day when someone sent her a screenshot of a Facebook page belonging to the girls‚Äô father.He had posted ‚Äúan open letter‚Äù to his daughters, identical twins he had been barred from contacting without court supervision after multiple allegations of abusive behavior toward their mother.‚ÄúI got to see you the other day,‚Äù the note stated. ‚ÄúYou were in a target shopping cart wearing matching cute outfits. You we‚Äôre (sic) absolutely gorgeous, the most beautiful little babies I have ever seen. You were sitting next to each other playing with each other as your mom pushed you around. Your smiles were infectious and silliness was so familiar. What you don‚Äôt know (is) that there is a community of love surrounding you, sending Daddy pictures and videos keeping me updated on your progress.‚ÄùThe post stopped Ward cold.She had been locked in a custody and child support battle for years with her ex-partner, a computer whiz with a sizable social media following and a well-documented disregard for court orders. Since moving to Florida in 2021, he had been offering money on Facebook for information regarding his children, including:$25 per photo of the girls.$50 for videos.$100 for the address of a mother-child yoga class Ward was organizing.$10,000 for anyone who can bring the girls to him for ‚Äúa peaceful, arranged meeting.‚ÄùThe Target post was a reminder that people ‚Äî usually complete strangers ‚Äî were taking him up on the various offers and tracking her whereabouts.¬† And it was proof, yet again, that no one in authority cared enough to stop it.Records show that in the year leading up to the shopping trip, Ward and her attorney Lindsay Nathan had sought help from the Chicago police, Cook County prosecutors and Facebook employees. They all listened to her story and then explained why they couldn‚Äôt do anything about the posts, a reflection of the complex and, often, apathetic response to electronic harassment in  towns across Illinois.A Tribune analysis of crime data shows Chicago police made arrests in only 2% of the domestic-related electronic harassment and cyberstalking complaints received in the past 10 years.¬† And since 2021 ‚Äî the year Ward first went to authorities with her concerns ‚Äî the arrest rate has been about 1%.‚ÄúHow do I protect my children if I can‚Äôt even go to the store without someone following us or stalking my girls?‚Äù asked Ward, now 39. ‚ÄúWe have targets on our backs every time we leave the house, but no one is taking it seriously.‚ÄùIn a telephone interview with the Tribune, the children‚Äôs father, Micah Berkley, confirmed he wrote the posts soliciting pictures of his daughters on social media. He said he also seeks photographs through targeted Facebook ads that appear in the feeds of people who live within a ¬Ω-mile radius of Ward‚Äôs house and the children‚Äôs school.Micah Berkley, a tech entrepreneur, was featured last November in the Miami Herald in an article about using the power of AI to change the branding industry.¬† (Carl Juste/Miami Herald)Berkley, 41, considers his actions ‚Äî which continue to this day ‚Äî¬† to be ‚Äútechnological warfare,‚Äù a social media-driven, 21st-century way to fight back against custody and child support rulings that haven‚Äôt gone his way. He estimates he has paid about $6,000 for images and other information since he and Ward broke up in late 2020, though the Tribune could not independently verify that. No one has been able to claim the $10,000 reward for arranging a ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù meeting with the girls, he said.‚ÄúI hear she‚Äôs scared,‚Äù he told the Tribune. ‚ÄúShe should be scared. She should be terrified. I want her to worry about who‚Äôs waiting on the corner whenever she walks outside.‚ÄùAn analysis of data from nearly two dozen Illinois police departments found police rarely arrest people for electronic harassment, even as complaints increase. And though state laws have kept up with this very modern intimidation method, the laws‚Äô enforcers ‚Äî police, prosecutors, judges ‚Äî have not, experts say.‚ÄúWe have great laws on the books, but the problem is that they aren‚Äôt implemented,‚Äù said Vickie Smith, former CEO of the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ‚ÄúNobody thinks it is a big deal because they don‚Äôt understand how this kind of non-physical domestic violence can harm someone on a daily basis.‚ÄùPublic records show Ward has gone to the Chicago Police Department at least twice to file a report since 2021, explaining the situation just as her father ‚Äî a retired CPD officer ‚Äî instructed. Each time, she says, officers told her it would be difficult to prove her former boyfriend was behind the keyboard when the messages were posted and that prosecutors would be reluctant to charge the case. Berkley, who readily acknowledges he wrote and published the messages, says he has never been contacted by law enforcement in regards to his social media accounts.A Tribune analysis found the Chicago Police Department receives thousands of electronic harassment and cyberstalking complaints each year, more than a third of which are categorized as domestic-related. In 2023, for example, more than 2,400 people reported being electronically harassed or cyberstalked in Chicago ‚Äî with more than 800 of them saying the abuse was perpetrated by someone with whom they have a familial or intimate relationship.Dominique Ward sits on July 3, 2024, outside¬† the courtrooms on the 19th floor of the Daley Center, where she obtained an order of protection against her children‚Äôs father. (Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune)Of those 824 domestic-related complaints last year, only nine ‚Äî 1% ‚Äî resulted in an arrest.It‚Äôs an arrest rate more than 15 times lower than other domestic crimes in 2023, including battery and order of protection violations. Of more commonly reported crimes, only those involving deception ‚Äî such as pickpocketing, unauthorized credit card use and confidence games ‚Äî have lower arrest rates.A deeper look into the data offers a hint at how Chicago police handle these cases. In a review of those 824 cases from last year, while most were suspended unless more evidence developed, police outright closed more than a fourth of them, almost always using a category of disposition that describes when police are confident they know who did it but for some reason decide they can‚Äôt make an arrest.¬†https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PzvkS/1/Even the number of arrests can be deceiving. A look at arrests over the past decade found many came only after allegations of more serious crimes committed at the same time as the alleged harassment ‚Äî from arson to strangulation and home invasion.The lack of arrests isn‚Äôt exclusive to Chicago.  An examination of Illinois State Police and suburban department data shows police outside Chicago rarely make arrests.There are also very few people charged with cyberstalking on the federal level.¬† A 2023 Rand study found there were 412 cases charged by the U.S. Justice Department between 2010 and 2020. Though the number of cases has grown steadily since 2014 ‚Äî reaching a peak of 80 new cases in 2019 ‚Äî researchers found the legal system is largely unprepared to handle electronic harassment.‚ÄúThe big hurdles that we found, as far as law enforcement goes, relate to the capabilities to investigate electronic crimes,‚Äù said Sasha Romanosky, a senior policy researcher at Rand and co-author of the study. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of variation across the police departments in their skills and capabilities.‚ÄùElectronic harassment and cyberstalking can be difficult for law enforcement because they often involve tech-savvy offenders who are deft at hiding their tracks and it is sometimes hard to prove the suspect actually wrote the offending message, experts said. As a result, law enforcement seldom allocates substantial resources or prioritizes investigating these crimes.In its findings, the Rand study recommended increased training on emerging technologies and investigative strategies for law enforcement. It also suggested police officers and prosecutors be taught the complicated nature of working with victims, including recognizing that electronic harassment is a form of abuse.‚ÄúThere is a need for training for both police and prosecutors in regards to dealing with these kinds of intimate crimes to begin with so they can build that trust with the victim,‚Äù Romanosky said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also a similar story about training for police and prosecutors when it comes to understanding digital evidence.‚ÄùThe Chicago Police Department did not respond to questions about the handling of Ward‚Äôs complaints or electronic harassment cases in general.A February 2021 police report involving Berkley‚Äôs social media behavior states the case was closed because Ward did not want to press charges.Both Ward and her attorney dispute the CPD report, insisting she always wanted the electronic harassment to be investigated.¬† Their recollection is bolstered by a July 2021 email to the Cook County state‚Äôs attorney‚Äôs office in which Nathan expresses frustration with the lack of police response.‚ÄúMy client has made multiple police reports and at this point we just don‚Äôt know what to do,‚Äù she wrote to a supervisor in the Cook County state‚Äôs attorney‚Äôs Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence division.No charges were ever filed.The Cook County state‚Äôs attorney‚Äôs office did not respond to questions.Frustrated by the lack of help from local law enforcement, Nathan reached out to the FBI last year. Nathan shared Berkley‚Äôs Facebook posts, court records and Ward‚Äôs order of protection against Berkley with at least two federal agents, who expressed concern for Ward‚Äôs safety in emails reviewed by the Tribune. In the emails, the agents also said they were consulting with federal prosecutors, but nothing came of those conversations.She doesn‚Äôt know how far his social media followers might go.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like no one is going to care about this until I‚Äôm dead,‚Äù Ward said. ‚ÄúAnd by then it will be too late.‚ÄùThe FBI declined to answer the Tribune‚Äôs questions.Berkley contends he has a First Amendment right to his social media messages, including one post that published part of her cellphone number and another that revealed the name of Ward‚Äôs therapist and intimated ‚Äî without proof ‚Äî that the counseling center‚Äôs staff was providing him with information. He repeatedly said he does not want to physically harm Ward nor has he instructed any of his social media followers to do so.He also stated he did nothing improper when he created a video in May 2023, using artificial intelligence, that purports to be an NBC Nightly News broadcast and proclaims Ward to be ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs most despicable mother.‚Äù With an AI-generated voice nearly identical to anchorman Lester Holt‚Äôs delivery, the piece accuses Ward of using ‚Äúevery dirty trick in the book to ensure these girls are cruelly ripped away from their loving father‚Äôs embrace.‚Äù‚ÄúIt took me about an hour to make,‚Äù Berkley said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that hard for me. This is what happens when you make a nerd mad.‚ÄùBerkley and Ward agree about the basic facts of their shared history:¬† They began dating in 2015 and moved in together in July 2018. They broke up a few months later, around the same time Ward learned she was pregnant.Both wanted their children to be raised in a two-parent household similar to their own upbringings, so they reconciled. When the girls were born in May 2019, the couple was thrilled and, for a brief time, happy with their new life.Berkley soon began posting pictures of their twins on social media, drawing positive responses and significant traffic to his account. On his way to becoming an influencer, he started his own line of clothing aimed at Black parents, he said.‚ÄúThe girls are part of my brand,‚Äù Berkley said. ‚ÄúEveryone loved seeing a Black dad being so involved with his children.‚ÄùHe lost access to his so-called brand, however, after Ward broke up with him and went back to her parents‚Äô home. Police records state Berkley showed up at the house on April 5, 2020, armed with what turned out to be a pellet gun, and threatened to harm himself and Ward‚Äôs family.Berkley was charged with violating an order of protection and aggravated battery. Ward said she later asked for the charges to be dropped so Berkley could work and help support the children.A few months after the case was dismissed, Berkley began his social media campaign against Ward and started offering money for photographs of the girls. Berkley said most of his online support and photographs of the twins come from women.Nathan, Ward‚Äôs lawyer, used the Facebook posts to successfully extend an order of protection that, so far, has not been served on Berkley and as such makes it harder to enforce. The attorney has been told authorities can‚Äôt find Berkley, even though he frequently shows up for court hearings via Zoom and his photograph appeared on the front page of the Miami Herald late last year as part of a glowing feature on his AI business.A Cook County judge recently issued a body attachment for Berkley, allowing for his detainment in light of more than $50,000 in unpaid child support. Such orders are similar to bench warrants, though they are rarely executed in civil cases where the subjects live out of state.Berkley has been representing himself in family court, using AI programs he designed to write his own motions and memorandums. He often lashes out during the Zoom hearings, accusing Ward of kidnapping his children and ignoring the judge‚Äôs order to stop posting photographs of the children on social media.‚ÄúDominique‚Äôs case is an extreme example, but this is an issue that many, many women are struggling with every day,‚Äù said Nathan, director of family law for Ascend Justice, which helps victims of gender-based violence with legal matters at no cost. ‚ÄúI cannot accept that there is nothing that can be done about it.‚ÄùLaw enforcement, however, isn‚Äôt the only obstacle to preventing online harassment. Facebook also failed to address Ward‚Äôs concerns, despite numerous reportings and at least five letters or memorandums from Nathan since 2022.The social media network only took action after political consultant Joanna Klonsky learned about Ward‚Äôs struggles in late 2023 and asked Gov. J.B. Pritzker‚Äôs office to help.Public records show that Emily Miller, one of the governor‚Äôs senior advisers, reached out to a Meta lobbyist and requested Berkley‚Äôs account be deactivated. The page was removed almost immediately, raising questions about equal access and the social network‚Äôs efforts to protect users without political connections.Miller told Meta officials that the company had to do better and requested a meeting to discuss ways to make it easier for people to seek account suspensions, according to emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.‚ÄúIt is troubling to us that a woman who was being so clearly harassed, and whose abusive partner was offering money to strangers to stalk her children, tried for so long to have the content removed but was unsuccessful,‚Äù Miller wrote. ‚ÄúWhen the Governor‚Äôs office stepped in to escalate on her behalf, the content was quickly found to violate community standards and the content was removed. This woman and her attorney had written communication with five Meta employees, none of whom could or would help them.‚ÄùThe governor‚Äôs office declined to comment. A Meta spokesman said the company could not discuss specific cases.Berkley reacted to the suspension by posting his offers for photographs and videos on other Facebook accounts he managed. After he thanked followers for sending him a video of his daughters at a party this past April, Miller sent another scathing email to Meta officials.‚ÄúThe Governor‚Äôs office does not have time to keep people safe on Meta‚Äôs platform,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúMeta has to figure out how to prevent people from offering money for videos of children that show their location either directly with tagging or indirectly through context clues. Meta must make this stop. Meta has, quite literally, all of the data it needs to fix this.‚ÄùMeta responded by suspending all accounts connected to Berkley, which he says has hurt his business.After the pages were removed, a website called americasworstmother.com popped up, featuring a computer-generated image of Ward wearing an orange prison uniform, as well as her personal cellphone number and her business email address.¬†It is unclear who owns or manages the site, as most of that information has been redacted from its registration.Ward, for her part, says she is grateful to the Pritzker administration for intervening, but she worries about the women who don‚Äôt have a way to reach the governor‚Äôs staff. Advocates share those concerns, saying people with access ‚Äî even through a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of Ward‚Äôs attorney ‚Äî shouldn‚Äôt be the only ones to have protection.‚ÄúIt sounds odd to say given everything she has been through, but Dominique is one of the lucky ones,‚Äù said Smith, former CEO of the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ‚ÄúShe has an attorney who is providing legal assistance for free and who is fighting for her. She had a way to reach the governor‚Äôs office. Most women aren‚Äôt so lucky. They‚Äôre suffering alone.‚ÄùDespite the support, Ward doesn‚Äôt know how this situation will end ‚Äî and it frightens her. She‚Äôs not sure if she‚Äôll ever feel safe again or when she‚Äôll be able to stop looking over her shoulder in public.‚ÄúOne thing I won‚Äôt do? I won‚Äôt be silent about this,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI will keep talking. I will keep telling my story.‚ÄùShe shared her story recently at a breakfast to raise awareness for domestic violence. Before Ward spoke, the moderator asked the audience not to take pictures or post about her speech on social media. Outside the banquet room, a police officer sat watching the entrance because Berkley had made reference to the event on Facebook a few days earlier.He never showed, but he clearly had someone there taking notes. In an interview with the Tribune, he quoted parts of Ward‚Äôs presentation verbatim and wove details of her talk into the conversation.He lost his Facebook accounts on the same day of the speech, but he says the banishment will not stop him. He vows to keep his so-called technological war going, with plans to branch out to other platforms and rebuild his audience.‚ÄúThis ends,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwith me getting my kids back. There‚Äôs no other option.‚ÄùWard also feels like she has no other options. She will keep pushing police and prosecutors to treat electronic harassment more seriously.‚ÄúPeople tell me just figure out a way to live with it. No, no, no, I won‚Äôt do that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI refuse to live with it. I refuse to let my daughters live with it. This has to stop now.‚Äù",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

hA8uRMlrY3w2YA6,The Motley Fool,google,AMD's Key Advantage Over Intel Is Set to Vanish,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/07/amds-key-advantage-over-intel-is-set-to-vanish/,2024-07-07 06:30,2024-07-07 06:35,INTC,,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 4.88%) gave up on manufacturing its own chips back in 2009.¬†It was the right call -- AMD couldn't afford the mammoth outlays required to keep its fabs competitive with Intel (INTC 2.53%). While this move allowed AMD to focus on chip design while tapping manufacturing services from third-party foundries, Intel's manufacturing tech was the best in the industry until recently.Starting about five years ago, long delays and missteps by Intel related to its troubled 10-nanometer (nm) process node allowed AMD to flip the script. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which AMD uses for manufacturing, now offers more advanced process nodes than Intel has been able to muster. AMD's PC and server central processing units (CPUs) have had the advantage of superior manufacturing for the past few generations, helping the company win considerable market share.Intel is still the market leader, but AMD now claims about 20% of the PC CPU market and nearly 24% of the server CPU market. Progress in the server CPU market has been particularly impressive -- AMD's market share stood at just 0.8% at the end of 2017.Staging a manufacturing comebackIntel has had to make do with its inferior manufacturing technology, but the situation is set to change later this year. The company is doing two things that will effectively erase AMD's manufacturing edge.First, Intel has become more open to outsourcing to TSMC for manufacturing. The company will use TSMC's advanced 3nm process for the main compute tile in its Lunar Lake laptop CPUs, ensuring that the chips deliver the performance and efficiency gains Intel is targeting. This is the same process node that AMD is using for its upcoming Ryzen AI laptop chips, which will launch later this month.Second, Intel is full steam ahead on its plan to become the world's second-largest foundry by 2030. The company has launched products on its Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes, but neither can match TSMC's best. Intel 20A, which Intel will use for this year's Arrow Lake desktop CPUs,¬†and Intel 18A, which will be ready early next year, are expected to close the gap. Panther Lake, expected to launch sometime in 2025, will use the Intel 18A process.Even if Intel only matches TSMC in manufacturing, AMD's manufacturing edge will be a thing of the past.More competition is comingIntel and AMD have formed a duopoly in the PC CPU market for many years. That's now changing as Microsoft embraces Arm-based CPUs for Windows laptops. Capable devices powered by Qualcomm chips are on the market, and more CPU designers are likely to join the fray.For AMD, this competition is all downside. For Intel, there's downside but also upside. Intel is working with Arm to optimize its Intel 18A process for Arm-based chips,¬†so the company could end up manufacturing some of those competing PC CPUs down the road, especially if it can pull ahead of TSMC technologically.With AMD's manufacturing edge over Intel set to vanish and an increase in competition looming, the company may have a tough time maintaining its market share gains in 2025 and beyond.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

PvibXcY7LwuQsrw,Seeking Alpha,google,Chevron: Big Yield As Oil Prices Jump To Multi-Month Highs (NYSE:CVX),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702760-chevron-big-yield-as-oil-prices-jump-to-multi-month-highs,2024-07-07 06:54,2024-07-07 07:01,CVX,,"jewhyte Chevron (NYSE:CVX), like many Energy-sector stocks, has struggled on a relative basis to the S&P 500 so far in 2024. The group is higher, of course, but momentum has not been consistent with resource stocks over the past handful of months. Among the more recent trends that should be a concern to investors in oil and gas plays is that while WTI and Brent oil have been on the rise, closing last week at their best levels since April, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) remains below where it traded in early Q2. In fact, XLE is now at fresh relative lows dating back to early March when compared to WTI. I always get concerned when Energy shares lose ground while oil itself rises.  But we√¢¬Ä¬ôll know a whole lot more in the weeks ahead with monthly reports from both OPEC and the EIA this week and major integrated oil & gas Q2 earnings reports in early August. For now, I reiterate a buy rating on Chevron. I see the $284 billion market cap stalwart as cheap on valuation with high free cash flow, while its dividend yield should attract income-focused investors. Shares have returned 8% since my most recent buy rating, helped by higher oil prices since January. Energy Stocks Sag Despite Rising Oil   Stockcharts.com Back in April, Chevron reported a mixed set of quarterly results. Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $2.93 topped the Wall Street consensus forecast of $2.90, but the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs revenue fell shy of estimates, coming in at $48.7 billion, down 4% from year-ago levels, missing the consensus by $2.0 billion. Still, its worldwide production grew 12% compared to Q2 of 2023 and the firm returned $6 billion in cash to shareholders.  Chevron posted healthy refining and marketing earnings and solid exploration and production profits. Total production of 3,346 million barrels of oil equivalent per day was strong. Away from operational activities, the management team noted that its merger with Hess was pacing well, while its interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO) and the related Wellhead Pressure Management Project paces to start up early next year. So, there are favorable developments with respect to new assets that should be earnings accretive in the years ahead.  While Q2 net income fell to $5.5 billion in the most recent quarter, down from $6.6 billion year-over-year, the firm sports a more than 6% free cash flow yield which should easily support the current dividend policy and a significant stock buyback program. Shares traded fractionally positive following the Q1 report. Chevron's Q1 Cash Flow Summary   Chevron IR What I like is that even with capex ongoing and a major recent merger, the firm remains focused on shareholder returns. Key risks include weakness in global oil and gas prices, which could come about if we see a further slowdown in the US market. Also, there√¢¬Ä¬ôs the risk that key projects and the Hess integration could encounter challenges, resulting in higher costs and reduced earnings.  On earnings, analysts at Goldman Sachs see EPS falling 3% this year to $12.78 with a growth inflection in the out year and continued earnings strength through 2026. The current Seeking Alpha consensus figures show a less sanguine EPS trajectory, with non-GAAP per-share profits hitting $14.55 in 2025 and hovering close to that mark in 2026. Sales growth is seen as tepid, holding in the $195 to $200 billion range. Dividends, meanwhile, are forecast to increase over the next several years, potentially resulting in a dividend yield near 4.5% should the stock price hold current levels, while Chevron√¢¬Ä¬ôs free cash flow yield could reach double digits if Goldman√¢¬Ä¬ôs outlook comes to pass. Chevron: Earnings, Valuation, Dividend Yield, Free Cash Flow Forecasts   Goldman Sachs What√¢¬Ä¬ôs my take on the valuation? I see most fundamental conditions as on track. $14 of operating EPS remains doable over the year ahead. Applying a 12x multiple, the sector average per FactSet, and more conservative to my 13.5x P/E applied back in January, then shares should trade near $168, making the stock still materially undervalued today.  Chevron also trades close to its long-term price-to-sales ratio, so I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt see the stock as a tremendous deep-value play either. Chevron: Mixed Valuation Metrics, High Yield   Seeking Alpha Compared to its peers, CVX features a relatively soft valuation grade, while its growth path is a bit better than its Energy-sector peers. But with very robust profitability trends, the firm continues to produce high operating and free cash flow.  But the sellside has been less than impressed with the Integrated Oil and Gas industry firm √¢¬Ä¬ì there have been 12 EPS downgrades in the past 90 days, compared with just five upgrades. Finally, share-price momentum has been lacking, and I will detail key price levels on the chart to monitor later in the article. Competitor Analysis   Seeking Alpha Looking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show a confirmed Q2 2024 earnings date of Friday, August 2 BMO with a conference call later that morning. You can listen live here. The management is then slated to present at the EnerCom Denver 29th Annual Energy Investment Conference on August 18. Corporate Event Risk Calendar   Wall Street Horizon The Technical Take I highlighted neutral technical signs back in the first quarter. With Q3 now underway, the trend is not much changed. Notice in the chart below that shares remain confined within a consolidation pattern, with key resistance at a downtrend line off the late 2022 high just below the $190 mark. I see support in the $139 to $141 range. What is not so encouraging is that CVX√¢¬Ä¬ôs long-term 200-day moving average is flat to slightly negative in its slope, suggesting a neutral to modestly bearish primary trend. Also, take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the graph. It has begun to range in a bearish zone between 35 and 55 √¢¬Ä¬ì I would like to see momentum perk up and for the stock to climb above near-term resistance between $165 and $167. Based on the height of the consolidation pattern, about $50, a bullish upside measured move price objective to $215 would be in play if a breakout from the existing descending triangle pattern occurs. Overall, CVX has underperformed the S&P 500 as the stock keeps coiling. CVX: The Consolidation Continues, Softer RSI Trends, $140 Support   Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line  I have a buy rating on Chevron. The stock trades on the cheap side while free cash flow remains solid. With a more than 4% dividend, the stock should be one owned by yield-focused investors, while momentum players should monitor CVX for a breakout in the second half of 2024.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

I always assumed it only made sense to shop at Costco if you had a bigger household. A family with several kids, a group of roommates renting together, or maybe a small business owner who needed to supply their office. Would it really be worth the cost of a membership otherwise?¬†I have a bunch of grocery stores within a mile or two of my home, and the nearest Costco location is about a 30-minute drive away. In the nearly six years that I've lived here, I've never thought about joining the warehouse club.¬†Recently, though, I was chatting with my neighbors about how much they love their Costco membership for just the two of them, and it has me rethinking my decision. If I do decide to take the plunge, there are three main reasons why I'd do it.1. I have enough storage space for bulk goodsI live in a comfortably sized home for my needs, and since it's just my husband and me, there's more than enough storage space. I know we wouldn't have a problem storing bulk purchases like tissues or dish soap if we decided to make an occasional Costco run.¬†Our Picks for the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts of 2024Capital One 360 Performance SavingsAPY4.25%Rate infoCircle with letter I in it.See Capital One website for most up-to-date rates.

And since we cook at home a lot, it would be nice to have the option to buy these items at a discount.2. I don't have another similar membershipI wouldn't feel guilty about joining Costco because I don't have another club membership or paid shopping account that I feel like I'd be doubling up on. I don't belong to Sam's Club or Walmart+, and I haven't had an Amazon Prime membership in several years.¬†The annual cost of a Costco membership is $60 for the basic tier (Gold Star) and $120 for the Executive membership. If I was already paying for other accounts tied to specific stores, I would be less inclined to pay to get in the door at Costco. But since that's currently an empty line item in my budget, I know I'd be able to spring for it.3. I know Costco will refund my membership fee if I change my mindPerhaps the most reassuring reason why I'd consider joining Costco is that I know I can get my money back if I decide it's not for me.¬†Let's say I sign up today, but after several months, I realize I almost never make the trek to my closest warehouse store. And when I do, I'm not buying enough to justify the cost of my membership with the savings I'm getting. If that was the case, I could speak to member services and get my membership canceled, no questions asked.¬†Costco's website states, ""We will cancel and refund your membership fee at any time if you are dissatisfied."" That means that anytime during the yearlong membership you've paid for, you can cancel and get a full refund of your membership fee. That seems like a pretty excellent deal to me.Maybe I will...I'm still not 100% sure whether I want to sign up for a Costco membership, so I won't be racing out first thing tomorrow to join. But I realize there are plenty of great money-saving reasons to shop at Costco, and I don't want to miss out.¬†If you're thinking about joining as well, take a look at your current grocery spending and see whether you could save by buying some of your bulk items at Costco, if you have the space to store them. And if you use one of the best credit cards for Costco, you could come out even further ahead.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not a subscriber? You can sign up¬†right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.WashingtonCNN        ¬†‚Äî¬†                A vast swath of the US economy is showing sings of weakness as unemployment rises to it‚Äôs highest point in more than two years.                Consumer demand seems to have tapered off so far this summer, according to surveys of American businesses that sell any kind of service to make a profit, ranging from restaurants to dental clinics. That weakness is also evident in the latest spending figures ‚Äî a far cry from last year‚Äôs lucrative summertime spending spree when Americans shelled out for films and high-profile concerts.                The Institute for Supply Management‚Äôs latest monthly survey that gauges economic activity in the services sector showed that so-called new orders and overall economic activity unexpectedly slipped into contraction territory last month. The headline index fell to a reading of 48.8 in June from 53.8 in May as the new orders sub-index saw an even steeper decline, down to 47.3 from 54.1. (A reading above 50 indicates expansion while anything below that threshold points to a contraction.)                This apparent slowdown in demand, if it persists for long enough, could translate into service-providing businesses hiring at a slower pace and possibly slashing jobs. The overwhelming majority of employment in the United States is considered service-providing, specifically 86% of the 158.6 million total US jobs as of June.                ‚ÄúWhen you think of services, a lot of it is driven by the consumer, and consumers are key to where the US economy goes,‚Äù James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, told CNN. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre starting to see stress in more and more households.‚Äù                The US consumer is indeed under pressure, grappling with still-high inflation, the highest interest rates in more than two decades, depleted pandemic savings (according to some measures), and a growing load of debt. Consumer spending, which makes up about 70% of the US economy, has already moderated over the past few months, government statistics show, and retailers themselves have said they‚Äôve noticed shoppers across the income spectrum change their purchasing behavior.                A food services business surveyed by ISM said ‚Äúsales and traffic remain soft compared to last year,‚Äù blaming ‚Äúhigh gas prices in California and constant news about inflation and restaurant menu prices.‚Äù Spending at restaurants and bars declined 0.4% in May,¬†according to the latest Commerce Department figures on retail sales. A retail company told ISM: ‚ÄúWith inflation continuing, will customers have enough discretionary funds to spend?‚Äù                Knightley provided CNN an analysis of government data showing that Americans in the top 20% of earners were responsible for a large share of spending on services related to transportation (air travel and cruises), recreation, food and finance. The bottom 60% of households by income accounted for a larger proportion of spending on health care services.                But it takes time before slowing demand translates into slower hiring or layoffs because businesses have to determine if they didn‚Äôt just deal with a bad month or two, perhaps even a bad quarter,¬†Scott Hamilton, global chairman of human resource and compensation consulting at Gallagher, told CNN.                Service-providing businesses have already been hiring at a weaker clip. These firms have added 168,000 jobs a month, on average, from April through June, according to¬†fresh Labor Department data¬†released Friday. That‚Äôs much lower than the average for the prior three months, from January through March, which was 241,000 jobs. Last year, the average monthly job gain in the services industry was 228,000 jobs. Hiring trends, of course, vary within the services sector, a huge slice of the job market.                Last month, retail trade employment shrunk for the first time since November while temporary help services contracted by 48,900 jobs, dragging down the broader professional and business services super sector, which lost 17,000 workers. Health care has been one major bright spot for the services sector, adding jobs at a brisk pace for the past few decades, excluding a drop off in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but even then, some businesses in that industry have recently noticed softening demand.                ‚ÄúDemand for services has moderated after near-record patient levels in the last month,‚Äù a health care and social assistance firm said in the latest ISM survey.                The job market staged a stunning comeback when the broader US economy recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, eventually leading to unemployment falling to a half-century low of 3.4% in 2023 for the first time. It‚Äôs loosened up recently, however, with unemployment now at 4.1%, the highest level since November 2021, and new applications for jobless benefits on an upward trend. Fed officials are keeping a close eye for any alarming signs of weakness in the job market as they await for further evidence that inflation will continue to slow without an unexpectedly hot economy sabotaging that.        Tesla is now an official Chinese government car            For the first time ever, Tesla cars have been placed on a Chinese government purchase list, according to state-owned media outlet¬†Paper.cn.                Tesla is the only foreign-owned EV car brand on the purchase catalog published by the government of Jiangsu province in eastern China. The other brands mentioned include Volvo, owned by China‚Äôs Geely, and state-owned SAIC, reports my colleague Laura He.That means that government agencies and public groups in the province can procure them as service cars, highlighting the¬†cozy relationship¬†China has with Elon Musk‚Äôs company.                The development has gone viral on Chinese social media, with some users questioning if foreign cars should be considered for use by the government.                The Jiangsu government has tried to ease such concerns by saying that the Tesla model is ‚Äúa domestic car, not imported,‚Äù according to¬†a report¬†by state-owned National Business Daily on Thursday, citing a government employee.

ikRnvOYghpCl1KG,Seeking Alpha,google,Applied Optoelectronics: The Bottom Is Not Likely In (NASDAQ:AAOI),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702765-applied-optoelectronics-the-bottom-is-not-likely-in,2024-07-07 07:34,2024-07-07 07:40,MSFT,,"IR_Stone My, how time flies! It seems like only yesterday that I wrote an article about a fairly small company by the name of Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI). This firm provides niche technology solutions to different end markets like Internet data centers, cable TV, telecommunications firms, and fiber-to-the-home businesses. Back at that time, I found the company to be an interesting one. In particular, the company seemed to make for an intriguing prospect for investors banking on global data center growth. But because of its mixed financial performance, I made the claim that the company would likely see a very binary outcome that would be based largely on how things would ultimately go in its operations in Asia. Since then, the firm has not fallen short of those expectations. Unfortunately, the stock did not move the way that many investors would have wanted. It took the other route, plunging 83.4% compared to the 97.9% increase that the S&P 500 saw over the same window of time. To put this in perspective, $1,000 invested in the stock at that moment would be worth only $166 today. By comparison, that same amount invested in the broader market would be worth $1,979, or nearly 12 times what the investment in Applied Optoelectronics would have turned into. Given how much the stock has plummeted, you might think that I would consider the company a good opportunity to buy into. It is true that the firm has some positive aspects to it that investors should be aware of. But when you consider its overall financial performance, particularly its most recent results, I would actually argue that rating the company a 'sell' makes for a good deal of sense. Continued downside is possible As I mentioned already, Applied Optoelectronics caters to four different end markets. To these markets, it provides a variety of optical communications products that are vital for those markets to exist. For instance, it provides customers with optical transceivers that plug into switches and servers in data centers. Those allow the devices within those centers to transmit data over fiber optic cables. The firm produces its own lasers and other components that go into these optical transceivers. To the cable TV market, it produces and sells things like amplifiers that help to amplify TV signals before they reach a receiver or other device. To the telecommunications industry, the company sells lasers and lasers subassemblies, not to mention transceivers, mostly to network equipment manufacturers and other producers of optical transceivers. These devices are mostly used in 5G mobile networks. Applied Optoelectronics At first glance, exposure to these markets might seem to offer significant upside potential. But considering that 71% of the firm's revenue in the latest quarter came from sales to the data center space and another 21% of revenue involved cable TV, the telecommunications market and the fiber-to-the-home market are both more or less insignificant. When we focus on the data center market, there does seem to be optimism about what the future holds. As you can tell from the image above, management expects significant growth in the global data center space over the next few years. For the optical modules space, the expectation is for growth from around $6.5 billion this year to somewhere just north of $10 billion by 2027. This is focused only on the high speed, defined as 100G and above, optical module space. At this point in time, there is a big shift occurring in the data center market from 100G and 200G units to 400G ones, with annualized growth involving those expected to be around 27% from 2021 through 2027. Eventually, it's expected that there will be a further move higher for the 800G ones. But that won't begin until sometime next year. Applied Optoelectronics Over the past couple of years now, management has reported a nice increase in sales to data centers. Back in 2021, the firm generated $97.5 million in revenue from that space. Revenue did end up dropping to $77.1 million in 2022 before jumping to $141.2 million last year. As impressive as this growth is, however, the firm has had a rocky operating history when it comes to sales to data centers. Back in 2018, for instance, the company generated $200.2 million in revenue from those activities. Even though management was forecasting transceiver growth from around $3 billion a year in revenue that year for the industry to $6.7 billion by 2022, revenue is still lower today than it was six years ago. Management also seems to have a pretty bad track record of understanding industry conditions. After seeing revenue to data centers drop from $173.4 million in 2020 to $97.5 million in 2021, it forecasted a return to growth in 2022. But as I detailed already, the firm saw a further contraction that year. Author - SEC EDGAR Data Even though I think investors are in the right to question whether or not Applied Optoelectronics will actually see an increase in demand for its products, there happened some positive developments that investors should be aware of. In particular, in the middle of last year, Applied Optoelectronics announced that it struck a five-year deal with Microsoft (MSFT) whereby Applied Optoelectronics will provide Microsoft with design services and assembly services of certain 'goods'. Last year, 46.6% of the company's revenue came from Microsoft. So clearly, this should only be considered a welcomed development. Author - SEC EDGAR Data There seems to be a lot of volatility for the company in general. Even when it comes to the cable TV category, after seeing revenue climb from $37.3 million in 2019 to $118.2 million in 2022, there was a plunge to $59.9 million last year. Management attributed this to the decision of its customers to pass up on purchases of older generation DOCSIS 3.1 equipment because of the release, for this year, of newer DOCSIS 4.0 products. For those not familiar with this, DOCSIS 3.1 is a type of technology that helps to boost cable high speed data to speeds sometimes as high as 10Gbps for the purpose of downloads and for upload speeds on certain networks to 1Gbps. By comparison, DOCSIS 4.0 permits allows downstream capacity that is essentially the same as the 10Gbps that DOCSIS 3.1 has, however, with upstream capacity of 6Gbps, DOCSIS 4.0 is between three and six times faster van the older alternative. So far, with revenue in the first quarter of 2024 amounting to only $8.7 million, which is well below the $27.8 million reported for the same end market in the first quarter of 2023, we have not seen this surge in orders just yet. But the expectation is that, at some point, this transition from one technology to the other will drive revenue growth for the business. Author - SEC EDGAR Data Despite the potential that Applied Optoelectronics seems to have based on the industries that it caters to, particularly the data center space, the overall financial health of the business is anything but impressive. In the chart above, you can see financial performance for 2022 and 2023. And in the chart below, you can see data for the first quarter of last year and the first quarter of 2024. Revenue has been mostly falling, and the company's bottom line, while healthier last year than the year prior, has shown signs of further weakening this year. Author - SEC EDGAR Data At the end of the day, it's really not possible to value a technology-oriented firm that fails to generate positive earnings and/or profits. But what we can do, as I showed in the chart below, is to look at what kind of cash flow the business would need to generate in order to trade about either 10 times or 15 times on a price to operating cash flow basis, or on an EV to EBITDA basis. These numbers seem quite a bit out of reach when you consider how the company has fared in recent years. Now, if revenue growth was occurring at a rapid pace, then the picture might be different. But that is not the kind of situation we have on our hands. What we have instead is a business that sees extreme volatility in its leading markets each year, and that is generating net losses and cash outflows. Author - SEC EDGAR Data Takeaway  As interesting as I find Applied Optoelectronics to be, the company does appear to be problematic. Management talks a big game by pointing out industry potential. However, the company's fundamental past has shown a different story. As tempting as it is to give way to hope regarding what the future holds, it's difficult to be optimistic when the business in question shows continued weakness and bottom line pain. Given these factors, I think that further downside is probably warranted from here. Because of that, I have decided to rate the firm a 'sell' at this time.

AwDmBH6b3ByQhWo,Investorplace,google,3 Overvalued Tech Stocks Heading for a Fall,https://investorplace.com/2024/07/3-overvalued-tech-stocks-heading-for-a-fall/,2024-07-07 08:02,2024-07-07 08:08,NVDA,,"When it comes to stocks, valuation matters. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company‚Äôs share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). The P/E ratio helps to determine if a stock is expensive, or trading at a high multiple, relative to its peers or the overall market. Currently, the average P/E ratio among stocks listed on the benchmark S&P 500 index is near 25 times future earnings estimates.During the 2022 bear market, the average P/E ratio among U.S. stocks was closer to 17 times earnings. Stocks trading at extremely high multiples are often doing so because investors are banking on big future growth at the company, or because hype surrounding a stock is leading to a lot of people buying it. Value investors rigorously scrutinize valuations before buying a stock. Warren Buffett famously won‚Äôt buy a stock that has a P/E ratio above 15.So, let‚Äôs explore three overvalued tech stocks heading for a fall. Don‚Äôt slip up on them.CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comThe stock of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks pricey trading at 727 times future earnings estimates. In the last 12 months, CRWD stock has risen 167%, including a 57% year-to-date (YTD) gain. The sharp move higher has given CrowdStrike stock a lofty valuation. The high P/E multiple was one of the reasons the stock was recently downgraded by analysts at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR).Piper Sandler lowered its rating on CRWD stock to a hold equivalent neutral from an overweight buy equivalent rating previously. The analysts maintained their price target on the stock of $400. Also, Piper Sandler noted that CrowdStrike stock has few catalysts working in its favor currently. And, the risk/reward for the shares has become less favorable after the big move higher over the past year.Datadog (DDOG)Source: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.comDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) looks woefully overpriced right now trading at 443 times future earnings approximations. The company, whose software is used in cloud-computing, has seen its share price rise only about 34% in the last 12 months. However, the move has still pushed shares of the company, which went public in 2019, up to extreme heights relative to its earnings outlook.Investors are clearly betting on big future growth at Datadog, which builds cloud monitoring and security products that work with Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other cloud platforms. Analysts are less convinced and have also been downgrading this stock. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) lowered its rating on DDOG stock to neutral from buy, dropping its price target to $105 from $123.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAmong semiconductor stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) looks pricey trading at 239 times future earnings estimates. AMD stock, which has risen 43% in the last 12 months, is more expensive than rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The latter‚Äôs share price is up 203% over the last year but currently trades at a P/E ratio of 75. Some analysts speculate that the valuation is holding back AMD stock.Since hitting a 52-week high in March of this year, AMD stock has declined nearly 30%. Lackluster financial results are part of the reason. But so too is the premium at which the stock has been trading based largely on hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). In June, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) downgraded AMD stock to a hold equivalent equal weight rating from a buy equivalent overweight rating. The investment bank held its price target on AMD stock at $176.In their downgrade, the analysts cited Nvidia as a superior option in the semiconductor space that‚Äôs available at a cheaper multiple than AMD.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole¬†held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system maintains a Hold rating on the stock, while Wall Street analysts are more upbeat with a consensus Buy recommendation.  Roberts Berzins, a Seeking Alpha author, expressed caution regarding Saratoga Investment (SAR) by stating, ""After the release of Q4 2024 earnings, there is still an insufficient base of positive data points that would justify going long SAR. Currently, SAR is in a dangerous situation, where it holds the highest leverage profile in the BDC sector and, meanwhile, is experiencing difficulties keeping the existing adjusted net investment income results stable."" Berzins added: ""All of this has taken place despite SAR's record portfolio quality levels, where there have not yet been any bumps from the non-accrual side. It is clear that sooner or later, SAR will be forced to recognize write-downs, and in that case, the effects would be very material given the presence of such enormous leverage.""

Thursday, July 11 PepsiCo (PEP) PepsiCo (PEP) is set to release its Q2 earnings before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts anticipate Y/Y growth in both revenue and earnings following the company's strong Q1 performance, particularly in its international business. For FY2024, PepsiCo projects at least 4% organic revenue growth and at least 8% core constant currency EPS growth. A week before the earnings report, Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system downgraded PepsiCo from Strong Buy to Buy, aligning with Wall Street analysts' recommendations. Opinions among Seeking Alpha authors are divided on PEP. Bearish author Empyrean Research highlights that PepsiCo's Q1 2024 net sales slightly exceeded consensus estimates but noted volume declines in FLNA (Frito-Lay North America) and PBNA (Pepsi Beverages North America). The analyst also points out strong growth potential in international markets, particularly India, but warns of potential pressure on operating margins.  On the bullish side, SA author Dividend Power acknowledges near-term challenges related to volume growth, inflation, and stressed customers but emphasizes PepsiCo's long-term competitive advantages in distribution, iconic brands, and scale. The analyst argues that the stock is undervalued, with a dividend yield of approximately 3.25% and a fair value estimate of $187.91, making it a long-term buy for dividend growth portfolios.  Consensus EPS Estimates: $2.16 Consensus Revenue Estimates: $22.65B Earnings Insight: Pepsi has beaten EPS estimates in 8 consecutive quarters, beating revenue estimates in 7 of those reports.

U.S. companies paid a net $16 billion more in dividends during the second quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That was slightly more than the net increase in the first quarter and about four times higher than in the prior-year period. Many companies contributed to the increase by initiating a dividend or raising their payout. However, two companies stood out as the biggest drivers of the boost in dividend payments last quarter: Alphabet (GOOG 2.44%) (GOOGL 2.57%) and Meta Platforms (META 5.87%). Here's a closer look at these two magnificent dividend stocks. A monster dividendTech titan and ""Magnificent Seven"" member Alphabet initiated a regular quarterly dividend in late April. It made its first payment of $0.20 per share in mid-June. Alphabet's initial dividend seems small relative to its stock price (it currently has a 0.4% dividend yield, well below the S&P 500's 1.3% yield). However, it's massive on an absolute basis. It will cost the company about $10 billion per year. That made it the most meaningful contributor to the second quarter's increase in dividend payments. The technology giant can easily afford that monster payment. The company generated $16.8 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter alone. It also had $108 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet against a mere $13.2 billion of long-term debt. That strong financial position enabled the company to add a whopping $70 billion to its share repurchase program. Alphabet's initial dividend is likely only the starting point. Given the company's financial strength and earnings growth (more than 50% in the first quarter), it should be able to steadily increase its dividend payment in the future. Another magnificent dividendAlphabet's dividend initiation followed in the footsteps of fellow Magnificent Seven member Meta Platforms, which initiated a dividend during the first quarter. The social media giant is paying $0.50 per share each quarter. Like Alphabet, Meta Platforms' dividend might seem small at first glance, given its low 0.4% dividend yield. However, its total payments will tally a massive $4.4 billion per year. That's the second-highest absolute dividend increase this year, more than double the newly minted dividends of Salesforce ($1.5 billion) and Booking Holdings ($1.2 billion). Add that trio to Alphabet's recently initiated payment, and 53% of this year's net increase in dividends has come from those four new dividend stocks. Meta Platforms can also easily afford to pay its mammoth dividend. The company generated $12.5 billion in free cash flow during the first quarter and had $58.1 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet. The company's robust financial position is giving it the flexibility to invest heavily in AI while also returning generous amounts of cash to shareholders through its recently initiated dividend and share repurchase program (Meta bought back $14.6 billion in shares during the first quarter while paying about $1.3 billion in dividends). The company is in an excellent position to increase its dividend in the future. In addition to its strong financial profile, Meta's earnings are growing briskly (over 110% increase in the first quarter). The company's heavy investment in AI could drive robust future growth. Companies are doling out more dividendsCompanies in the S&P 500 are on track to pay 6% more in dividends this year. That's an acceleration from last year's increase (5.2%), thanks in part to the recently initiated dividends from Magnificent Seven members Meta Platforms and Alphabet.That upward trend in dividend payments appears likely to continue. Many companies, especially large technology companies, are flush with cash and briskly growing their free cash flow. That puts them in an excellent position to continue lining their investors' pockets with higher dividend payments. So, if you're looking to make some extra money, investing in dividend stocks could be your ticket to a steadily rising passive income stream.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

38CCnr5dp07An7E,The Motley Fool,google,Better Megacap Stock: Nvidia vs. Microsoft,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/07/better-megacap-stock-nvidia-vs-microsoft/,2024-07-07 08:44,2024-07-07 08:48,NVDA,,"Let's face it: 2024 has been all about the megacaps. Nvidia (NVDA -1.91%) is up 147% year to date; Meta Platforms is up 44%; Alphabet is up 33%.Moreover, Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms now boast a combined market cap of $15.6 trillion. That's roughly equivalent to the size of the Eurozone economy, which has an annual gross domestic product of $15.4 billion, according to the latest estimates from the World Bank.So, let's compare two of the best megacaps, Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT 1.47%), to see which is better positioned to rule the second half of 2024 -- and beyond.Image source: Getty Images.NvidiaNo company has experienced a more remarkable growth in its market cap over the past two years than Nvidia. The semiconductor giant has added a staggering $2.7 trillion in value, catapulting it to the position of the most valuable company on Earth, if only briefly.Its rise is almost entirely thanks to the surge in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and the hardware behind it. Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs). These powerful devices are often linked together by the thousands -- even hundreds of thousands -- within data centers to help train the latest and greatest AI models.While there are other companies in the GPU design space, Nvidia enjoys several key competitive advantages. The trust and familiarity AI developers have with Nvidia's GPUs and its software make it challenging for them to switch to another supplier. Moreover, Nvidia's extensive experience in GPU design prior to the AI boom gives it a unique edge over its competitors.MicrosoftDespite the attention garnered by Nvidia's rapid ascent, it's important not to overlook Microsoft's impressive stock performance. The company once again holds the title of the most valuable company on Earth, a position it regained after briefly being overtaken by Nvidia. To maintain this lead, Microsoft is demonstrating its adaptability to the evolving tech landscape, particularly the AI revolution.On that front, Microsoft has already begun integrating AI into its signature software applications. It now offers a generative AI assistant through its Microsoft Copilot add-on, which can analyze data, respond to queries, create images, and generate code.What's more, Microsoft diverse business segments provide a layer of protection, should the AI revolution falter. The company has a massive cloud services unit and a successful gaming division among various other business segments.Which stock is a better buy in the second half of 2024?Simply put, both Nvidia and Microsoft are outstanding companies. They generate billions in revenue, profits, and free cash flow. They're also led by some of the top CEOs on the planet: Satya Nadella at Microsoft and Jensen Huang at Nvidia.However, there are differences to evaluate. For one, Nvidia's valuation is approaching record highs. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is now 39x -- more than double its 10-year average of 15x.Meanwhile, Microsoft's P/S ratio is also historically high at 14x. However, that value is less than half of Nvidia's on an absolute basis.MSFT PS Ratio data by YChartsIn other words, both stocks are historically expensive, but Nvidia is far more costly in a head-to-head comparison. At any rate, the rapid growth of the GPU market is what investors are counting on to bring Nvidia's valuation down. And while those growth estimates are impressive (analysts expect Nvidia's sales to rise 98% over last year), any signs of slowing growth could lead to a sharp sell-off in Nvidia shares.In conclusion, I prefer Microsoft, given the stock's more reasonable valuation at current levels. That said, long-term Nvidia investors shouldn't bail on the stock now. Rather, they should remember that one of the keys to successful buy-and-hold investing is to let winners run.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
X8xAGIBAk8mrRLm,The Motley Fool,google,Rivian Just Made a Game-Changing Move. Here's What You Need to Know,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/07/rivian-just-made-a-game-changing-move-heres-what/,2024-07-07 09:00,2024-07-07 09:05,RIVN,,"Rivian Automotive (RIVN 0.96%) has been a tough stock to own since its initial public offering (IPO). The electric vehicle (EV) maker went public at $78 per share on Nov. 10, 2021, and set a record high of $172.01 less than a week later, but currently trades at about $15.Rivian initially impressed investors because it was already producing thousands of vehicles and was backed by Amazon¬†and Ford Motor Company. Unfortunately, its stock crumbled as it missed it own production targets, racked up steep losses, and lost Ford as a leading investor. Rising interest rates also popped its bubbly valuation.Image source: Rivian.But on June 25, Rivian announced a new joint venture (JV) with Volkswagen (VWAP.Y 0.52%) to co-develop new EV technologies. Many bullish investors praised the partnership as a game-changing move for Rivian, and its stock has soared more than 30% since its opening price that day. Let's see what this deal might mean for Rivian's future.How Rivian and Volkswagen can help each otherRivian and Volkswagen's joint venture will be equally owned and controlled by both companies. It will use Rivian's zonal hardware design and integrated technology platform as a foundation to develop new software-defined vehicles (SDVs) for both companies. Rivian will license its intellectual property to the JV.For now, Volkswagen will start using Rivian's existing electric architecture and software platform to build new EVs. But by the ""second half of the decade,"" both companies plan to launch new vehicles created from the JV's co-developed technologies. A recent rumor also suggested Rivian was in early talks with Volkswagen to expand their software partnership into a manufacturing one, but Rivian refuted those claims.Volkswagen plans to invest up to $5 billion in Rivian and the JV. It already bought $1 billion of Rivian's notes, which will be converted to its common shares on Dec. 1, and it plans to make two additional tranches of $1 billion investments in 2025 and 2026. It will also invest $1 billion in the JV upon its inception and provide it with a $1 billion loan in 2026.That big investment isn't too surprising given Volkswagen remains an underdog in the EV market. Its sales of battery-powered EVs rose nearly 35% to more than 771,000 units in 2023, but that was only equivalent to 8% of the global EV market and less than half of Tesla's 1.81 million deliveries. Therefore, it makes sense for Volkswagen to invest in smaller EV makers like Rivian to accelerate that higher-growth business.It's all about the cashAs for Rivian, that investment should allay some concerns about its cash flows and future projects. It still needs to open its $5 billion plant in Georgia; ramp up its production of its own Enduro drive units to boost its gross margins; launch its R2, R3, and R3X SUVs in 2026 and 2027; and fulfill Amazon's long-term order for 100,000 electric delivery vans through 2030.Rivian ended the first quarter of 2024 with $9.05 billion in total liquidity, but analysts expect it to post a net loss of $4.69 billion for the full year. Therefore, Volkswagen's big investment should buy it a lot more time to achieve its long-term goals. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said the partnership would secure its ""capital needs for substantial growth.""Rivian still looks undervaluedRivian expects its annual production to nearly flatline at 57,000 vehicles this year as it faces tougher macro headwinds, more competition, and a temporary shutdown of its main plant in Normal, Illinois, to upgrade its production capabilities. But it's still aiming to achieve a positive gross margin per vehicle by the fourth quarter of this year as economies of scale kick in.Analysts believe Rivian can increase its revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% from 2023 to 2026 as it rolls out its new vehicles. With an enterprise value of $12.6 billion, it still looks fundamentally cheap at just 3 times this year's sales. Tesla, which is growing at a much slower rate, trades at 8 times this year's sales.If Rivian can get its act together, ramp up its production, and avoid more delays and disappointments, it could fetch a much higher valuation in the future. Volkswagen's investment is a vote of confidence in its ability to achieve those goals -- and Rivian could generate big multibagger gains over the next few years if it overcomes its more pressing challenges.",0.0,False,"Rivian Automotive (RIVN), an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, has encountered difficulties since going public. However, the company has recently unveiled a significant development: a joint venture with Volkswagen aimed at co-developing new EV technologies. This partnership could potentially transform Rivian's prospects and mark a turning point for the company's future in the competitive EV market.",0.1950090527534485,False,"{'match_type': 'same', 'match_id': '5IGbsk1wFlDDwZH'}",,,,,,,,
4RiaKpeIPfv8xD8,USA Today,bing,The 2025 Toyota Camry SE sprinkles sporty affordability over new all-hybrid lineup,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2024/07/07/the-2025-toyota-camry-se-sprinkles-sporty-affordability-over-new-all-hybrid-lineup/74243576007/,2024-07-07 09:01,2024-07-07 09:06,AAPL,,"ProsExcellent value47 mpgHandsome designConsShort on headroomStressed under hard accelerationSmall cupholdersSedans might not be the hottest items in the automotive space right now, but when the best-selling midsize four-door gets a complete makeover and goes hybrid-only, it says a lot about the company making the vehicle and its future buyers. The 2025 Toyota Camry ditches its predecessor‚Äôs four- and six-cylinder engines and is only offered with a hybrid powertrain that delivers better power (and way better fuel economy) than the old entry-level engine, for not much more money than what competitors charge for their non-hybrid models.Besides becoming a hybrid-only vehicle, the Camry also receives a full redesign, taking lines from the handsome (and 2024 MotorTrend Car of the Year-winning) Prius. While our Camry‚Äôs Underground Dark Gray color didn‚Äôt shine as brightly as other available colors, it‚Äôs easy to spot the various styling changes and Toyota‚Äôs new design language that‚Äôs more upscale and premium.2025 Honda Odyssey:Everything we know about the next minivanThe Camry is known for its comfort, spaciousness and efficiency, and the 2025 model improves on every single area. We‚Äôre happy to report that the updated car is a nice step up over the outgoing model, achieving better fuel economy, adding more space and improving ride quality, and it still delivers tremendous value, with pricing starting at $29,495 for the more reserved-looking LE model.Take the family with youThough crossovers have been the family vehicle of choice lately, the Camry has plenty of space for five people. One of the things that we‚Äôre most impressed with is legroom for the second row; there is plenty for adults even with three people in the back. Headroom is a different story. Anyone around 6-foot-3 or below shouldn‚Äôt have any issues, but that‚Äôs without a sunroof. As we discussed in our Camry XLE AWD review, the sunroof eats a surprisingly noticeable 0.8 inch of headroom, which can be bothersome for taller folks.The midgrade SE model gets sportier styling and wheels than the basic LE, along with well-padded leatherette (faux leather) seats that don't get too hot after sitting under the sun all day. The leatherette feels closer to what we‚Äôre used to seeing in a premium car rather than a midgrade Camry, but that touch of luxury is offset by the somewhat cheap-looking gray cloth inserts on the door panels and dashboard.Our test car came with the $735 multimedia upgrade package, which includes a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. This is a nice step up over the standard 8.0-inch touchscreen. A 7.0-inch screen takes over most of the driver‚Äôs instrument cluster and is a good improvement over the outgoing model‚Äôs smaller and more dated-looking digital readout. We are also fans of the trim around the infotainment screen, which makes the dashboard look longer and wider.Overall, the Camry is great in the comfort and convenience department, though one thing we wish it had was wider cupholders, as the ones in the center console don‚Äôt fit a 32-ounce water bottle, and the door panels don‚Äôt have space for one either.Driving the CamryAll Camrys share the same hybrid powertrain regardless of the trim level. For now, there are no plans to bring a Prime (plug-in hybrid) version like that offered on the RAV4 and Prius, but with more power than before, only those who have a previous-generation V-6 Camry already in the garage will want more power out of the new generation.The 2025 Camry is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a permanent-magnet electric motor and a starter/generator that deliver 225 hp combined. This output is mixed in a planetary-type continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) and delivered to the Camry‚Äôs front tires; all-wheel-drive variants like the one we recently tested add another electric motor to the rear axle and make 232 hp combined.Even the front-drive combination delivers plenty of power to the front wheels, making the Camry feel peppy around town, but at full-throttle it can feel stressed-out. The CVT does a decent job metering power in a linear way, and in conjunction with the engine‚Äôs rising revs manages to deliver a natural feel. The 225 ponies show up at the track, too; the 2025 Camry SE gets to 60 mph in 7.0 seconds, an improvement of 0.8-second over a last-generation Camry Hybrid SE we tested. The AWD 2025 Camry is just a hair quicker, reaching 60 mph in 6.9 seconds.It takes some time to get used to the Toyota‚Äôs brake pedal, as the ABS system gets choppy when slowing down from high speeds. The brakes‚Äô initial bite can be a bit too intense for city driving, too, but we grew used to it after a day or two behind the wheel. Stopping distances are just fine, with the Camry SE slowing from 60 mph in 125 feet ‚Äî a curious 9 feet longer than the heavier all-wheel-drive Camry XLE we recently tested.The Camry SE (and better-equipped XSE) are differentiated from the more comfort-focused LE and XLE trims by sport-tuned springs and dampers and larger-diameter anti-roll bars for sharper handling and responses. Road test editor Chris Walton finds the Camry ‚Äúsporty‚Äù and ‚Äúimpressive‚Äù on the skidpad, though on the figure eight lap test it‚Äôs no quicker than the old model, completing the run in 27.0 seconds at an average of 0.62 g, slightly slower than the 2023 Camry SE‚Äôs 26.7 seconds at 0.65.Toyota FJ Cruiser pickup:This is the FJ truck that Toyota should have builtWhile the Camry SE has a more dynamic feel than the LE or XLE models, it‚Äôs still comfortable to drive every day, as you‚Äôd expect a Camry to be. Toyota made this model snazzier to behold, but it‚Äôs still serene and pleasant to drive on the road.Why the Camry SE is the best value for your moneyWith a starting price of $31,795, the 2025 Camry SE costs $2,300 more than the Camry LE yet still delivers a ton of value. With its standard hybrid powertrain returning 48 mpg city, 47 mpg highway and 47 mpg combined, it‚Äôs efficient, but that‚Äôs not all. Comforts and conveniences such as standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, wireless charging and dual-zone climate control are shared with lesser LEs, but the SE adds those faux leather seats (power-adjustable driver‚Äôs perch), stylish 18-inch wheels and sportier body addenda, and that sport suspension for a sharper appearance and handling.Looking at the hybridized midsize sedan competition, the 2024 Honda Accord Hybrid starts at $33,990 (though cheaper versions with gas-only power are available), while the 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid (again, nonhybrid Sonatas are cheaper) starts at $31,915. The Camry is alone in going all-hybrid, of course, and we‚Äôll need to toss it into a proper comparison test with its rivals to see whether that bold choice pays off. For now, the Camry SE is actually enjoyable to drive and look at (a mold first broken by the previous Camry) and just so happens to be a satisfyingly powerful yet fuel-sipping hybrid, too. If you‚Äôd like that combination to be affordable, the SE is the way to go. Have more money to swing around? The XSE and XLE deliver similar goods with more equipment.Photos by Renz Dimaandal",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
ogIPsnIg18fHj2M,Seeking Alpha,google,5 Things To Consider Ahead Of Wells Fargo's Q2 2024 Earnings (NYSE:WFC),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702763-5-things-to-consider-ahead-of-wells-fargos-q2-2024-earnings,2024-07-07 09:00,2024-07-07 09:14,WFC,,"jetcityimageIn the three months since it reported first-quarter results, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) traded in a narrow range. WFC stock traded between $57.00 - $61.00, struggling to break out above $60. Despite a strong quant rating of 4.95 out of 5.0, markets are looking for positive catalysts that would justify a rally. What should shareholders expect from the second-quarter earnings report? There are five things to consider ahead of its Q2 report scheduled for Friday. The firm will release its report alongside its peers, Citigroup (C), BNY Mellon (BK), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) that day before markets open. 1/ Review of Q1/2024 Results In the first quarter, Wells Fargo met Wall Street√¢¬Ä¬ôs consensus estimates. It posted healthy credit quality, provision for credit losses (""PCL"") significantly below estimates, and strong earnings. The bank earned $1.20 a share, compared to $1.23 Y/Y. Had it excluded an FDIC special assessment, first-quarter earnings would have been $1.26, well ahead of the $1.09 average analyst estimate. Its PCL of $938 million fell from $1.28 billion in Q4, but is above the $1.21 billion reported in Q1/2023. This contrasts with struggling Canadian banks. Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) reported higher credit provisions, citing uncertain macroeconomic conditions. It also blamed the impact of sustained higher interest rates hurting various client segments. Bank of Montreal (BMO) posted a sharply higher PCL of C$705 million, up from C$318 million year-on-year. Wells Fargo achieved lower net loan charge-offs related to auto losses in the quarter. This is a result of tightening actions it implemented starting in late 2021. Wells Fargo Q1 2024In the quarter, net interest income fell by $1.1 billion, or 8% Y/Y. Higher interest rates harmed funding costs. Customers moved to higher-yielding deposit products while lowering their loan balances.   Wells Fargo Q1After the government posted the lowest level of payroll growth in over a year, the Federal Reserve will more readily lower interest rates by 25 bps sometime in 2024. This should boost Wells Fargo√¢¬Ä¬ôs net interest margins in future quarters. 2/ Dividend Increase and Stock Buyback After passing the Federal Reserve√¢¬Ä¬ôs 2024 stress test, Wells Fargo said that it expects its stress capital buffer to be 3.8%. Since it will have capital above the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the firm expects to increase its dividend by 14% to $0.40 per share. Based on a closing price of $59.62, the dividend will have a forward yield of 2.68%. By comparison, BMO stock pays a dividend that yields 5.31%. Scotiabank pays a dividend that yields 6.85% annually. Its yield increased after the stock fell from a $51.98 high in April 2024 to trade recently at $45.21. Wells Fargo will also increase shareholder returns by buying back shares. This starts in the third quarter of 2024 through Q2/2025. Investors will need to wait until Friday√¢¬Ä¬ôs report to find out the size of the buyback program. 3/ Second-Quarter Earnings Forecast In Q2, 19 analysts raised their earnings per share estimate for Wells Fargo. This gives WFC stock a revisions grade of B+. Seeking AlphaThe consensus EPS is $1.28, up by 2.69% year-on-year. The small expected increase suggests that Friday√¢¬Ä¬ôs earnings release will not move the stock. Last quarter, WFC was already the third top-performing bank stock of 2024. Still, it outperformed Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Bank of America (BAC). Seeking Alpha Investors who held SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE), however, are almost break-even in 2024. WFC stock is not among the top holdings. First Trust Nasdaq Bank ETF (FTXO) is an alternative holding. Wells Fargo is an 8.21% weighting. Invesco KBW Bank (KBW) is a better choice. Its assets under management are $1.53 billion. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America, and Wells Fargo are each at least 8% of assets or higher. 4/ Wells Fargo's Stock Grades Wells Fargo and Bank of America both have a strong buy quant rating. The four U.S. banks have nearly identical year-to-date returns of 20% or more. I included the two Canadian banks in the comparison since I compared their PCL to that of Wells Fargo earlier in the article. Seeking AlphaWells Fargo scores poorly only on valuation. Just like BAC stock, it scores well on growth, profitability, momentum, and EPS revisions. Seeking AlphaThe valuation scoring system appears to penalize Wells for its dividend yield of 2.35%. However, after the dividend hike increases the yield, the valuation grade should improve to a C+. This would match Citi√¢¬Ä¬ôs value grade.   Seeking Alpha5/ Risks The bank mentioned longstanding issues among the regulatory pressures ahead. Additionally, its implementation of heightened controls and oversight may result in regulator actions. Furthermore, it has outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could contribute to operating losses. The firm may offset those risks by offering more low-risk financing products to its customers. This would improve its trading flow in future quarters. Your Takeaway  Investors have no reason to change their bullish outlook on Wells Fargo. The bank hiked its dividend and will buy back stock. This increases the attractiveness of the stock, especially as the Fed prepares to cut interest rates this year. After building support in the $40s since 2021, the uptrend that began last Nov. 2023 is unlikely to end. Helped by strong quarterly results, that sets up a rally to over $65, a price not seen since Jan. 22, 2018. Please [+]Follow me for coverage on deeply discounted stocks.

Semiannual testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday will also be a key focus for investors.On the corporate side, Friday morning will see some of America's largest financial institutions, including JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citi (C), kick off second quarter earnings season. Results from PepsiCo (PEP) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) will also be in focus earlier in the week.Last week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose nearly 2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied over 3%. Both finished the week at record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which has been a notable laggard all year, gained a more modest 0.5%.Case for a September rate cut buildsOn Friday, the June jobs report showed the US economy added more jobs than expected last month. But economists found several signs of a slowing labor market in the details of the report.The unemployment rate rose to 4.1%, its highest level since November 2021. Meanwhile, job gains for April and May were revised lower by 111,000, showing the labor market's robust gains over the past several months weren't as solid as initially thought.Several economists believe this print will lead the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September.""The June jobs report showed more signs of cooling in the labor market, with job growth including revisions weaker than expected, the unemployment rate rising and earnings growth slowing,"" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients.""Federal Reserve officials have become increasingly focused on the downside risks to the labor market and the June data bolster our forecast for the Fed to cut rates in September and at every other meeting thereafter.""Renaissance Macro's head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the report should ""firm up expectations of a September rate cut.""""Economic conditions are cooling and that makes the trade-offs different for the Fed,"" Dutta added, ""Powell should use July to set up a September cut.""Story continuesAs of Friday, investors were pricing in a roughly 75% the Fed cuts rates by its September meeting, up from a 64% chance seen the week prior, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.With Powell set to give his semiannual testimony on Capitol Hill this week, investors will be closely listening for any hints at policy moves ahead of its July 30-31 meeting.Read more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsPrice checkWhile the labor market's slowing has added to the case for Fed rate cuts, inflation remains a key factor.In May, inflation readings showed prices increased at their slowest pace of 2024. Powell remarked last week that those readings ""suggest that we are getting back on a disinflationary path.""The first test for whether that path will continue is set for release on Thursday morning with the June CPI report.Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 3.1% annually in June, a slowdown from the 3.3% rise seen in May. May's data was the slowest year-over-year inflation reading since July 2022. Prices are set to rise 0.1% on a month-over-month basis, a slight increase from the flat reading seen in May.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to rise 3.4% over last year in June, unchanged from May. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.2%.""We expect the June CPI report to be another confidence builder following the undeniably good May report,"" Bank of America US economist Stephen Juneau wrote in a research note previewing the release.Read more: Inflation fever breaking? Price hikes on everyday expenses finally ease up.Big banks set the stageEarnings season is upon us again, and Financials (XLF) will be in particular focus over the next few weeks; 40% of the S&P 500 companies set to report over that period will be from the sector, according FactSet.The sector isn't expected to be a leader in earnings growth this quarter, with analysts forecasting 4.3% year-over-year earnings growth in Q2. This places Financials seventh among the eleven sectors in the S&P 500 for earnings growth.As Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith recently reported, regional banks remain a key concern for the industry.

Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)A 'high bar' for Q2 earningsAfter climbing out of an earnings recession in 2023, corporates are finally facing a new challenge this reporting season: a high bar to beat.Consensus forecasts are for the S&P 500's earnings to grow 8.8% against the year prior in the second quarter, according to FactSet. This would mark the highest year-over-year earnings growth for the index since the first quarter of 2022.""We expect the magnitude of EPS beats to diminish as consensus forecasts set a higher bar than in previous quarters,"" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a client note previewing earnings season.With the market trading near record levels ahead of this reporting period, Kostin and other strategists are cautious about how much upside investors can expect if results top Wall Street expectations.Kostin noted that last quarter, companies that beat expectations saw their shares outperform the S&P 500 by 3 basis points in the following day of trading, well below the historical average of 100 basis points.Given that investor sentiment is still elevated entering this round of earnings, Kostin reasoned, ""the reward for beats should be smaller than average this quarter, although not as extreme as during the 1Q season.""Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert struck a similar tone, warning that given ""lofty implied growth expectations,"" the prospect of large stock pops this quarter is limited.""Markets likely need to see raises coupled with solid execution driven beats to sustain recent gains or push higher from here,"" Chronert wrote in a weekly research note on Friday. ""The concern is while fundamental trends are positive and consensus estimates are attainable, valuations suggest the buy-side will demand more.""Broadly, this has Wall Street tampering expectations about how much higher second quarter earnings reports could send a stock market.Research from Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha showed that the S&P 500 rises 80% of the time during earnings season, with an average return of 2%.""On the other hand,"" Chadha noted, ""the market run up into earnings season and overweight equity positioning argue for a muted rally.""Weekly calendarMondayEconomic data: New York Fed 1-year inflation expectations, June (3.17% prior)Earnings: No notable earnings releases.TuesdayEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, June (89.9 expected, 90.5 prior); Fed Chair Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Committee.Earnings: Helen of Troy (HELE)WednesdayEconomic data: MBA mortgage applications, July 5, (-2.6% prior), Wholesale inventories month-over-month, May final (0.6% prior); Fed Chair Powell testifies before the House Financial Services CommitteeEarnings: Manchester United (MANU), WD-40 (WDFC), PriceSmart (PSMT)ThursdayEconomic data: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, +0% previously); CPI excluding food and energy, month-over-month, June (+0.2% expected, +0.2% previously); Consumer Price Index, year-over-year, June (+3.1% expected, +3.3% previously); CPI excluding food and energy, year-over-year, June (+3.4% expected, +3.4% previously); Real Average Hourly Earnings, year-over-year, June (+0.7% previously); Real Average Weekly Earnings, year-over-year, June (+0.5% previously);Initial jobless claims, week ended July 6 (238,000 previously);Earnings: Conagra Brands (CAG), Delta Air Lines (DAL), PepsiCo (PEP), Progressive (PGR)FridayEconomic data: Producer Price Index, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, -0.2% previously); PPI, year-over-year, June (+2.2% previously); Core PPI, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, 0% previously); Core PPI, year-over-year, June (+2.3% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, July preliminary (67 expected, 68.2 previously)Earnings: BNY Mellon (BK), JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC)Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

H1wcB4nOquVIS31,Techcrunch,google,What happens if you shoot down a delivery drone?,https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/07/what-happens-if-you-shoot-down-a-delivery-drone/,2024-07-07 10:50,2024-07-07 10:55,AMZN,,"As deep-pocketed companies like Amazon, Google and Walmart invest in and experiment with drone delivery, a phenomenon reflective of this modern era has emerged. Drones, carrying snacks and other sundries, are being shot out of the sky.¬†Incidents are still rare. However, a recent arrest in Florida, in which a man allegedly shot down a Walmart drone, raises questions of what the legal ramifications are and whether those consequences could escalate if these events become more common.¬†In the Florida case, Walmart was conducting delivery demonstrations in Clermont, Florida ‚Äî roughly 25 miles west of Orlando ‚Äî when a loud sound was heard during the craft‚Äôs descent. According to the Lake County Sheriff‚Äôs Office, the suspect, Dennis Winn, allegedly admitted to shooting the drone. He allegedly told authorities this wasn‚Äôt his first experience with drones flying over and around his home, leading him to believe that the small, unmanned crafts might be spying on him.The man was charged with discharging a firearm and ‚Äúcriminal mischief‚Äù resulting in damage of more than $1,000. For its part, Walmart claims that the amount totaled around $2,500, primarily involving the drone‚Äôs payload system. It‚Äôs likely more drones will be shot down, considering the United States is home to more guns than people. And while last week‚Äôs incident isn‚Äôt without precedent, it‚Äôs not entirely clear how stiff the consequences could become.That‚Äôs due in large part to the fact that there haven‚Äôt been any high-profile cases wherein the shooter has received the maximum penalty. That could well change, however, as more multi-billion-dollar corporations stake their airspace. At this early stage, years of R&D costs coupled with very limited scalability means an extremely high per-drone price tag.In 2022, for instance, Amazon was estimated to be spending $484 for every delivery made by a Prime Air drone. The price has come down since; optimistic projections had the figure dropping to around $63 in 2025. Even that is still nearly 20x the price of the average ground delivery.Drone deliveries also haven‚Äôt scaled as quickly as Amazon had hoped. As of this writing, Prime Air is only available in one location ‚Äî College Station, Texas ‚Äî after operations ended in California. Two European locations and an another in the U.S. are set to arrive by the end of this year.While consumer drones have been proliferating for well over a decade, the question of legal ramifications hasn‚Äôt been wholly clear. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gave us a partial answer following a 2016 drone shooting in Arkansas. At the time, the FAA pointed interested parties to 18 U.S.C. 32. The law, titled ‚ÄúAircraft Sabotage,‚Äù is focused on the wanton destruction of ‚Äúany aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States or any civil aircraft used, operated or employed in interstate, overseas, or foreign air commerce.‚ÄùAt first glance, the law appears primarily focused on manned aircraft, including a provision that ‚Äúmakes it a Federal offense to commit an act of violence against any person on the aircraft, not simply crew members, if the act is likely to endanger the safety of the aircraft.‚Äù In responding to the Arkansas drone shooting, however, the FAA asserts that such protections can be interpreted to also include UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). The language does, indeed, appear broad enough to cover drones. That means, in turn, that the penalties are potentially as stiff.The subject was revived after a 2020 incident in Minnesota. In that case, the suspect was hit with felony charges relating to criminal damage and discharging a weapon within city limits. Those would likely also be the charges in most scenarios involving property, rather than bodily damage, drone or not. Even with these examples, there is not a rigid rule that predicts if or when prosecutors might also introduce a federal charge like 18 U.S.C. 32.As the legal blog Above the Law notes, in most cases, the federal government has deferred to state law for enforcement. Meanwhile, in most cases where 18 U.S.C. 32 has been applied, if a human crew/passengers are involved, there could be other potential charges like murder. It certainly can be argued that shooting a large piece of hardware out of the sky in a heavily populated area invites its own potential for bodily harm, though it may not be prosecuted in the same manner.As drone delivery increases in the U.S., however, we may soon have an answer to the role federal legislation like 18 U.S.C. 32 will play in UAV shootings. Adding that into the picture brings penalties, including fines and up to 20 years in prison, potentially compounding those consequences. What is clear, though, is that the consequences can be severe, whether it is invoked.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
xECpEetk3PkyjL3,Seeking Alpha,google,The Undervalued Volkswagen: Your Free Pass To Rivian's Success (OTCMKTS:VWAPY),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702795-the-undervalued-volkswagen-your-free-pass-to-rivians-success?source=google_editors_picks,2024-07-07 12:24,2024-07-07 12:26,RIVN,,"garett_mosher/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Value investors who have read the early investments made by legendary investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch probably experience a little bit of envy about some of the extraordinary opportunities that existed at that time. One example was Buffett's investment in the Sanborn Map Company, where at one point Buffett allocated nearly 35% of the portfolio. While the core map business was experiencing declining profitability, the company had an investment portfolio of high-quality stocks valued at roughly $65 per share, while its shares were trading at roughly $45. In other words, the map business was valued at a negative $20 per share. While it has become extremely difficult to find such clear value investing opportunities in the U.S., where valuations have become extremely stretched, it is a little bit easier in markets where valuations have remained closer to historical averages. Case in point, Volkswagen Group (OTCPK:VWAPY)(OTCPK:VWAGY), which, considering they own 75% of Porsche AG's (OTCPK:DRPRY)(OTCPK:DRPRF) capital, and almost 90% of Traton SE's (OTCPK:TRATF), investors are roughly paying negative $10 billion for the rest of Volkswagen. We are not the only ones to have noticed, with Barron's pointing out in an article last year that Volkswagen stock was ""practically free"". If the company was losing money, perhaps it would be understandable, but the company remains profitable and it has a very credible plan to transition towards electric vehicles. In other words, investors are basically being paid to own Volkswagen's other brands, including its namesake, Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, SEAT, CUPRA, Ducati, √Ö¬†koda, and investments in other public companies. These other investments include a 5% stake in Xpeng (XPEV) bought for $700 million in 2023, and the recently announced $5 billion investment in Rivian (RIVN). The investment in Rivian is a little complicated, with only $1 billion to be invested this year, $1 billion in 2025, and another $1 billion in 2026, with the remaining $2 billion allocated to their joint venture. Therefore, the final shareholding Volkswagen will have in Rivian will depend on how its share price develops over the coming years. Still, it is likely Volkswagen will become one of Rivian's largest owners. Data by YCharts Share Classes One thing Volkswagen is not is a simple company, that includes the different ways to invest in the company. The company has voting shares, which trade under the symbol VOW in Germany, and preferred shares with the symbol VOW3. The preferred shares are really more similar to non-voting shares than what U.S. investors normally associate with preferred stock. The difference is similar to Alphabet's (GOOGL) voting shares, which have voting rights, and its non-voting shares (GOOG). The corresponding OTC ADRs in the U.S. are VWAGY for the voting shares, and VWAPY for the preferred non-voting ones. Despite the non-voting shares paying a slightly higher dividend, they tend to trade at a lower price. This has not always been the case, as can be seen below, but the non-voting shares have only traded higher for brief periods of time. Further complicating things, it is also possible to invest in Volkswagen indirectly through Porsche SE (OTCPK:POAHY)(OTCPK:POAHF), which is a holding company that owns about 31% of Volkswagen's capital, has roughly 53% of its voting rights, a smaller stake in Porsche AG, and some VC type investments. Data by YCharts Competitive Moat We believe Volkswagen has two competitive advantages that will help it fend off competition to a certain degree, even if the automotive sector is known as a very tough industry. One is its enormous economies of scale, with only Toyota Motors (TM) producing more cars annually. The second is the value of its premium brands, which give the company strong pricing power. Volkswagen Investor Presentation In fact, Porsche has been considered the most valuable luxury brand in the world. Ferrari (RACE) is considered less valuable, despite the high premiums the brand commands, given the significantly lower volumes produced. Other brands that give Volkswagen premium pricing power include Lamborghini, Bentley, and Audi. In fact, Volkswagen is considered to have a similar market share of the premium market to that of rivals BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY) and Mercedes-Benz Group (OTCPK:MBGYY). Volkswagen Investor Presentation Rivian Investment and Partnership One reason we are excited about the Rivian investment and partnership, is that it might help solve one of the big issues Volkswagen has been fighting: software bugs. Volkswagen calls its automotive software division CARIAD, and it had previously disclosed it had plans for a comprehensive re-alignment of this business segment. It therefore makes complete sense to join forces with Rivian, which we believe has strong automotive software development skills, even if Volkswagen already has its wholly-owned electric pick-up startup Scout. For Rivian, Volkswagen's investment gives it a credible path towards profitability, which is expected to happen once the company starts delivering its mass-market R2. Rivian recently had its investor day, and we were impressed with the presentation, the advanced software functionalities, and the planned cost reductions. Rivian Investor Day While Rivian is expecting a meaningful cost reduction for its second generation R1 model, it is really the R2 where a major improvement is expected. If things go according to plan, it is possible that the company could achieve profitability with the R2. While we see enormous potential with Rivian, there is also significant risk as the company continuous burning cash at a rapid pace. Right now we are happy having an indirect exposure to Rivian through Volkswagen, especially considering that at the current Volkswagen valuation, it appears to be basically given for free. Rivian Investor Day Financials The Q1 financial results the company reported at the end of April were not particularly good, with the company itself saying that, ""Q1 was never going to be our best quarter"". Part of the reason is that the company's most important product launches are scheduled for later in 2024, particularly for the Audi and Porsche brands. It is also taking some time for the Volkswagen brand efficiency program to deliver results, in part due to wage increases started in 2023, and are not showing their full impact. Still, the company managed to deliver √¢¬Ç¬¨75.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, which is a decrease of only about 1% year-over-year. Volkswagen also experienced some supply shortages that affected Audi vehicles with V6 and V8 engines. Despite significant headwinds over the past decade, including some of its own making like the emissions scandal, the company has managed to grow revenue and restore profitability. More recent headwinds included the initial impact of the COVID pandemic, and currently the higher interest rate environment impacting potential customers that would have considered buying a new car using a loan. The company has been particularly open about its disappointment with the operating margin its namesake brand is generating and has an efficiency plan aimed at significantly increasing the VW brand's margin to ~6.5% by 2026, from the ~3.6% it delivered in 2022. Reducing losses in the software division (CARIAD) should also significantly help improve profit margins. Data by YCharts Robo-taxi Strategy It will come as a surprise to some investors, but Tesla (TSLA) is not the only company with a robo-taxi strategy. Volkswagen's strategy is, however, more similar to Microsoft's (MSFT) AI strategy in the sense that it depends on strategic partnerships. For example, Microsoft has invested in and made exclusivity deals with OpenAI and Mistral, while Volkswagen is working with the likes of Mobileye (MBLY) and Qualcomm (QCOM). We think Rivian is likely to help in some way as well, as they are also working on autonomous driving technology. Volkswagen Investor Presentation Trucks As mentioned at the start, Volkswagen did a partial IPO of its truck business, which was well received and has been doing well operationally. For example, in the most recent earnings call, management shared that Scania is operating with double-digit profit margin once again. With Traton SE showing a market cap of ~$16.7 billion, it is a significant asset for the company. Volkswagen is therefore considering selling more shares to increase the free float, and generate cash for other investments. Volkswagen Investor Presentation PowerCo One division that will certainly require more investment is the battery company, which Volkswagen has named PowerCo, and which it plans to eventually introduce to the stock market too. Volkswagen's ambition is for PowerCo to become a global battery champion, with economies of scale unlocking cost advantages. It is currently planning three factories, one in Canada, one in Spain, and another one in Germany. It believes this business could eventually supply approximately 50% of Volkswagen's battery needs. It is planning for up to ~200 GWh capacity in 2030, and believes it can deliver EBIT margins above 10%.  While the company plans to be flexible in terms of technology, it is working closely with QuantumScape (QS), in which Volkswagen has previously invested and had a 17% equity stake at the end of 2023. In early 2024, PowerCo and QuantumScape announced promising results from the testing of some of QuantumScape's solid state batteries. Volkswagen is also evaluating LFP battery technology which is expected to reduce battery costs by one-third. Improvements in battery costs are critical for the company to achieve cost parity with Chinese battery electric vehicle (BEV) leaders by 2026. The Volkswagen 2023 annual report also shows a 23% equity interest in one of Europe's most talked about clean tech startups, Northvolt AB. Northvolt is also planning several gigafactories in several different locations. Volkswagen Investor Presentation China When it comes to China, for Volkswagen its the best of times and its the worst of times. On the one hand they have become the #1 foreign automaker in the country, but on the other hand they are facing steep competition from fierce EV makers. In some cases these EV competitors have found ways to produce electric cars at surprisingly low prices, such as BYD (OTCPK:BYDDF), in part thanks to their vertical integration and advances in areas such as battery technology and software development. Still, we think being forced to compete with these Chinese companies is a blessing in disguise for Volkswagen. It has forced the company to improve its efficiency and productivity, close technology gaps through joint ventures and partnerships, and work on a long-term strategy to remain profitable while fending off competition. Some of its competitors more focused on North America or Europe are simply lobbying for tariffs, which will only delay the inevitable. The horse-and-buggy industry could have lobbied extremely hard and perhaps delayed the transition, but cars were eventually going to win. In any case, Volkswagen is coming up with very compelling models on its Premium Platform Electric (PPE), with the Audi Q6 e-tron and the Porsche Macan already generating significant excitement. Volkswagen Investor Presentation In 2023 Volkswagen even managed to slightly increase its already massive market share for internal combustion engine cars in China by a little over 1%, and importantly, it also increased its battery electric vehicle (BEV) market share by 2%. While 2% market share gain might not sound very significant, take into consideration that it took an almost doubling in its BEV sales to accomplish it given how fast EVs are growing in China. Despite the country already being the largest auto market in the world, Volkswagen still sees opportunity for growth given that China's cars per capita is still significantly below most developed economies. Volkswagen Investor Presentation However, the company is well aware that most of that growth will come from EVs, and that they need to be able to also compete at lower price points. The company therefore needs to reach cost parity with the local BEV leaders, which it expects to accomplish by 2026. This will come from cost reductions from new battery technology and increasing the use of local R&D skills, as well as partnerships with companies like Xpeng. Volkswagen Investor Presentation Tough Competition As can be seen in a YouTube TLDR Business video, in 2011, Elon Musk laughed hard when asked about the risk that Chinese rival BYD (OTCPK:BYDDF) posed to Tesla. He is probably laughing a lot less now that BYD is outselling Tesla some quarters. The point is that competition with Chinese auto manufacturers is going to be fierce, and companies will need to continuously innovate and lower costs if they want to retain their market share. Of course, this is not only a problem for Tesla but for the entire industry, and it is one of the reasons many auto manufacturers are trading with extremely depressed valuations. TLDR Business Balance Sheet The transition to electric vehicles, building the required gigafactories, and investing in autonomous driving and other advanced software features is going to be expensive. Fortunately Volkswagen's balance sheet is in good shape, even if some investors worry that the company has too much debt. Most of the debt is related to the financial services arm of the company that provides auto loans and leasing services. The automotive net liquidity at the end of Q1 was √¢¬Ç¬¨37.2 billion, clearly a very significant sum. Data by YCharts Looking specifically at the financial services divisions, we are reassured by their excellent investment grade credit ratings by S&P Global (SPGI) and Moody's (MCO).   Volkswagen Group Investors should not be surprised if this debt continues to increase as the company provides more loans or leases to customers. Volkswagen has even provided guidance as to how they expect the balance sheet to grow in the coming years. Investors should simply remember that this debt has collateral, and that the financial arm has usually been a source of profits for the company.   Volkswagen Investor Presentation Outlook During the earnings call management sounded confident about its fiscal year 2024 guidance, pointing to an order book that currently stands at 1.1 million cars and a massive increase in the order intake of BEVs of more than 100%. Volkswagen continue to expect revenue to grow by up to 5%, with an operating margin in the range of 7% to 7.5%. In order to meet guidance the company is factoring a step up of sales at Porsche and Audi based on the ramp-up of their new models. The company also confirmed its BEV share target of 9% to 11%. Looking further ahead, the company will have some attractive mass-market EV options, including the recently revealed √Ö¬†koda EPIC which will be available starting in 2026 at a very attractive price of around √¢¬Ç¬¨25,000. Volkswagen Investor Presentation Valuation To get an idea of how cheap Volkswagen shares have become, the dividend yield is above 8% for both VWAPY and VWAGY, despite the company having a policy of distributing only about 30% of earnings. Data by YCharts Shares are trading at less than a third of their book value, and even if we remove intangibles, they still trade at a roughly 30% discount to tangible book value. And we would argue that the goodwill in the balance sheet is probably quite real, considering the value of brands like Porsche, Lamborghini, and Audi, not to mention patents and other IP. Data by YCharts Most auto manufacturers are sporting low valuations, with most competitors trading with a price/sales ratio below 1. Still, Volkswagen has the lowest multiple even though we would argue it has a stronger position compared to many of its rivals. Tesla's price/sales multiple is 55x higher than Volkswagen's, and Ferrari's multiple is almost 70x higher. Data by YCharts If you think this valuation does not make any sense, you are not alone, as Morningstar (MORN) estimates Volkswagen's fair value at more than 3x current prices. For its part, Barron's published early this year an article on ""the mystery of Volkswagen's ridiculously low valuation."" According to Barron's calculations, after adjusting for net cash and leasing Volkswagen is basically trading for negative times earnings. Stellantis has a market capitalization of about $63 billion. Net of cash and leasing, that number is closer to $30 billion, leaving Stellantis shares trading for 2 times estimated 2024 earnings. BMW shares trade for about 3 times earnings. Ford Motor and Toyota shares both trade for about 4 times earnings, after adjustments, while GM stock trades for roughly 3 times. Yet Volkswagen shares trade for negative 3 times earnings. Risks Despite the extremely low valuation, investing in Volkswagen still comes with significant risks. The company has had serious issues with its software development and is in the process of restructuring CARIAD. It remains to be seen if they can right the ship, and if the Rivian partnership will provide much needed help in this area. Then there is the issue of fierce competition from Chinese, Japanese, and Korean auto manufacturers. While Volkswagen has very strong brands, its rivals often have labor and manufacturing cost advantages. The company is also less agile, and has to take several stakeholders into consideration, including labor groups that are part of its board. Finally, the company suffered significant reputational and financial damage from its emissions scandal, and it has to adapt to changing regulations around the world. The company has to face all these challenges at the same time that it has to work on the transition to EVs. Still, we see signs for optimism and believe that some of these risks are mitigated by the company's competitive advantages, such as its very strong brands and attractive designs. As the slide below shows, Volkswagen is delivering better sales growth compared to other foreign competitors in China, while local BEV manufacturers are seeing their profit margins significantly decrease. Volkswagen Investor Presentation Another area investors should keep an eye on is auto loan delinquencies. Volkswagen reported that operating results in Q1 for its Financial Services division fell by about a quarter to √¢¬Ç¬¨881 million or a 6% margin. According to management this decline reflects the continued normalization of used car prices and provisioning for residual value risk, as well as the significantly increased interest rates. Still, delinquent auto loans in markets like the U.S. are clearly trending higher and could further spike if the economy enters a recession. Data by YCharts Conclusion While the auto industry is not one we particularly like, there are times that the valuation becomes so depressed that it makes no sense. This is the type of situation many value investors dream of, like when Buffett purchased shares in a maps company for negative $20 per share after adjusting for their investment portfolio. Similarly, Volkswagen appears to be valued at negative $10 billion after adjusting for their holdings in Porsche AG and Traton SE. Which means that investors are being paid to take the rest of the company, including Lamborghini, Audi, PowerCo, and minority investments in companies like Rivian.

Endogenous and exogenous pressures require the definition of a strategy, and it seems that among QSRs, adapting to the time preferences of low-income guests is the most natural strategy. After all, there is direct competition with convenience stores. In this context, I invite you to take a deep dive into the strategies and recent developments of Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK), one of the big names in QSR with the peculiarity of having a large part of its units located in California, the epicenter of AB 1228. Before we begin our analysis I would like to talk a little more about the current situation before getting into the actual developments. First, no one is immune to the downturn and like almost the entire industry in the first quarter, Jack reported a sharp decrease in same-store-sales, both in its own stores (0.6%) and in franchises (2.6%). Del Taco, which is another concept owned by Jack, reported a decrease in SSS of 1.4% system-wide. Basically, with the drop in traffic, restaurants that had a positive SSS in the quarter needed to compensate for this factor with an increase in the average check. In Jack's case, the company even managed to increase the average check by 3.1%, but this was not enough to compensate for the 3.7% drop in traffic. Although we do not see major changes in operating costs for the Jack in the Box concept, with labor costs representing 30.6% of all quarterly revenue within the restaurants operated by the company, the company is going through a period of refranchising aiming to contain operational costs. In the Del Taco concept, for example, labor costs grew by 1.4%, reaching 34.9% of all revenue generated. Remember the '30/30/30 Rule'. This is generally the minimum acceptable standard when dealing with operating costs in restaurants. Probably aware of this, the company made some changes to the units' management models. In 2023, the company refranchised 5 Jack in the Box units and 16 Del Taco units. This year, even before the end of the first semester, the company refranchised 13 Del Taco units. This movement will probably have consequences in relation to the volume of revenue generated by the company, but it is an important movement that aims to contain costs in order to sustain growth without using an absurd amount of capital. Until last year, Del Taco was made up of 46% owned units and 54% franchised. At the moment, the concept has approximately 28% of its own units and 72% of franchised units. This movement should continue until the composition becomes similar to that of Jack in the Box, which in 2024 has 7% of its own units and 93% of franchises. Now that I've introduced the company's current situation, let's navigate topic by topic and understand how Jack is positioning itself within the industry Some generalities about the QSR situation in California and rising labor costs: How does this impact traffic and margins? With a large portion of its units located in California, I consider it important that we dedicate a section to understanding how the impacts of AB 1228 are affecting QSRs within the current dynamics of the restaurant industry. First take a look at the numbers. The state of California is Jack's main market, accommodating 949 units. This represents about 43% of all its units, ahead of Texas (with 584 units and representing 27% of total units) and Arizona (with 178 units and representing 8% of total units). When we look at the population/restaurant ratio we have very attractive numbers even with the large concentration of units in two states. There are 41,945 people per restaurant in California, 49,651 in Texas and 40,893 in Arizona. In Los Angeles alone, Jack has 42 units, six more than in San Diego. Given this high concentration of units, it is clear that setting the minimum wage at $20 per hour only in QSRs would have significant impacts for Jack. But before we look inside, I invite you to look outside. How does the minimum wage policy affect the segment? At the end of the day, as the famous French author Fr√É¬©d√É¬©ric Bastiat says, we must not end our investigation on what is seen, but we must seek to know what is not seen. Yes, the first basic observation (what you see) would be the decrease in traffic and the increase in labor costs. These labor costs need to be passed on if the company wants to keep its margins intact. But if guests are becoming increasingly price sensitive and there is a whole host of substitute products threatening the financial integrity of restaurant operations, that cost will be passed along with the bitter price of decreased traffic. Let's talk about decreasing traffic first. According to a very interesting survey by Placer.ai, fast-food chains within the state of California had weaker traffic than the national average in 10 of the 12 weeks after the law was enacted. This is clearly a sum of three interconnected factors. The first factor is due to substitute products. Convenience stores, bakeries and markets are taking a share of the restaurant market precisely because they present cheaper and sometimes just as appetizing options. According to Porter, substitute products have a very interesting task in the dynamics of industries and competitive strategy: they reduce the potential returns of an industry. And so we saw this happening in practice precisely with the low-income guest, but all the guests seem to be giving in little by little. Research by Technomic presents us with some impressive results regarding this fact. The number of people who visit restaurants at least once a week fell from 68% to 67%. When we looked at low-income guests we also saw a drop from 59% to 58%. On the other hand, when we look at convenience stores the scenario is very different. The percentage of customers who go to convenience stores increased from 57% to 59%, and when we look at low-income consumers, this number increased from 55% to 58%. The second factor is also clear as a sunny day. Labor costs needed to be passed on for the sake of earnings integrity. I'm not saying that the price increase started only when we saw an increase in labor costs, but well before that. As I said in my RBI analysis, many fast-food chains have raised prices at two and even three times inflation in the last ten years. This was the case with McDonald's (MCD) with a 100% increase in prices since 2014 and Popeyes increasing by 86%. Other chains like Wendy's (WEN) and Burger King (QSR) were a little more restrained and rose 55%. An important observation is that inflation in the same period was 31%. The third factor, and this is interesting because it represents a dynamic within California that differs from the rest of the country, is that the decline in QSR traffic is being pressured by the underlying increase in traffic at full-service restaurants. Also from the perspective of Placer.ai's research, we can note that traffic was positive in eight of the last twelve weeks, surpassing quick service restaurants in all periods analyzed. This indicates that there is a transfer of occasional guests who prioritize value and experience within the benefits they expect at the time of the meal (something that is much more present and malleable within full-service restaurants by their very nature). Everything in the end comes down to the value perceived by the guest. This is interesting because the national average of traffic at full-service restaurants has been quite different in the rest of the country in the last two months than within California, as shown in the following graph:   Placer.ai In finance we generally measure the cost-benefit of certain projects by relating the present value of cash flows to the initial cost, whereas in marketing everything is more subjective. The cost-benefit index for consumers has to do with the relationship between expected benefits and perceived value. If guests have the opportunity to enjoy a full-service meal with all the underlying benefits that such a restaurant offers for a price just a little higher than a QSR, the answer becomes obvious and explains this phenomenon caused by the increase in the minimum wage within California and the situation we see today. Putting this discussion once again under 'Porterian' terms we have a substantial competitive advantage in favor of full-service restaurants within the state. If you've read my previous reviews, you know that this dynamic between limited-service restaurants and full-service restaurants only occurs within California. We have plenty of examples to confirm this. Companies like BJ's (BJRI), Chuy's (CHUY), First Watch (FWRG), Olive Garden and the entire portfolio of Darden (DRI) concepts except Longhorn, Dine Brands (DIN) and many other service restaurant chains complete showed a decline in traffic. Speaking specifically about Jack now, we know that the company is committed to offering an attractive value offer, recognizing the need to adjust price-based promotions to navigate this scenario. At the end of the day, QSRs are closer to competing with convenience stores than the broader value proposition offered by full-service restaurants, so when it comes to limited-service restaurants there is almost an overwhelming need to bring back the low-income guests, and that's what Jack seems to admit. We will talk about promotions later. Within this context we saw the company's SSS drop 2.5% system-wide, mainly driven by the decrease in traffic. This number worsens when we consider franchises, which had a SSS reduction of approximately 2.6%. Meanwhile, company-owned restaurants had a 0.6% lower SSS. Now talking about labor costs and how this impacted margins this last quarter, we have the following overview:   Total revenue (Own restaurants and franchises) and operating costs (Author) Unlike most restaurants, in the last quarter Jack was able to proportionally reduce labor expenses as its revenue from its own restaurants decreased. That is, through the franchise model the company is reducing labor costs. Proportionally in the quarter, Jack reduced labor costs by 1.64%, and the same panorama was seen in the other operational cost centers. Now, when we relate revenue from own operations to labor expenses, we obtain a proportion of 32% in the second quarter of 2023 which increased by less than 0.5%. In a simpler way, we can say that Jack is 'leveraging' its franchise model to absorb the rise in labor costs, reducing the pressure on its financial resources. To summarize this dynamic, we can infer that despite the increased pressure on labor costs, Jack is optimizing the management of this cost center and increasing the performance of its franchise model, even when this reduces revenue from its own operations, managing to transfer part of these costs and preserving the integrity of its operations. Regarding slow traffic, with the imminent price increase to contain costs, it is expected that this trend will continue to repeat itself as long as macroeconomic pressures remain tight and low-income guests are kept away by substitute products and full service restaurants (the latter specifically within California). In this scenario, it is important that we take a look at the mix of promotions and other developments that serve as an attraction for low-income guests, and that is what we will discuss in the following section. How does Jack fit into an environment focused on financial efficiency and price-based promotions? To start, let's take a look at Jack's mix of promotions. We know that management is committed to the return of traffic and low-income guests, which is essential for the operation of the QSR and the maintenance of traffic. After all, this is a volume-oriented segment, with few opportunities to add value through its dynamic, streamlined nature and a price-sensitive guest. At the end of May, Jack launched its 'Munchies Under $4' promotion. This promotion consists of a menu of selected items with great appeal for less than $4. The promotion includes Jr. Jumbo Jack, Tiny Tacos, French Toast Sticks, and the new Sourdough Grilled Cheese, among other options. The new promotion is clearly targeted at low-income guests, in the same vein as other fast-food chains we've seen recently. This is a strategy that aims to influence the balance of forces within the QSR segment, presenting a strategy that aims to combat the actual causes of traffic reduction. If you are paying attention to the industry, you will remember that almost all of Jack's direct competitors also established segmented promotions for the most price-sensitive guest. Burger King launched and promised to maintain the ""Eat Like a King"" promotion until the end of the year, which consists of choosing a sandwich option from three available (Chicken Jr., Whopper Jr. or Bacon Cheeseburger), fries, nuggets and drinks, all for $5. Popeyes, which is also an RBI brand, has reintroduced its ""Big Box"" with two pieces of fried chicken, a choice of side and a lentil biscuit for $6.99. Wendy's with breakfast for $3 and the ""Biggie Bag"", offering a similar offer to Burger King, but with upscaling options ranging from $4 to $6. McDonald's also launched a McChicken or McDouble promotion with nuggets, fries and a drink for $5 in June, lasting an estimated month, despite some claims from franchisees that were circumvented through a deal with Coca Cola (KO). . There are many examples, we could spend a good amount of time talking about them. But the most important fact is that Jack is acting reactively to market movements, and this demonstrates that the company is committed to bringing low-income guests back to restaurants. The efficiency of using the park is also being considered by the company. Wendy's, for example, has been relying on its off-premises sales in the mornings, which have proven to be an interesting weapon for generating alternative sources of revenue in historically slower periods. We also have some developments of this type at Jack. First in the morning, the company made Toast Sticks a permanent item on the menu and believes that this inclusion will gradually strengthen the park in the morning on a consistent basis. During the evening, management also believes they have a chance to gain market share, mainly by reintroducing Chick-n-Tater Melt and marketing efforts. The most interesting thing here is that Jack is not living off promotions alone. We talked a little about 'barbell menu strategy' and how this is especially important in the current scenario. In early 2024, the company launched the Smashed Jack Burger, made with seasoned beef, topped with grilled onions, thick pickles and a new sauce called Boss Sauce, served on a buttery brioche bun. The pricing is more attractive to 'premium' guests and serves as an interesting lever to increase the average check. It turns out that after a very strong launch, the supplier halted production, forcing Jack to halt sales until the supply chain stabilized in March. After its return, the Smashed Jack Burger helped catapult the average check by 2%, which is curious to say the least. I believe that Jck got the pricing right for Smashed, as it is at a threshold where low-income guests can still try it while still guaranteeing a significant cash inflow when compared to promotions. And often the cash inflow is as significant as substantial margins. New POS, new possibilities In the digital field I see Jack still a little behind its direct competitors. Around 13% of all its sales are in the digital environment. RBI, for example, increased its sales in digital channels from $13 billion in 2022 to $14 billion in 2023, an increase of almost 8% across all its brands. Burger King US alone showed 40% growth in the digital channel, which represents around 27% of all total sales. At Popeyes, approximately 25% of all sales are made through digital channels. At YUM! Brands (YUM), we saw a 25% increase in digital sales over the same period, with Taco Bell achieving an impressive 31% increase in digital sales. Wendy's, slightly above Jack in this sense, reached the mark of 14.5% of its total sales through digital channels. As you can see, there is no shortage of examples. In the digital field, another very interesting development is the integration of the new POS, called Qu. If you read my review of Dine Brands and how the integration of data collected by Tray POS is being used to generate IHOP in-app purchasing suggestions and how this is helping to increase the average check per guest, I highly recommend strongly reading. These are ways in which restaurants can adopt data management and artificial intelligence to generate extra sales, and this is the future for the industry, there is no way around it. But what are the benefits of this new POS for Jack, and how will the reach of digital sales enhance the guest experience? First of all, the new POS will aid in operational efficiency in routine tasks such as integration of payment methods, order management, kitchen management, staff management for peak hours, effective implementation of self-service kiosks, menu management and of stocks. Note that in the long term, after the complete integration of the restaurants with the new POS, more accurate management of these processes will help Jack to expand its margins and achieve stronger results. It is interesting how almost all players are developing process management solutions that involve integrating the POS with some AI system that assists daily processes. We can give some examples of this. BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) is a chain of casual dining restaurants that is standing out by improving its profit margin by adopting processes that benefit its operational efficiency, especially after PW Partners adapted the company's cost structure. Integrating your POS with the AI √¢¬Ä¬ã√¢¬Ä¬ãtool allows you to identify the busiest days in advance, so managers at the unit level can make decisions that increase the efficiency of operations. Another interesting example is the case of Starbucks (SBUX). With queue management problems in recent times, mainly due to the complexity of preparing customizable drinks and logistics with ice, the company developed the 'Siren Craft System'. This system is basically an update of the same one the company used in 2022 and consists of three distinct fronts. The first relates to the adoption of new preparation routines. The second is the creation of the 'Peak Play Caller' employee figure, who can change roles according to traffic needs. And the third is the integration of AI-based predictive tools with the POS to detect critical moments for the formation of very long queues and increased waiting times. When we talk about POS integrations with AI for suggestions for online sales platforms like IHOP, we still don't have a concrete forecast, but the most important fact for Jack is that this is now achievable. Remodeling and lean units: a point of convergence As I have always said in my analyses, the development of lean units is more than desirable, it is necessary. With a very mature industry and profitability being sucked up by substitute products and high entry barriers related to economies of scale, industry managers are increasingly valuing expansion projects through units with a higher cost-benefit ratio and a lower payback. In fact, in my last text in which I wrote about First Watch, one of my points of criticism was precisely the underutilization of assets and the lack of projects aimed at lean units, despite developing some very interesting renovations in the kitchen. And don't think that even within the theme of lean units there is no differentiation, quite the opposite. Bloomin' (BLMN), for example, underwent a broad project in 2023 to remodel and close Outback units that were not performing satisfactorily, which became known as the ""2023 Closing Project"", where 10 of its own units were closed in the United States, all of which were units of old models. On the other hand, in 2021 Bloomin' developed a type of unit called ""Joey"", which is 4,800 to 5,000 square feet. Approximately 16 Joey units were opened in Brazil in 2023. Dine Brands, in contrast to smaller units with greater reach to lower volume markets, developed the dual-branded unit, which interconnects an IHOP unit with an Applebee's unit contiguously, without internal partitions. Note that this model optimizes the park at different times for the two concepts, as each one has its own peculiarities regarding peak traffic hours, however its implementation is not lean, quite the contrary, opening costs are even bigger. Once again, there are many examples. For Jack we have the 'CRAVED' model. The plan is for the company to achieve a net growth of 2% per year in relation to the number of units, with all new openings using the same prototype, which is already being used in Mexico, where Jack opened its first unit in the second quarter and is already attracting the attention of operators, according to the CEO. The 'CRAVED' model has an estimated payback of less than five years and is already being implemented in 88 restaurants that are at some point in their development phase. To have some basis for comparison in relation to the estimated payback of the 'CRAVED' model, which is 5 years or less, let's take a look at some projects that I have been following. Portillo's (PTLO), a fast-casual chain recently released some data about its ""Units of the Future"", developed to spearhead its accelerated expansion project. The company currently has paybacks of 8 years for units in the Midwest, 7 years for units in the Sunbelt and 4 years for a unit in Chicagoland. After the introduction of lean units (scheduled for 2025), paybacks would decrease to 6, 5 and 3 years respectively. A five-year payback is what most restaurants want when developing lean units. This generally means a decrease of two to three years in the payback of an average volume project. Along the same lines and with an average payback of five years, there are also the new units of Potbelly (PBPB) and Walk-On's Sports Bistreaux. Therefore, I see the 'CRAVED' units as a good sign that the company is acting proactively within the new industry requirements. This is a sign that there is the possibility of expansion in the medium term, perhaps internationally. Some considerations about financing and investments Before formulating my thesis for Jack, I would like to establish some comparisons about the company's profitability. To do this, I would like to examine some metrics that will help us discover how Jack behaves in relation to some direct competitors. Let's do this quickly so we don't go on too long: Author At first glance we can notice a decrease in the rate of return using operating cash flow. That is, in simplified terms, the company is generating a lower cash return in the last twelve months than before. But how did this happen if net profit did not show anomalous variations during this period. Simple, the OCF for the last twelve months was directly impacted by an accumulation of operating accounts, more precisely due to receivables. For the first time in two years, Jack presented a negative operating cash flow, and this occurred at the end of last year, accumulating $107.5 million in operating assets that needed to be covered through investment in current assets and consequently reduced the OCF. In the last quarter, Jack still had its OCF reduced by just over $3 million for the same reason. However, despite keeping the OCF reduced due to this clutter in the operating accounts, Jack still managed to maintain a record investment of $98.8 million in Capex and maintain a positive free cash flow. Note that despite these problems, Jack managed to maintain its free cash flow on invested capital at levels similar to Wendy's. If we normalized its free cash flow to non-anomalous levels we would have a free cash flow of approximately 6%, which is not bad at all. Also note the difference between ROA and ROCE. This is precisely due to the comparison method and the exclusion of interest paid on third-party capital and taxes on the latter. In conjunction with the high burden of implicit costs on third-party capital, Jack also has many sources of operational financing in current liabilities, which reduces the need for financial liabilities to fund immobilization and also reduces the capital employed. To give you an idea, when we exclude the effects of interest and taxes, Jack shows an EBIT margin of 15.14%, which is more than 90% higher than the industry median. This brings us to the need to take a look at Jack's financing structure:   Author Note that even by industry standards, Jack finds itself with very high levels of debt. Despite the reduction in leverage since 2019 (where the company reached a debt ratio of 176%), the company only reduced just under 5% of its long-term debt over the course of two years, which still continues to put pressure on its operating profit . Remember, despite this, the company does not incur short-term debt to maintain its investments in operational assets, but uses operational liabilities, mainly those not related to the cash conversion cycle, but which help the company to not have to incur ""addictive"" short-term loans. In any case, depending on short-term loans or not, I consider Jack's debt levels to be quite high. Despite not incurring a massive economic risk due to the satisfactory generation of EBIT, the company incurs massive financial risk due to leverage. Still on debt, I would also like to make some brief considerations about the imminence of financial risk and the possibility of economic risk based on coverage data. Firstly, I was able to identify a deterioration in the Debt Efficiency index (Return on Debt/Cost of Debt). The index in 2017 was 5.6, falling to 2.7 during the pandemic and maintaining a range between 2.8 and 4.0 until then. Both the return on debt and the Debt Efficiency are at levels below their 10-year average. Other indicators that I modeled were related to debt coverage from Cash Flow. As you already know, Jack's Cash Flow has been suffering for some time due to an increase in operational accounts, mainly at the end of 2023 and beginning of 2024. We have already talked about this. But what we haven't talked about yet is how this affects debt coverage. With Cash Flow stagnant and debt rising (at least until 2019) we noticed a deterioration in principal coverage using OCF. Over the last ten years, Jack maintained an average principal coverage ratio with an OCF of 7.71. This meant that Jack generally needed a little more than 7x its OCF for the corresponding year to cover its debt principal. Jack currently maintains an index of 14.9. For those interested in more heterodox data, debt interest coverage from the OCF through the debt service coverage indicator adjusted for cash flow variability also deteriorated, falling from 2.79 in 2019 to 1.94. To have a basis for comparison, the average coverage of indebted companies like Bloomin' Brands is 8.09. In the case of Debt Efficiency, despite seeing a drop in pre-pandemic standards, Jack still outperforms direct competitors such as Wendy's, which has maintained an index of 2.17 in the last five years, while Jack has an index of 3.14 in the same period. Therefore, we can say that even though it is very indebted and needs to restructure its financing sources, Jack is still able to maintain solvency rates in line with companies (despite being very indebted) that are less indebted than itself. My thesis In my opinion, Jack has everything a limited-service restaurant needs to navigate an environment that suffers exogenous pressures (due to substitute products and increases in labor costs) and endogenous pressures (promotional environments and industry-level margin compression). This implies that the company is actively positioning itself so that its capabilities integrate new industry paradigms. Promotions with appeal, use of barbell pricing in menu engineering, premium items with a satisfactory gross cash inflow, successful launches (see the case of Smashed Jack Burger and all the buzz on social media) make me see that both prices and The products are aligned with industry paradigms. Broader strategies such as the integration of a modern POS that allows the use of all the benefits provided by AI are also almost mandatory today. Although in this sense Jack is not at the same level as its peers, the recent integration with Qu seems to me that there will be developments in this regard. Therefore, the coming quarters should see an increase in digital sales as the company completes this integration. Other needs that I also see as mandatory are the optimization of the park at times with lower traffic and the development of lean units being developed within Jack. The 'CRAVED' unit appears to have a very satisfactory payback and will be able to lead the international expansion project. In this sense, I see the success of the units in Mexico and the interest of new operators as something very interesting and should also be observed closely. Another very interesting point is the refranchising of company-owned units. This is helping and will likely continue to help Jack deal with rising labor costs in the long term. Furthermore, the aspects that concern me at the moment refer to the structural aspects of the company. We saw a dilapidation in solvency ratios, corroborated by a weaker operating cash flow and a persistently large long-term debt that appears to be out of step with the EBIT, which continues to grow slowly, typical of mature companies. However, Jack maintains a negative net need for working capital, managing to finance its working capital from operational liabilities. This implies that even with the increase in operating assets that we have recently seen cluttering up the cash flow, Jack does not appear to have a need to increase financing and increase its total debts. In my opinion, these structural factors are resolved when we compare them with other indebted companies (as I have done previously) and look at their undervaluation. Therefore, even with these headwinds, I still see potential in Jack within the current environment, as the company is adapting to the vast majority of needs that a modern QSR must seek. At current price levels I would recommend 'Buy' for Jack. I believe that all the problems we discussed previously have already been priced in. The company is taking extensive measures both to maintain margins and to attract lost traffic by presenting a very interesting promotional mix.  Valuation I would like to start our valuation procedure today not with the 'Comps', but with the NPVGO Model. To accomplish this, we need to calculate both the value of your current operations and the value of future growth opportunities. We consider EPS for fiscal 2024 to be in line with analyst estimates of $6.32. For the discount rate I used 7.97%. The payout rate for Jack is approximately 29%, naturally the retention rate will be 71%. Thus, the retention per share is $4.49, which will generate growth from retention of just $0.28 in the first year of retention, $0.29 in the second and $0.31 in the third. As the retention-based investment serves as the initial cost of investment projects each year, we have a negative NPV all these years, which when we bring it to present value with the help of the discount rate we have the following values √¢¬Ä¬ã√¢¬Ä¬ãfor the next three years : -$0.89, -$0.86 and -$0.83. But you may even wonder: why do managers choose projects with negative NPVs? Wouldn't it be easier to distribute a higher percentage of the profit. The issue is not that simple. Stephen Ross, a leading professor of corporate finance conjectures that managers like to control large companies and retain profits rather than pay dividends and thus increase the size of the firm. Anyway, when we calculate the perpetual value of NPVGO it is -$27.31. We need to add this to the value of the firm as if it were a 'cash cow', using the EPS to calculate the simple perpetual value, which is $79.30. This means the enterprise value + NPVGO is $51.99. This is approximately 5.3% above the current share price. Let's see how this happens in the 'Comps Model'? I selected five companies to compare with Jack. The result is in the following table: Author Note that to arrive at the value of $89.28 I excluded from the average both Price/Sales and EV/Sales which were inflating our target price using the Comps model. Remembering that I used both Equity ratios and Enterprise ratios, the latter being multiples that consider the capital structure. Note that even considering the capital structure, both EV/EBIT and EV/EBITDA present prices higher than the current value of the share. Now we can look at the discounted cash flow models. First let's start with dividends. We already know that because the payout is low (less than 30%), the expected dividend (D1) will be lower and, consequently, our target price will be lower. To resolve this fact, I will use the Single Period DDM and the Multi Period DDM, this way we will avoid considerations regarding the growth of these dividends. The result is what you see in the table below:   Author Now let's model the DCF. For WACC we will consider 6.73%. The following image is the FCFF forecast for the coming years:   Author Note that the DCF model also indicates that the share is being traded below its intrinsic value, more or less in line with the value we found in NPVGO. However, in this case, the price based on the DCF points to an upside of approximately 6.5%. We can still use the Graham Model and the Lynch Model to obtain some other perspectives that corroborate the undervaluation hypothesis. For growth in the Graham Model I used the internal growth rate (which we use in the NPVGO Model). For the Lynch Model, I used the estimated EPS growth rate for the next fiscal year. Remembering that as the Lynch Model does not indicate a target price, but rather a state of relative valuation, it will not be included in our 'football field' graph and consequently in the analyst's definitive target price.   Author Now that we have a series of results from different valuation models, let's combine this data to find a target price that takes into account all the assumptions we made: 'Football field' target price (Author) Conclusion I would like to conclude by saying that although I believe in Jack's resilience in the current environment, some factors would make me consider lowering my rating for the company. The first of these is performance. Basically, aggressive adaptation strategies require more timely results to be justified. This is even more true when taking into account that QSRs compete directly with convenience stores, which puts them in a more dangerous place in terms of pricing than casual dining, for example.  Another factor that I consider extremely important is the level of debt. I will be monitoring the solvency ratios and as soon as they exceed the standards of highly indebted companies like Wendy's or Bloomin', I will give my opinion on the matter. For now I don't see any great danger, just precaution.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

After building support in the $40s since 2021, the uptrend that began last Nov. 2023 is unlikely to end. Helped by strong quarterly results, that sets up a rally to over $65, a price not seen since Jan. 22, 2018.√¢¬Ä¬ù In addition to the banks, Delta (DAL) and Pepsi (PEP) weigh in on Thursday. Delta continues to benefit from a premium consumer mix as a best-in-class operator, with diversified revenue and cash streams. Analysts are looking for Delta to reiterate its 2024 guidance for EPS of $6.00 to $7.00 and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. Options trading implies a share price swing of 6% after the report. Pepsi√¢¬Ä¬ôs organic sales are seen rising by 3%, led by a strong performance in the Europe and Latin America regions. Volume is seen up 4.1% to offset a 1.1% decline in pricing. UBS says that although the stock has largely traded sideways to start the year, the firm's crowding analysis points to the stock being a crowded long and conversations would suggest sentiment remains negative heading into results due to concerns about challenging U.S. trends. Other earnings this week include Greenbrier (GBX) on Monday. Helen of Troy (HELE) and Kura Sushi (KRUS) report Tuesday. Manchester United (MANU) √¢¬Ä¬ì full of executives and short on players so far -- and PriceSmart (PSMT) weigh in on Wednesday. Conagra Brands (CAG) joins Pepsi and Delta on Thursday, which is also inflation day. The June consumer price index is expected to have risen 0.1% on the month, bringing the annual rate down to 3.1%. The core CPI is forecast for a 0.2% rise. Morgan Stanley says both the CPI and the PCE have confirmed solid economic growth of 2%, which ""amounts to a pretty comfortable soft landing. ""While markets may be wringing their hands over a slowdown, from the Fed√¢¬Ä¬ôs perspective it would be most welcome,"" chief global economist Seth Carpenter said. ""In fact, a slowdown at least as big as we expect is probably seen as necessary within the Fed to achieve its goal of extending the current cycle while bringing inflation down."" ""After a lull in the (1990s) economy and a very shallow reversal from the Fed, the economy continued to grow for the rest of the decade. Currently, the market is pricing in cuts, and we actually expect a bit more than is priced, but like the 1990s, we think the cutting cycle will be shallow. Investors hoping for a √¢¬Ä¬úlate cycle√¢¬Ä¬ù scenario that turns to a rebound where rates are slashed by several hundred basis points may be in for some disappointment."" In the news this weekend, casino operators on the Las Vegas Strip have a near-term earnings catalyst on the horizon, with the closing of the Tropicana Las Vegas and The Mirage Hotel & Casino representing a 4.9% combined reduction in total room supply on the Las Vegas Strip. The AP notes that when the Tropicana opened in 1957 it was the most expensive and lavish casino on the Strip. Nicknamed the √¢¬Ä¬úTiffany of the Strip√¢¬Ä¬ù it cost $15 million to build, with 300 rooms split into two wings, creating a footprint shaped like the letter √¢¬Ä¬úY.√¢¬Ä¬ù Behind the scenes, it had ties to mobster Frank Costello and has been a pop culture staple. It served as the location of Moe Green's hotel in √¢¬Ä¬úThe Godfather√¢¬Ä¬ù and in √¢¬Ä¬úDiamonds Are Forever,√¢¬Ä¬ù James Bond says √¢¬Ä¬úI hear that the Hotel Tropicana's quite comfortable.√¢¬Ä¬ù CBRE Equity Research analysts said the Mirage is the more meaningful contraction. ""We estimate that The Mirage had ~1mm occupied room nights and generated $596M of revenue and $169M of EBITDAR in FY23. This represents significant underlying demand for the Las Vegas Strip that will need to find a home."" Looking to the markets, stocks are coming off their best week since April, with heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) snapping a two-week losing streak. Seeking Alpha's Rena Sherbill spoke to Jonah Lupton, who runs the Fundamental Growth Investor Investing Group. ""I don't even know what to make of NVIDIA. I mean, I don't think we know what the next three, four, five years is going to look like for artificial intelligence. We don't know their specific roadmap. We don't know what competitors might be coming down the pipeline with their own chips. I mean, we've all heard stories about the hyperscalers like Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), they're going to want to build their own chips, okay, it sounds good. I don't know if they'll actually be able to do it. And then how will those chips compare to whatever the newest, greatest NVIDIA chip is? And if they're building their own chips, are they going to save enough money by using an inferior chip to justify not using the best NVIDIA chip? Like, I don't know. I mean, China, ByteDance (BDNCE) is apparently trying to develop their own chips now. I just -- it's wild. I just don't think, I think if you believe in artificial intelligence, I just think this is the one stock that you have to own and you can't try to trade in and out of it because it's going to do things like this, down 6% one day, up 8% the next day. Thank God, I started buying it a year ago when it gapped up on that earnings report. Even though I didn't fully understand the importance of H100s and where that would lead us. But now, I mean, you listen to these earnings calls from all the hyperscalers and all they talk about is trying to get their hands on as many H100s as possible, or H200s and the new BGs that are coming out. I mean, Tesla (TSLA) is getting ready to build a supercomputer with Dell (DELL) and Super Micro with tens of thousands of H100s. Like - it's like an arms race, which company can buy the most H100s. And then I don't even know what's going to happen in two or three years. Let's just say Meta (META) has 10,000 H100s. At what point do they have to upgrade? And then what do they do with the H100? Do they sell them off for $0.50 on the $1 or do they keep them and go buy whatever the new chip is? I don't know. It's going to be very interesting to play out. I just think if you believe in artificial intelligence and LLMs, and I just think NVIDIA is still the best way to play it."" And in the Wall Street Research Corner, Wells Fargo says the boom in AI sets up companies focused on natural gas as trend winners. Midstream energy companies focused on natural gas should be visible long-term beneficiaries from the build out of data-center capacity in the U.S. to run AI operations, analyst Ian Mikkelsen said. About 43% of electricity is generated from natural gas and the build-out of energy-hungry data centers is in very early stages. √¢¬Ä¬úWe believe that U.S. natural gas production capacity and reserves are sufficient to meet growing demand, with infrastructure being the key constraint in balancing supply with this demand growth over time,√¢¬Ä¬ù he said. √¢¬Ä¬úWe expect this to provide midstream companies with incremental growth opportunities and higher utilization of existing assets, ultimately extending the terminal value of natural gas infrastructure.√¢¬Ä¬ù",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fred Warner is the consensus best LB in the NFL and Dre Greenlaw‚Äôs ascension into the upper tier at the position has allowed San Francisco to control the middle of the field as well as any team in the league.2024 comes with a new set of challenges though as the club looks to integrate some new depth and replace Greenlaw who is recovering from a torn Achilles he suffered in the Super Bowl. We‚Äôll learn plenty about how things shake out with that group in training camp, and these are the questions we‚Äôll be looking to have answered:1. Can De‚ÄôVondre Campbell still play?Campbell was an All-Pro just three seasons ago. Since then his overall production has dipped, but it could be a product of the personnel or scheme in Green Bay. He‚Äôs an undeniably talented veteran who should be able to fill in for Greenlaw even if it is past time for Campbell to be that level of player. Playing next to Warner should elevate the 31-year-old. How much it elevates his play is something we‚Äôll be intrigued to see in camp.2. Will Dre Greenlaw participate at all?It sounds like Greenlaw is destined for the PUP list which would hold him out of camp and the first few weeks of the regular season. General manager John Lynch said Greenlaw wants to return by Week 1, although the GM did indicate that timeline was probably too ambitious. If Greenlaw participates in any camp though it would be a good sign that he‚Äôs tracking toward returning early in the year. If he spends all of camp on PUP, which is the most likely scenario, we can expect a mid-to-late season return if he‚Äôs able to suit up in 2024 at all.3. Who‚Äôs the third LB?While the Greenlaw saga plays out we‚Äôll also need to keep an eye on which player steps in as the Sam LB in base packages. Last year the role belonged to Oren Burks who jumped up to the WLB spot when Greenlaw went down. The SLB isn‚Äôt on the field very often given how often defenses run in sub packages against modern offenses, but the winner of that job would likely be the first player up in the event that one of Campbell or Warner are unavailable. There‚Äôs a relative lack of experience behind the two starters, which makes SLB a pretty significant question mark and position battle in camp.4. How are the 2023 picks coming along?This one piggybacks off the third LB conversation. San Francisco selected LBs Dee Winters and Jalen Graham late on Day 3 in last year‚Äôs draft. Neither player contributed defensively as rookies, but there‚Äôs reason for optimism about both given the 49ers‚Äô penchant for finding quality LB talent. This is a wide open door for both to step into a starting role as the third LB. If either of them takes that job this season it bodes well for their future as a contributor for San Francisco‚Äôs defense. Watching their progress should be a fun aspect of camp this year.

CHK3jd71VOsNHR4,Seeking Alpha,bing,Uber Technologies: Confusing Profit Trajectory Is Offsetting Growth Prospects,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702806-uber-technologies-stock-confusing-profit-trajectory-offsets-growth-prospects,2024-07-07 18:11,2024-07-07 18:22,UBER,,"MOZCO Mateusz Szymanski Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is the poster child of the 'Efficiency' trend that started in 2022. Holding the unquestionable achievement of being one of the highest cash-burning companies in history, Uber was able to flip the switch and focus on profits.  After three consecutive quarters of margin improvements and relatively 'clean' numbers, Uber's operating margins once again regressed in Q1.  Let's dive into Uber's growth prospects and assess its profit trajectory going forward. Introduction To Uber Technologies Uber was founded in 2009 by Garret Camp and Travis Kalanick as a global ridesharing platform. In 2014, the company entered the food delivery market under the Uber Eats brand, and in 2017, it entered the freight market. At its core, Uber is a technology company that specializes in marketplace platforms. Its Mobility segment facilitates connections between drivers and riders. Its Delivery segment connects sellers (restaurants, liquor stores, grocers, retailers), deliverymen, and end customers. Lastly, the Freight segment connects shippers and carriers. Uber faced significant challenges over the years, including a controversy with one of the founders, regulatory pressures, intense competition, and an astounding cash burn. Some of these challenges are still ongoing and are an integral part of the company's reality. Data by YCharts Uber's IPO took place in 2019, and we can see that the stock significantly underperformed the indices since. However, it's a completely different story since mid-2022.  Uber's Profitability Transformation  We all know what happened to unprofitable growth companies in the fallout of 2022, and Uber was no exception. From its peak in April 2021 to the July 2022 lows, Uber's shares slid by 65%.  Then, finally, investors started recognizing a true shift in focus, and a real path to positive free cash flows.   Uber 2024 Investor Update While Uber's gross margins have remained relatively stable since 2022, the company demonstrated immense operational leverage on its overhead. As a percentage of sales, Operation & Support dropped from 8.4% in Q1'22 to 6.8% in Q1'24; Sales & Marketing dropped from 18.4% to 9.0%; Research & Development dropped from 8.6% to 7.8%, and; Depreciation & Amortization dropped from 3.7% to 1.9%. Overall, Operating margins improved from a negative 7.0% to a positive 4.7% if we adjust legal costs.   Created and calculated by the author using data from Uber financial reports. Growth was never a problem for Uber, showcasing an astounding 30% CAGR in revenues between 2017-2023. During this period, monthly active customers grew from 68 million to 150 million, and total gross bookings rose more than 4x to $138 billion. The combination of exceptional revenue growth and improving profitability will almost always yield great returns, as was the case here: Data by YCharts Uber shares more than tripled since their 2022 bottom, with the surge culminating after the recent investor day. However, as we can see, shares have dropped pretty quickly from their peak, and are now trading 13% below all-time highs.  Let's dive into why. Profitability Hurdles Overshadow Elevated Growth In Q1 On their investor day, Uber's management committed to ambitious profitable growth goals, targeting gross bookings growth in the mid-to-high teens, adj. EBITDA growth in the high 30% to 40%, and free cash flow conversion of 90% and higher:   Uber 2024 Investor Update I think that investors were justifiably enthusiastic about this outlook. However, I also think that they are right in taking caution following the recent first-quarter results, as they realized Uber is still relying on adjusted metrics as their north star. It's one thing to use adjusted EBITDA when you're a young company seeking growth at all costs. It's another thing to use it at this stage in Uber's path, as it's closing in on nearly $45 billion in revenues this year. We saw that materializing in Q1, as Uber reported $1.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, but only $170 million in operating profit, or $475 million excluding one-offs.  No matter how much acrobatics analysts or companies will do, GAAP metrics, both P&L and the cash statement, will always be the safest and most reliable way to evaluate mature companies. On that front, the first quarter was a little disappointing. Tesla's Robotaxi Setting aside the profitability hurdles, there are two other forces that are currently dragging down the stock, in my view. The first is expectations Tesla (TSLA) will launch its robotaxi in its August event. It's unclear when the robotaxi will become commercial, how, and through which platform. Still, some investors believe it poses a risk to Uber. I am personally reluctant to base my investment decisions on such low-probability scenarios, but even small uncertainty could cause a stock to go down.  I don't think the difference in performance between the two stocks is entirely a coincidence: Data by YCharts Market Share Losses & Competitive Advantages The second cause for concern is recent market share losses to DoorDash (DASH) and Lyft (LYFT). Uber is by far the largest player if you look at the Mobility and Delivery markets as one. Having both lines of business in-house is a huge competitive advantage, as Uber leverages its tech stack and advertising offering on both platforms. It also allows Uber to offer differentiated services like Uber One, it enables cross-selling to users, and it also helps in recruiting drivers.  Still, there's immense competition in every geography and every line of business.   Created and calculated by the author using data from Uber, DoorDash and Lyft reports. There are plenty of ways to measure Uber's market share, but I like to create my own data sets. In the above graph, you can see each company's share as a percentage of combined delivery and mobility revenues. As shown, Uber lost 1% to DoorDash in Q1-24, while Lyft maintained its share. If we dive a little deeper, Uber lost a 1.4% share of revenues to DoorDash in Delivery revenue, and 1.2% in bookings. In Mobility, Uber lost 0.4% revenue share to Lyft and 0.3% bookings share. So, although Uber maintains its dominant position, and remains the overwhelming leader in each line of business, it is showing signs of weakness. Valuation Is Too High So, at this point, I wanted to establish the following - Uber is a clear leader in several fast-growing categories, and its growth prospects are exceptional. However, the stock is weighed down by increasing competitive pressures, profitability questions, and worries about robotaxi disruption. In addition, there's the usual regulatory burden in the background. With all that said, Uber is a high-teens growth company for the foreseeable future, and investors will make money in it if they buy at a valuation that reflects all the tensions we discussed.  Because of the company's equity holdings, its earnings are very noisy and cannot be relied on for evaluation. Therefore, we'll rely on EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. The difference between FCF and EBITDA to the adjusted metrics is solely stock-based comp. which I held steady at $2 billion in my projections.    Created and calculated by the author based on consensus estimates and Uber's guidance. At the current share price, Uber is trading a 49 times forward free cash flow, and 42 times EBITDA. Those multiples are just too high. Conclusion Uber is going back down to earth after the stock more than tripled from its 2022 bottom, as the company executed a very impressive profitability transformation. In recent months, the next leg up in terms of profitability has become tougher to foresee as competition is increasing. That, along with the usual regulatory pressures and robotaxi uncertainty, all contributed to a period of underperformance. Still, Uber is trading at a very high valuation. While the company's leadership and mid-teens growth trajectory are unquestionable in my view, I don't see how the stock outperforms from these levels.  Therefore, I rate Uber a Hold.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

See NASCAR's Latest Prototype In Action.,https://insideevs.com/news/725761/nascar-electric-chevrolet-ford-toyota/,2024-07-07 19:07,2024-07-07 19:13,TSLA,,"NASCAR and electrification company ABB have joined forces with Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota to develop an impressive new electric performance car. Their goal is not only to demonstrate the excitement and power that electric racing can bring to the table. They also want to gauge fan interest in this new category of high-performance electric vehicles. The vehicle was demoed this morning as part of the NASCAR Cup Series with veteran driver David Ragan behind the wheel at the Chicago Street Race. Many fans and media figures captured footage of the exciting new car in action including @MrGoElectric on X. ¬† Ragan told the Associated Press that it was ‚Äúreally wild‚Äù being able to hear the squeal of the tires and smell the brakes around the curb. This new electric stock car is certainly quieter than most NASCAR fans are used to, although it is far from silent. While it doesn‚Äôt produce the deep rumble of a car‚Äôs combustion engine, the satisfying electronic hum sounds plenty powerful as it whips by the crowd.  This electric stock car certainly has the power to compete with three STARD UHP 6-Phase motors powered by a 78 kWh battery that produces 1,000 kW at peak power. Acceleration is twice as quick as your typical stock car and the combined regen and friction braking outperforms its combustion engine cousins.

The vehicle‚Äôs lap time in a recent test at Martinsville Speedway was two-tenths of a second slower than other vehicles in attendance. But Ragan admitted he was not pushing the brand new, one-of-a-kind vehicle to the limit in a testing situation like this. If none of this excites you, don‚Äôt worry. No one expects electric vehicles to dominate traditional NASCAR competitions anytime soon. There would likely be a specific racing series for this category of vehicles. This is just one dimension of NASCAR‚Äôs plan to clean up its events overall, cutting operating emissions to ‚Äúnet zero‚Äù by 2035. ¬† Electric vehicles are already impressive showings at other racing events such as Pikes Peak or N√ºrburgring. The EVs have combustion vehicles beat in raw power, but it remains to be seen whether they have the endurance to compete in events distances of 400 or 500 miles.

Tesla (TSLA) remains in the spotlight after a 27% surge in the EV maker‚Äôs share price last week drove the stock back into the green for the year. The rally followed a better-than-expected second-quarter deliveries report on Tuesday and building anticipation ahead of the company's Robotaxi Day¬†next month. Amid the strong recent price momentum, we use technical analysis to identify key areas on Tesla‚Äôs weekly chart to watch out for.  ¬†Breakout Above Key Chart Indicators   Tesla shares have been tracking higher since the completion of a piercing pattern in late April. Typically, technical analysts interpret this two-bar candlestick formation as signaling a potential reversal from a downward trend to an upward trend. Last week, the stock closed above both the 50- and 200-week moving averages and a prominent 12-month downtrend line on the highest trading volume since mid-February, indicating buying conviction among market participants. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) nears overbought territory, confirming the strong recent price momentum.  Levels to Watch Amid Further Upside   If the stock continues to climb higher, investors should focus on three key chart levels. Firstly, it‚Äôs worth watching how the price responds to last year‚Äôs high at $299.29, an area that also sits in close proximity to two prior price peaks that formed in August and September 2022. A close above this region could see Tesla shares move up to the next important resistance level at $384.29, where they may encounter selling pressure near the April 2022 swing high. Interestingly, this area also roughly aligns with a bars pattern of the stock‚Äôs January to July 2023 uptrend applied to the April swing low. Upon a breakout above this level, the stock could make an attempt at setting a new all-time high (ATH) above its current record high at $414.50 minted in November 2021.  Monitor This Key Area During Retracements   Given the stock trades near overbought conditions, it‚Äôs also worth identifying where it may find support during a pullback. A retracement would likely find buying interest around $205, an area on the chart where a horizontal line connects a series of peaks and troughs dating back to February last year. This trendline also forms the neckline of an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

xY4s2g1aTiUhowI,Seeking Alpha,google,DoorDash: Stellar Performance Does Not A 'Buy' Make (NASDAQ:DASH),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702818-doordash-stellar-performance-does-not-a-buy-make,2024-07-07 22:48,2024-07-07 22:56,UBER,,"Kenneth CheungThere is a very high probability that you have heard of a company by the name of DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH). In case you haven't, the firm operates a platform that allows its users to order, for quick delivery, food from restaurants, as well as goods from convenience stores, retail establishments, and more. Over the past few years, the business has really grown at a rapid pace. As impressive as its top line expansion has been, its bottom line improvement has been even more remarkable. To be clear, the company still has some issues it needs to sort through. But I have no doubt that the future for the enterprise looks promising. Usually, when you buy into a fast-growing company, you are expected to pay a premium for that growth. The expectation is that growth will be strong enough to eventually justify the valuation, plus any upside that you might want. In some cases, this turns out quite well. But in others, it can be painful. As an example, consider from the time I last wrote about the company, back in December of 2020. Even though shares were expensive, I felt as though some upside for investors would be warranted in the long run. That led me to rate it a √¢¬Ä¬òbuy.√¢¬Ä¬ô Unfortunately, this was one of the few instances that I was dead wrong about. Since then, shares are down 36.6%. This compares to the 49.3% increase seen by the S&P 500 over the same window of time. The company's overall financial condition is undoubtedly significantly better since then. But between my own evolution as an investor, with a focus more on value and less on growth, I have to re-evaluate the situation. Even though I believe the company will do well for itself in the long run, shares still look very pricey. It is possible that the picture could change for the better in a fairly short window of time. But I think it is premature to expect that to happen enough to justify upside from here. Because of this, I have decided to downgrade the stock to a √¢¬Ä¬òhold.√¢¬Ä¬ô Rapid growth Author - SEC EDGAR Data Over the past few years, DoorDash has seen some really impressive growth. Revenue for the company jumped from $4.89 billion back in 2021 to $8.64 billion in 2023. That's an annualized increase of 32.9%. There are a couple of indicators that discuss why this expansion took place. For starters, the number of orders placed on the platform exploded higher, rising from 1.39 billion to 2.16 billion. That's 55.5% growth in the span of two years. As a result, Marketplace GOV, or gross order value, jumped from $41.94 billion to $66.77 billion. For clarity's sake, the company defines marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on the company's platform. This is inclusive of taxes, consumer fees, membership fees, and more. Author - SEC EDGAR Data Management has not been terribly clear when it comes to the number of subscribers to its premium services. These include not only its DashPass users, but also its Wolt+ users. Wolt, for context, is its Finland-based online food delivery service. Unfortunately, data for 2021 is not available. But we do know that from 2022 to 2023, the number of premium subscribers expanded from 15 million to 18 million. On the bottom line, the picture has been mixed but has generally shown signs of improvement. The firm went from a net loss of $468 million in 2021 to a loss of $1.37 billion in 2022. That loss narrowed, fortunately, to only $558 million in 2023. Other profitability metrics have shown a similar trajectory. Operating cash flow, for instance, dropped from $692 million in 2021 to $367 million the year after. But in 2023, it ballooned to $1.67 billion. If we adjust for changes in working capital, we get an eventual rise from $301 million to $1.26 billion. And over the same window of time, EBITDA for the company expanded from $289 million to $1.19 billion. Author - SEC EDGAR Data Growth for the company has continued into the 2024 fiscal year. At present, we only have data for the first quarter. But for that time, revenue for the company came in at $2.51 billion. That happens to be 23.5% above the $2.04 billion generated the same time one year earlier. An increase in the number of orders from 512 million to 620 million, as well as a rise in Marketplace GOV from $15.91 billion to $19.24 billion, was instrumental in pushing this higher. Naturally, the company's bottom line has continued to improve. The firm's net loss narrowed from $161 million to $23 million. Operating cash flow nearly doubled from $397 million to $553 million. On an adjusted basis, it also nearly doubled, jumping from $227 million to $409 million. And lastly, we have EBITDA. It managed to jump from $204 million to $371 million. Clearly, the picture for the company is improving at a rather drastic base. And that is absolutely encouraging from the perspective of investors. This has been the hope for all growth businesses. As firms scale, they are able to eventually cut down on costs and exercise pricing power over their markets. When this occurs, there is the potential for not only continued attractive growth, but also for expansion on the bottom line. Author - SEC EDGAR Data This doesn't necessarily mean that the company makes sense to buy into at this point in time. As great as the picture has been from a fundamental perspective, shares are quite pricey. In the chart above, you can see how shares are priced using data from 2022 and 2023. This chart also looks at a forward estimate for 2024. You see, for the second quarter of this year, management has forecasted EBITDA of between $325 million and $375 million. At the midpoint, this would be about 34.4% above what was seen the same time last year. If we assume that the third and fourth quarters of this year will grow at the same rate, year over year, as what is expected for the second quarter, this would imply adjusted operating cash flow this year of $1.79 billion and EBITDA of $1.70 billion. Even in this case, shares are looking a bit lofty. Even though I have decided to keep the company rated a √¢¬Ä¬òhold,√¢¬Ä¬ô this does not mean that I don't believe in its potential for further growth. When focused on just the US market alone, the online food delivery space was valued at about $210.6 billion in 2022. That is expected to grow to $556.1 billion by 2030, for an annualized growth rate of 11.8%. That's a solid amount of growth, for sure. Obviously, there are international opportunities for the business as well. And management has been making moves on that front. Back in 2021, only $11 million of the company's revenue came from international sales. By 2023, international revenue accounted for $854 million of the company's top line. However, that still means that 90.1% of the firm's sales come from its domestic market. So our emphasis should certainly be on that space. Another thing to keep in mind is that competition in this industry is fierce. Domestically, the other big player that√¢¬Ä¬ôs publicly traded to be aware of is Uber Technologies (UBER). That company puts all of its delivery related activities under its Delivery segment. Fortunately, overall growth from a revenue perspective has been quite modest. In the first quarter of 2024, for instance, Uber Technologies√¢¬Ä¬ô Delivery business generated revenue of only $3.21 billion. That happened to be only 3.9% above the $3.09 billion reported one year earlier. However, profitability for that segment has shot up, with EBITDA skyrocketing from $288 million in the first quarter of 2023 to $528 million the same time of 2024. Uber Technologies Management at Uber Technologies has also been investing pretty heavily in this space. In May of this year, the company acquired the foodpanda delivery business that was then owned by Delivery Hero SE. This is essentially Delivery Hero√¢¬Ä¬ôs food delivery operation in Taiwan. The purchase price agreed upon was $950 million. In addition to this, Uber Technologies Agreed to make a $300 million investment directly into Delivery Hero SE. Earlier in May, Uber Technologies also announced that it was partnering up with Instacart (CART). That partnership will allow Instacart customers to order from hundreds of restaurants through the Instacart app, in addition to the roughly 1,500 national, regional, and local retail banners that they can order from that represent 85,000 stores. This will come at no additional cost when grocery and/or restaurant orders are above $35 each. Takeaway  Operationally speaking, DoorDash is doing quite well. I would like to see the company finally turn and keep a profit. But it looks as though that's not too far off on the horizon. In the long run, I fully expect the firm to do well for itself and its investors. But this does not make it an ideal opportunity. Despite attractive growth, particularly on the bottom line, shares are still a bit pricey. In addition to this, it will have to fend off against serious competition, most notably from Uber Technologies. Given the competitiveness of this market and how shares are priced, I think it would only be appropriate to rate the company a √¢¬Ä¬òhold√¢¬Ä¬ô at this time.

ylqjkixqlcEsXge,BBC,rss,Boeing pleads guilty to a criminal fraud charge,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjjjj85z0lno,2024-07-08 00:15,2024-07-08 00:21,BA,,"Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge after the US found the company violated a deal meant to reform it after two fatal crashes by its 737 Max planes that killed 346 passengers and crew. The Department of Justice (DoJ) said the plane-maker had also agreed to pay a criminal fine of $243.6m (¬£190m). However, the families of the people who died on the flights five years ago have criticised it as a ""sweetheart deal"" that would allow Boeing to avoid full responsibility for the deaths. By pleading guilty, Boeing will avoid the spectacle of a criminal trial - something that victims' families have been pressing for. The company has been in crisis over its safety record since two near-identical crashes involving 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019. It led to the global grounding of the plane for more than a year. In 2021, prosecutors charged Boeing with one count of conspiracy to defraud regulators, alleging it had deceived the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about its MCAS flight control system, which was implicated in both crashes. It agreed not to prosecute Boeing if the company paid a penalty and successfully completed a three-year period of increased monitoring and reporting. But in January, shortly before that period was due to end, a door panel in a Boeing plane operated by Alaska Airlines blew out soon after take-off and forced the jet to land. No-one was injured during the incident but it intensified scrutiny over how much progress Boeing had made on improving its safety and quality record.    In May, the DoJ said it had found Boeing had violated the terms of the agreement, opening up the possibility of prosecution.  Boeing's decision to plead guilty is still a significant black mark for the firm because it means that the company - which is a prominent military contractor for the US government - now has a criminal record. It is also one of the world's two biggest manufacturers of commercial jets.  It is not immediately clear how the criminal record would affect the firm's contracting business. The government typically bars or suspends firms with records from participating in bids, but can grant waivers.  However, Paul Cassell, a lawyer representing some families of people killed on the 2018 and 2019 flights, said: ""The memory of 346 innocents killed by Boeing demands more justice than this."" In a letter to the government in June, he urged the DoJ to fine Boeing more than $24bn. Ed Pierson, executive director of Foundation for Aviation Safety and a former senior manager at Boeing, said the plea was ""seriously disappointing"" and ""a terrible deal for justice"". ""Instead of holding individuals accountable, they‚Äôre just basically giving them another get out of jail free card,‚Äù he said. A Boeing 737 Max plane operated by Indonesia's Lion Air crashed in late October 2018 shortly after take-off, killing all 189 people on board. Just months later, an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing all 157 passengers and crew. In the 2021 deal, Boeing also agreed to pay $2.5bn to resolve the matter, including a $243m criminal penalty and $500m to a victims' fund. The deal outraged family members, who were not consulted on the terms and have called for the company to stand trial. Senior staff at DoJ recommended in favour of prosecution, CBS News, the BBC's US news partner reported in late June.  At a hearing in June, Senator Richard Blumenthal said he believed that was ""near overwhelming evidence"" that prosecution should be pursued. Lawyers for family members said the DoJ was worried it did not have a strong case against the firm. Mark Forkner, a former Boeing technical pilot who was the only person to face criminal charges arising from the incident, was acquitted by a jury in 2022. His lawyers had argued he was being used as a scapegoat.  Mark Cohen, a professor emeritus at Vanderbilt University, who has studied corporate punishments, said prosecutors often prefer plea deals or deferred prosecution agreements, which allow them to avoid the risk of a trial and can give the government greater power over a company than a typical sentence.  ""Because it's easier to get than going to trial, it may ease the burden on the prosecutor but the prosecutor also may believe it's a better sanction [because] they may be able to impose requirements that aren't normally in sentencing guidelines,"" he said.  He said there was little doubt that Boeing's status as a key government contractor played a role in determining how to proceed.  ""They've got to think about the collateral consequences,"" he said. ""You don't take these kinds of cases lightly."" The issues with MCAS were not Boeing's first brush with the law.  It has also paid millions of penalties to the Federal Aviation Administration since 2015 to resolve a series of claims of improper manufacturing and other issues. The company also continues to face investigations and lawsuits sparked by the incident on the January Alaska Airlines flight.  Copyright 2024 BBC.

eTlAVfaZdIa1Vo1,Yahoo Finance,yahoo,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): The Best Stock to Buy According to Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-inc-tsla-best-stock-042424007.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall,2024-07-08 00:24,2024-07-08 00:32,TSLA,,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 New Stocks Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets Is Buying. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other WallStreetBets-approved stocks.The surge of the Internet and the easy access to financial information, courtesy of the personal computing revolution, means that investing is no longer limited to the professionals. While Wall Street of the 1950s and onward was made of traders relying on hand made graphs of daily stock price movements to decipher long term trends, now, anyone with a computer and an internet connection has access to similar and more sophisticated tools.This has also led to the rise of retail investing, which first made its mark during the coronavirus pandemic. Between 2020 and 2021, more than thirty million brokerage accounts were opened in the US, and the low interest rates coupled with coronavirus stimulus checks led to these traders accounting for 15% of the market's trading volume in September 2020. Data from investment bank Morgan Stanley shows that retail traders tend to prefer well known consumer facing stocks, and crucially, the bank's proprietary methodologies also show that in the five years between 2016 and 2021, stocks that garnered interest from retail investors ended up outperforming those without it.Building on this, the pandemic and the surge of information in today's age have also shifted the dynamics of how America views wealth preservation. A fresh survey from Gallup shows that while real estate continues to dominate as Americans' favorite investment regardless of their income bracket, stocks come in second place for middle and high income families. This preference for equities dropped after the Great Recession of 2008 which wiped out some of the biggest companies in the world after risky bets on mortgage securities shattered Wall Street's public image. According to Gallup's data, the percentage of Americans who own stocks is the highest in 2024 since 2007 - or before the global economic crisis. Stock ownership stood at 52% of those polled - an all time low - in 2013 and 2016.It slowly picked up and sat at 55% in 2020, and has risen every year since then to a post 2007 high of 62% in 2024. In fact, the last time stock ownership was higher than it is right now was in 2004 when 63% of Americans owned stocks during an era when interest rates were relatively low and the housing market was booming - economic conditions that are on a completely different spectrum than what we're experiencing right now.Story continuesBuilding on this, the divergence between retail investors and hedge funds came to the forefront of the investing world during the meme stock mania that saw the former pump up video game retailing and entertainment chain stocks as they rallied on social media and particularly Reddit's WallStreetBets, this trend continued in 2023. Data from S&P shows that in October when market sentiment about interest rates and the economy was at its lowest, retail investors sold off $15.64 billion in stocks for their largest monthly outflow since 2021. However, at the same time, the hedge funds appeared to smell blood. In a classic illustration of Warren Buffett's mantra of being greedy when others are fearful, the hedge funds bought $5.56 billion in stocks. Their three favorite sectors were real estate, utilities, and materials, with real estate and utilities witnessing the inflows after smart money flew out in the prior month. For some great Warren Buffett quotes, you can check out Warren Buffett‚Äôs 35 Best Quotes About Business, Investing, and Life.Judging by this, it appears that retail investors are driven by their economic perceptions instead of setting up their portfolios during a downturn. This is also evident in Charles Schwab's Trader Sentiment Survey released in February 2024. The bank's data reveals that 52% of retail traders planned to move more money into stocks during Q1 2024, which marks a 7 percentage point sequential gain. This also coincides with their view of the economy, as 48% think that the US will avoid a recession in 2024 and 53% are bullish for the stock market.With this context and as retail traders start to become bullish once again, we decided to take a look at how their previous bets have performed. The GameStop short squeeze of 2021 brought the Reddit subreddit WallStreetBets into the limelight and made Roaring Kitty a global celebrity. We covered some WallStreetBets stocks in 2021 and 2023, and in this piece, we'll analyze how the top 2021 stocks have performed since then. If you're interested in similar content, we also evaluated Cathie Wood's stock performance as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood.Our Methodology For our list of stocks, we took a look at our 2021 coverage of Forget AMC and Gamestop: 10 New Stocks Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets Is Buying and evaluated how these stocks have performed since June 2021. The stocks are re-ranked according to their share price percentage performance.For these stocks, we also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:TSLA)Share Price Performance Since July 2021 Start: 11.14% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 74Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the only WallStreetBets stock that is actually in the green since 2021. This is unsurprising, as, during this time, the firm has managed to prove its critics wrong and establish a dominant position in the global EV market through its robust production base. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) made 206,421 cars in Q2 2021 and doubled this figure to 433,371 cars in Q1 2024. During that time period, it set up two new factories - one in Germany and another in China. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also competing in the cutthroat Chinese electric vehicle market, and its heft coupled with a global production base allows it considerable advantages not only over Chinese companies in the Chinese market, but also globally since it can leverage its delivery and supply chains to gain an edge. Additionally, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) also benefits from a rather diversified business model that also focuses on energy storage. This business boomed during Q2 2024 when Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) deployed 9.4GWh of energy storage products which set a new record in its history. The stock gained 20% in the first five days of July on the back of this news, despite the holidays.Baron Funds mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:Tesla, Inc. designs, manufactures, and asells electric vehicles (EVs), related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Shares fell 29.3% in the first quarter as the core automotive segment is facing headwinds due to a complex macroeconomic environment, factory shutdowns, growing competitive risks in China, and vehicle price reductions which are pressuring gross margins. During the first quarter of 2024, production was also negatively impacted by the Red Sea maritime supply- chain interferences, sabotage in a Tesla factory‚Äôs power supply in Berlin, and a factory closure for the launch of the refreshed Model 3. We remain shareholders. Tesla commenced delivery of its highly anticipated Cybertruck pickup, which features new technologies within the car and its manufacturing lines. Tesla also launched version 12 of its Full Self Driving product, which shows significant progress from prior versions and increases the probability that Tesla‚Äôs data collection at scale, and verticalized software and hardware approach will position Tesla as a leader in the future for autonomous driving and shared mobility. We also expect energy storage sales to continue to grow over the coming years as the adoption of renewable energy continues. Lastly, we believe Tesla‚Äôs core automotive segment will recover with the company remaining a leader in the EV market, which continues to expand with EVs still accounting for only around 10% of vehicle sales globally.Overall TSLA ranks 1st¬†on our list of the WallStreetBets-approved stocks to buy. You can visit Forget AMC and Gamestop: 10 New Stocks Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets Is Buying to see the other WallStreetBets-approved stocks that are on hedge funds‚Äô radar. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

71vyRAWNntYT6Tj,The Motley Fool,google,Why SoundHound AI Stock Lost 22% Last Month,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/08/why-soundhound-ai-stock-lost-22-last-month/,2024-07-08 00:57,2024-07-08 01:02,NVDA,,"Shares of SoundHound AI (SOUN 6.62%) fell 21.8% in June 2024, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The voice control software specialist had no bad news to share last month, but investors shrugged off a handful of positive developments to drive the stock price lower anyway.The move still makes sense from a certain point of view. In my eyes, however, the price drop makes SoundHound AI a no-brainer buy right now.Nvidia's role in the spring's stock surgeThe June slide is a correction to an earlier jump. Semiconductor designer Nvidia (NVDA -1.91%) invested $3.7 million in SoundHound AI in 2023, building a 0.6% ownership stake in the smaller artificial intelligence (AI) company. When this investment was disclosed in February, Nvidia's modest position drove SoundHound AI's stock price sharply higher. The stock gained 66% overnight and tripled in price over the next two weeks. On March 15, one month after the disclosure, SoundHound AI's share price peaked at $10.25 -- more than four times the pre-disclosure level on $2.26 per share.Nvidia made several AI-oriented investments last year, and SoundHound AI was far from the largest one. The company also committed $147 million to Arm Holdings (ARM 7.70%) stock and $76 million to a Recursion Pharmaceuticals investment. Arm's muted market response to Nvidia's investment makes sense, since the company comes with a massive $190 billion market cap. But Recursion Pharma's jump was also smaller and more short-lived than SoundHound AI's, fading out entirely by the end of March.By then, Nvidia had shared some details about its intentions with the SoundHound AI investment. The two companies are working together on AI-driven voice control systems for the Nvidia Drive self-driving vehicle platform, and this small investment followed naturally from a tight operating partnership.So the investor enthusiasm about that Nvidia investment has been fading for months, and the June drop simply continued that trend.SoundHound AI's recent achievementsWhat about the positive developments I mentioned earlier? They weren't exactly game-changers, but one move accelerated SoundHound AI's ambitions in the restaurant management industry and the other two showed a sense of fiscal responsibility.The company paid off $100 million of long-term debt in June, leaving the balance sheet debt-free with $180 million in cash reserves. This payoff was financed by $143 million in new stock sales during the first quarter -- SoundHound AI took advantage of a soaring stock price.A small number of preferred stock stubs were converted into ordinary Class A shares. The company no longer needs to pay dividends to its preferred shareholders and the ownership structure is a little bit simpler with a single class of shares.Finally, SoundHound AI acquired food ordering specialist Allset Technologies for an undisclosed amount. The deal adds Allset's 7,000 customer locations to SoundHound AI's client roster, along with a small team of talented developers. ""This team-up will accelerate our progress toward the next exciting phase of AI-powered ordering convenience,"" Allset CEO Stas Matviyenko said.Wrapping up, SoundHound AI's recent stock slide is clearly more of a hiccup than a setback. The company's strategic vision, supported by a hefty $180 million cash reserve and an impressive $682 million backlog of unfilled orders and long-term subscriptions, positions it for significant growth.With such strong fundamentals and a forward-thinking management team, SoundHound AI stands out as an excellent investment opportunity right now. The lower share price only makes this idea more compelling.(RXRX -0.41%)",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gox exchange, which has begun returning a roughly $8 billion hoard of the largest digital asset.Most Read from BloombergBiden Narrows Gap With Trump in Swing States Despite Debate LossHedge Funds That Piled Into Big Tesla Short Stung by Huge RallyFrench Left Set for Shock Victory Over Macron and Le PenLe Pen Party Seeks Major French Election Win: What to WatchThe cryptocurrency slid as much as 5.2% on Monday before paring some of the wobble to trade at $55,290 as of 12:13 p.m. in Singapore, some $19,000 below March‚Äôs record high. Smaller tokens such as Ether and XRP sank too.Sentiment has also been hampered by signs of German government disposals of seized Bitcoin, while global markets as a whole are in a cautious mood as investors digest the results of weekend legislative elections in France.Once the world‚Äôs biggest Bitcoin exchange, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox was hacked in 2011 and went bankrupt in 2014. The long-awaited, staggered return of tokens to creditors spotlights a potential wall of supply coming into the market.The charts below analyze the outlook for Bitcoin following the token‚Äôs 25% retreat from its all-time peak in the first quarter.Technical TestSpeculators are scouring charts for patterns that may signal an end to Bitcoin‚Äôs tumble. Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG Australia Pty, flagged the 200-day moving average. A sustained rise above that mark would be an indication that Friday‚Äôs intraday low of about $53,600 was a ‚Äúcapitulation,‚Äù he wrote in note.Prolonged LossesBitcoin stumbled into Monday with an inauspicious slide. If the retreat lasts through Sunday, the token would post five straight weeks of declines, the longest such losing run since the 2022 digital-asset bear market. There‚Äôs a risk of a ‚Äúgrind lower‚Äù in prices until the Federal Reserve begins loosening monetary policy, said Stefan von Haenisch, head of trading at OSL SG Pte.Not So ExceptionalEarlier in 2024, Bitcoin‚Äôs year-to-date gain came close to 70%, far above traditional assets like stocks. Now the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is closer to overtaking the slumping token. Selloffs typically punctuate Bitcoin bull markets and the longer term outlook remains positive, said Khushboo Khullar, venture partner at Lightning Ventures, which invests in Bitcoin-linked companies.Spot-ETF FlowsSurprisingly strong demand for inaugural US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds stoked the digital asset‚Äôs record-breaking ascent earlier this year. The inflows have since moderated, and one question is whether the current weakness will spook ETF investors. But on Friday, at least, they appeared to buy the dip, registering the strongest net inflow in about a month.Story continuesThe Mt. Gox dispersal is unlikely to lead to mass selling by creditors but the longer Bitcoin spends below $60,000, the bigger the odds of a further price correction, said Hayden Hughes, head of crypto investments at family office Evergreen Growth in Singapore.Options WagersThe options market suggests some investors view the Bitcoin dip as temporary: the highest concentration of bullish wagers is around a strike price of $100,000, according to data from Deribit. This may reflect expectations of looser Fed monetary settings in coming months and the momentum behind pro-crypto Donald Trump‚Äôs bid to become US president again.Caroline Mauron, co-founder of digital-asset derivatives liquidity provider Orbit Markets, expects crypto to take its cue from global markets ahead of testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and US inflation data, which are due this week and may influence projections for monetary policy.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping PublishingOnline Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural AmericaThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever BeforeFor Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate¬©2024 Bloomberg L.P.View comments",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
OEQ3p4z3zv3wvFp,USA Today,google,Boeing to plead guilty to fraud in US probe of fatal 737 MAX crashes,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/07/08/boeing-justice-department-fraud-investigation-737-max-crashes/74323595007/,2024-07-08 01:26,2024-07-08 01:36,BA,,"Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation linked to two 737 MAX fatal crashes, the government said in a court filing late on Sunday.The plea, which requires a federal judge's approval, would brand the planemaker a convicted felon. Boeing will also pay a criminal fine of $243.6 million, the Justice Department (DOJ) said in a document filed in federal court in Texas that provided an overview of the agreement in principle.The charge relates to two 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia over a five-month period in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people and prompted the families of the victims to demand that Boeing face prosecution.A guilty plea potentially¬†threatens the company's ability¬†to secure lucrative government contracts with the likes of the U.S. Defense Department and NASA, although it could seek waivers. Boeing became exposed to criminal prosecution after the Justice Department in May found the company violated a 2021 settlement involving the fatal crashes.Still, the plea spares Boeing a contentious trial that could have exposed many of the company‚Äôs decisions leading up to the fatal MAX plane crashes to even greater public scrutiny. It would also make it easier for the company, which will have a new CEO later this year, as it seeks approval for its planned acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems.A Boeing spokesperson confirmed it had ""reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department.""The planemaker also agreed to invest at least $455 million over the next three years to strengthen its safety and compliance programs, according to the filing.The DOJ on June 30¬†offered a plea agreement to Boeing¬†and gave the company until the end of the week to take the deal or face a trial on a charge of conspiring to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in connection with a key software feature tied to the fatal crashes.The Justice Department's push to charge Boeing has deepened an ongoing crisis engulfing Boeing since a separate January in-flight blowout exposed continuing safety and quality issues at the planemaker.A panel blew off a new Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet during a Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines flight, just two days before the 2021 deferred prosecution agreement that had shielded the company from prosecution over the previous fatal crashes expired. Boeing faces a¬†separate ongoing criminal probe¬†into the Alaska incident.The agreement only covers Boeing's conduct before the fatal crashes and does not shield the planemaker from any other potential investigations or charges related to the January incident or other conduct.Boeing is set to plead guilty to making knowingly false representations to the Federal Aviation Administration about having expanded a key software feature used on the MAX to operate at low speeds. The new software saved Boeing money by requiring less intensive training for pilots.The Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) is a software feature designed to automatically push the airplane‚Äôs nose down in certain conditions. It was tied to the two crashes that led to the FAA grounding the plane for 20 months, an action that cost Boeing $20 billion and was lifted by the government in November 2020.As part of the deal, Boeing's board of directors will meet with relatives of those killed in the MAX crashes, the filing said.DOJ officials modified their process for selecting an independent monitor in response to backlash from one of the lawyers representing victims' relatives, who argued the families should select the candidate instead of the government choosing from a pool of candidates Boeing would propose, according to the court filing.U.S. officials adjusted their plea offer to Boeing to stipulate they would select the pool of qualified candidates based on a public solicitation to which anyone can apply, including candidates the families support.Lawyers for some of the families of the people killed in the two MAX crashes said they intended to exercise their right to oppose the deal.""The families intend to argue that the plea deal with Boeing unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive and fails to hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of 346 persons,"" they said in a separate court filing.The agreement does not shield any executives, the DOJ filing said, though charges against individuals are¬†seen as unlikely¬†due to the statute of limitations. A former Boeing chief technical pilot was charged in connection with the Boeing fraud¬†agreement but acquitted by a jury¬†in 2022.The agreed penalty will be Boeing's second fine of $243.6 million related to the fatal crashes ‚Äî bringing the full fine to the maximum allowed. The company paid the fine previously as part of 2021's $2.5 billion settlement. The $243.6 million fine represented the amount Boeing saved by not implementing full-flight simulator training for MAX pilots.Families of the victims of those crashes slammed the previous agreement and this year¬†pressed the Justice Department¬†to seek as much as $25 billion from Boeing.This year, the DOJ has held several meetings to hear from the victims' families as they investigated Boeing's breach of the 2021 deal.The DOJ and Boeing are working to document the full written plea agreement and file it in federal court in Texas by July 19, the DOJ said in the court filing.",0.0,True,"Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation linked to two 737 MAX fatal crashes.

It coincides with the start of a ballot in a ""bid to force Amazon to recognise a union for the first time"" in the country, the GMB union said. The US online retailer said their workers ""always have"" the choice to join a union however GMB filed legal proceedings in April against the firm, claiming they were ""engaged in widespread attempts to coerce staff to cancel their trade union membership"". A GMB spokesman said the ballot's results, which were expected on 15 July, could mean Amazon would be required to negotiate pay and conditions with them. The union has been struggling for the right to officially represent Amazon workers in Coventry for more than a decade.  It began its campaign for statutory recognition 18 months ago and there have been more than 30 days of strike action since early 2023.  About 3,000 workers at the Coventry site are expected to start voting on Monday on whether to have GMB representation. The union will also hold protests outside the firm's sites in Warrington, Carlisle and outside the head office in London. It follows a three-week period during which union representatives were given access to the site by the government's central arbitration committee.  Andy Prendergast, national secretary at GMB, said workers were concerned over ""pay and unsafe conditions"". ""Amazon has had every chance to do the right thing - now workers are taking things into their own hands to make work better,"" he added. A representative for Amazon, which was was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, said: ""Our employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union. They always have."" They added they ""regularly review"" pay, adding: ""Our minimum starting pay has increased to ¬£12.30 and ¬£13 per hour depending on location - that's a 20% increase over two years and 50% since 2018.

Attracting new talent to the ship design and building industry has become increasingly difficult, especially for smaller and mid-sized shipyards. In countries like Japan and Korea, the problem is amplified by demographics.This comes at a time when shipyards are seeing increased demand for newbuilds, with some orderbooks full until 2027 and beyond. Many are already facing delivery delays as a consequence of staff shortages. Adding to the challenge are increases in material costs, with steel prices remaining high, while inflation has pushed labour costs to historical highs.Without action to maximise the productivity of their existing workforce, both in design and construction teams, shipyards will not be able to seize the opportunities of a booming market, in which newbuild prices are nearing all-time highs. In the long run, they risk losing market share to their competitors.Mikko Forss, executive vice president for design solutions, NAPAAdding to an already complex picture, shipyards are not only competing for newbuild orders; they are also seeking to position themselves and develop their skillsets in emerging markets for vessels propelled with new fuels and technologies.The capacity to innovate will be a key differentiator going forward. Therefore, those players that can reduce delivery times and create better designs, all while maintaining financially healthy businesses, will gain a competitive edge. How to be smartWith all those factors coming together, boosting efficiency through innovative processes is more than a ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù for shipyards; those productivity improvements are critical to future-proof their businesses. This is leading to a fundamental shift: an acceleration in the digital transformation of the ship design industry.A strong example of how digitalisation is embedding itself in shipyards‚Äô strategy is HD Hyundai Heavy Industries, the world‚Äôs largest shipyard, which has entered a joint development project with NAPA and CADMATIC to develop a ‚Äúdigital shipyard‚Äù.The vision is to harness advanced 3D models and the latest developments in information management technology to optimise the ship design and building process. This will help the company achieve shorter schedules, lower costs, and higher quality in larger and more complex projects.In practice, the project will develop a next-generation ship design and information management system that will transform workflows, ensuring data consistency throughout the ship design process to save time and limit the risk of error. It will also enhance collaboration between the different departments and improve information-sharing between the hundreds ‚Äì if not thousands ‚Äì of people involved in the ship design and building process.Story continuesThis will help HD Hyundai Heavy Industries respond to growing shipowner demand for innovative energy-efficient designs and enhance its capacity to deliver next-generation ships powered by alternative fuels or equipped with new technologies, including batteries or wind propulsion.Digital and green go hand-in-handStreamlined processes and efficient communication are prerequisites for the era of fast-paced innovation ahead. This is because integrating new fuels and technologies brings new layers of complexity to the ship design process, requiring naval architects and engineers to explore unchartered technological territories.A strong digital foundation makes this innovation possible in a number of ways. Using 3D models as a ‚Äúsingle source of truth‚Äù from the very early stage and throughout the design process will enable concurrent engineering, where the different disciplines involved in a ship design can work simultaneously. This saves tremendous time and limits the risks of inconsistencies as the project progresses.3D capabilities are also increasingly used for classification approvals, allowing surveyors to perform checks directly using the 3D model that was created to design the vessel, rather than requiring multiple lengthy conversions to 2D drawings. Early adopters of ‚Äú3D model-based approvals‚Äù already report efficiency gains and improvements in the quality of designs.Operational simulation capabilities open a game-changing opportunity for designers and engineers.Furthermore, operational simulation capabilities open a game-changing opportunity for designers and engineers: testing the viability of completely new concepts from the early design phases. By combining 3D models with weather and operational data, they can virtually trial different iterations and predict how the future ship will perform on the specific routes where it will be operated.In practice, this will help them determine optimal configurations for ships powered by ammonia, methanol or batteries, or assess the impact of energy-saving appliances like wind propulsion ‚Äì whilst ensuring the vessel‚Äôs safety and stability.In the longer term, the ongoing information and technology revolution will unlock a world of opportunity for shipyards, from digital manufacturing to digital twins that could create value throughout a ship‚Äôs lifecycle ‚Äì helping optimise operations and maintenance schedules, for example.The road ahead is both challenging and exciting. Companies that harness digital capabilities to improve their efficiency will not only save time and add value to their designs today, but they will also build the right foundations to remain competitive in the markets of the future. In other words, shipyards that miss the digital boat today will lose out on business tomorrow.

Drivers also have to take GST out of their earnings as well.The change has been sold as a benefit to both customers and drivers, as better pricing would increase demand and therefore improve the opportunity for drivers to earn more.But Geoff said this could have the opposite effect.""It's a brain-dead idea...you're gonna lose all your drivers,"" he told to Yahoo Finance. ""They're all gonna go to DiDi...

MnuvwjG8H06wN4e,Seeking Alpha,google,Johnson & Johnson: Remaining A Buy Despite Remaining Risks (NYSE:JNJ),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702838-johnson-and-johnson-remaining-a-buy-despite-remaining-risks,2024-07-08 02:51,2024-07-08 02:59,JNJ,,"JHVEPhoto In my last article, I called Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) (NEOE:JNJ:CA) a very cautious √¢¬Ä¬úBuy√¢¬Ä¬ù but since my last article Johnson & Johnson continued to decline further and the stock lost about 9% in value during the last 10 months. Especially when comparing the performance to the S&P 500 (SPY) which increased 23% in the same timeframe, we have to see Johnson & Johnson rather as a disappointment. Johnson & Johnson is not really declining steeply, but the stock is slowly creeping lower and has reached price levels not seen for almost 4 years. And with the stock now being almost 10% cheaper than last time, let√¢¬Ä¬ôs look at the company and stock again to determine if it is a good investment now. Valuation Multiples A first hint to answer the question if Johnson & Johnson is a good investment comes from the simple valuation multiples √¢¬Ä¬ì especially the price-earnings ratio. In the following chart I only look at data from the last five years, as triple digit valuation multiples in the meantime would completely distort the picture. Right now, Johnson & Johnson is trading for 9.7 times earnings, and this is clearly the lowest valuation multiple in the last five years. And although this is not visible in the chart, it is also the lowest valuation multiple in at least the last 35 years (I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt have data prior to that). Data by YCharts When looking at the price-free-cash-flow ratio, the picture is a little different. Right now, Johnson & Johnson is trading for 20 times free cash flow √¢¬Ä¬ì a valuation multiple that is neither cheap nor expensive. It is also slightly below the 5-year average of 22.44. So, while the P/E ratio is clearly telling us that Johnson & Johnson is undervalued, the P/FCF is not giving us such clear hints to buy the stock (rather indicating to hold at this point). Quarterly Results Next, let√¢¬Ä¬ôs look at the results of Johnson & Johnson to get a better picture. On April 16, 2024, Johnson & Johnson reported first quarter results and sales increased slightly from $20,894 million in Q1/23 to $21,383 million in Q1/24 √¢¬Ä¬ì resulting in 2.3% year-over-year growth. Diluted earnings per share switched from a loss of $0.19 in the same quarter last year to $2.20 in earnings per share this quarter. Additionally, we can also look at adjusted earnings per share, which increased 12.4% year-over-year from $2.41 in Q1/23 to $2.71 in Q1/24. Johnson & Johnson Q1/24 Investor Presentation Johnson & Johnson also updated its guidance. Management is now expecting adjusted operating sales to increase between 5.5% and 6.0% and reported sales are expected to be around $88 billion (resulting in about 5% top line growth). Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in a range between $10.57 and $10.72 √¢¬Ä¬ì basically the same as last time only guidance was narrowed. Johnson & Johnson Q1/24 Investor Presentation Segment Results When looking at the segment results, Johnson & Johnson is now reporting in two different segments (when my last article was published, the company was still reporting in three different segments). In the first quarter, MedTech reported $7,821 million in revenue, which resulted in 4.5% year-over-year growth. However, the segment was negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points due to fewer selling days. And in cardiovascular, which was previously referred to as the Interventional Solutions segment, electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.9% in all regions. Johnson & Johnson Q1/24 Investor Presentation When looking at the Innovative Medicines segment, reported revenue was $13,562 million and this resulted in 1.1% year-over-year growth. However, when excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales grew 8.3% - both worldwide and outside the United States. Growth was driven both by key brands as well as recently launched products taking market shares. This includes Tremfya, which grew 26.3% year-over-year, Durant growing 15.7% year-over-year, Spravato increased 72.2% year-over-year and Erleada grew 27.0% year-over-year. But it was especially Darzalex, which increased 18.9% year-over-year to $2,692 million in quarterly revenue and is therefore one of the most important products of Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson Q1/24 Investor Presentation Growth: Buybacks and Acquisitions Similar to every other company, Johnson & Johnson has several ways to grow its business. Improving margins, buying back shares, being innovative and introducing new products. In the following section, we focus on two ways √¢¬Ä¬ì share buybacks and acquisitions. Johnson & Johnson is growing a little bit by buying back shares. And although Johnson & Johnson accelerated share buybacks in the recent past, it is still not buying back with the same aggressive pace as some other companies. Data by YCharts In the last 20 years, the company reduced the number of outstanding shares from around 3 billion to 2.43 billion right now. This is resulting in a CAGR of 1.05% during the last 20 years. However, in the last five years, share buybacks were accelerated and Johnson & Johnson√¢¬Ä¬ôs share buybacks contributed about 2% annually to the bottom line. Another way to grow is by acquisitions. With $25.1 billion in long-term debt (as well as $8.6 billion in short-term notes and loans), Johnson & Johnson has some debt on its balance sheet. But at the same time, the company has $25.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and $745 million in marketable securities. And although the balance sheet is not perfect, it is enabling Johnson & Johnson to make some acquisitions. However, we must take into account that Johnson & Johnson used $13.1 billion for the acquisition of Shockwave Medical in the meantime (we will get to this). Recently, Johnson & Johnson acquired the dermatology-focused biotech company Proteologix for $850 million. The acquisition closed in Mid-June, but the acquisition of such a small business won√¢¬Ä¬ôt have any measurable impact on Johnson & Johnson top and bottom line right now. The company mostly has early-stage drugs in its portfolio, and it probably will take a while before these pharmaceuticals can contribute to revenue (and earnings per share). Additionally, Johnson & Johnson acquired Shockwave Medical, and the acquisition was completed at the end of May 2024. The business was acquired for $13.1 billion and will extend the position of Johnson & Johnson in cardiovascular intervention (one of the fastest growing medtech markets). During the last earnings call, CFO Joseph J. Wolk commented on the Shockwave Medical acquisition: Earlier this month, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Shockwave Medical. Johnson & Johnson has a long history of addressing cardiovascular disease through both our Innovative Medicine and MedTech businesses. The acquisition of Shockwave with its leading intravascular lithotripsy or IVL technology will provide us with a unique opportunity to impact coronary artery and peripheral artery disease, two of the highest growth innovation oriented segments within cardiovascular intervention. This addition is not only adjacent to our other cardiovascular businesses but also consistent with our strategy of becoming a best-in-class MedTech company. During the first quarter, we also expanded our Innovative Medicine portfolio with the completion of the Ambrx acquisition. With its promising pipeline and ADC platform, Ambrx will further strengthen our oncology portfolio and ability to deliver enhanced precision biologics that treat cancer. However, there are two aspects we should take into account. At first, we must subtract $13.1 billion from the cash reserves that Johnson & Johnson used in the meantime for the Shockwave Medical acquisition. Additionally, as mentioned during the last earnings call, Johnson & Johnson is building some reserves in cash it might need for a resolution of the talc litigation √¢¬Ä¬ì one of the major problems and risks Johnson & Johnson is facing right now. Risk I: Litigation Lawsuits are always a risk for a business and for its investors, as we are dealing with several unknowns and factors hard to anticipate. Not only do we not know if and how much a company must pay. Additionally, these lawsuits can take several years, and it is difficult to know beforehand when the problems might be resolved. Johnson & Johnson is facing tens of thousands of lawsuits in the United States due to its talc products √¢¬Ä¬ì more than 50,000 claims have been filed against the company, mostly on behalf of women who developed ovarian cancer. Recently, the company offered to pay $6.5 billion to settle allegations that its talc products caused cancer. The proposal would settle 99.75% of the pending talc lawsuits in the United States. Johnson & Johnson Cancer Talc Claims Presentation In some cases, the company has already reached a settlement of $700 million in a nationwide settlement resolving allegations that it misled customers about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing. The settlement is still pending judicial approval, but in case it is approved, Johnson & Johnson will make four payments and the company will also permanently stop the manufacturing, promotion and sale of its baby powder and other body and cosmetics products that contain talcum powder. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson has already set aside reserves for the lawsuits and settlements. Right now, Johnson & Johnson is reporting a total nominal value of reserves of $13.7 billion. But Johnson & Johnson would not be the first company seeming close to a settlement but still taking several years until the issue is finally resolved. And although we have reasons to be optimistic about Johnson & Johnson, there are also reasons to remain cautious about how the settlement will finally turn out. Risk II: The Chart A second reason to remain cautious about an investment in Johnson & Johnson is the chart. In the last few quarters, the stock constantly moved lower and recently, the stock broke a supporting trendline which was connecting the lows of the Great Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 lows. And although it is just one line in a chart, it is indicating that lower stock prices might be possible. JNJ Monthly Chart (Author's work created with TradingView) It also seems possible that a bigger correction of the last upward wave, which started in 2009, is beginning and such a correction probably would take the stock lower. The range between $110 and $120 seems like a first potential target in such a scenario. Here we find previous lows of the chart (the lows from the COVID-19 crash in early 2020) and the 200-month simple moving average. Although this is rather speculation at this point, lower stock prices seem possible in the coming months. Intrinsic Value Calculation In the end, it comes down to an intrinsic value calculation to determine if Johnson & Johnson is a good investment. As a basis, we can take the free cash flow of the last four quarters, which was $18.23 billion and seems like a reasonable amount. Free cash flow already declined a little bit from its previous peak of $22.56 billion. We are also calculating with 2,430 million outstanding shares and a 10% discount rate. Data by YCharts In my last article, I calculated 6% growth till perpetuity. In the last ten years, Johnson & Johnson actually grew with a CAGR of 11.05% but such a high growth rate is extremely unrealistic for such a mature business. Operating income, on the other hand, grew only at a CAGR of 2.13%. And when looking at analysts√¢¬Ä¬ô estimates for the years to come, I would also argue that 6% growth is certainly an ambitious target for Johnson & Johnson, but a target that is realistic and achievable. When calculating with these assumptions we get an intrinsic value of $187.55 for Johnson & Johnson and considering that the stock is currently trading for $146 at the time of writing we can call the stock undervalued. Even when being a little more cautious and calculate only with 5% growth for the years to come, the stock would still be slightly undervalued, and we can argue that a margin of safety is also included in our calculation at this point. Upcoming earnings In less than two weeks, Johnson & Johnson will report second quarter results. And the picture among analysts seems to be mixed. For the next quarter, we see more up revisions than down revisions for revenue, but more down revisions for earnings per share than up revisions. And overall, we see estimates being lowered slightly over time, which is also not a good sign. When earnings and revenue estimates constantly are lowered, it is not a good sign for the business and also speaking for a rather bearish sentiment. Conclusion Johnson & Johnson remains a √¢¬Ä¬úBuy√¢¬Ä¬ù at this point. We certainly should not expect fireworks at this point, and also not in the years to come. But over the long run, Johnson & Johnson will continue to pay a dividend to its shareholders and the stock will move higher. However, in the short-to-mid-term, the risk of lower stock prices remains, and one could also try to wait for lower stock prices.  In my opinion, Johnson & Johnson is an investment that offers stability and consistency, but not necessary have the potential for extremely high returns. Johnson & Johnson is rather one of the companies that can be seen as a bond-like investment, generating returns not only via a coupon (dividend payments) but also by an increasing stock price.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

HEz5EvB33driOD5,Seeking Alpha,bing,MercadoLibre: It May Be Just The Beginning Of A Great Rally,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702840-mercadolibre-it-may-be-just-the-beginning-of-a-great-rally,2024-07-08 03:35,2024-07-08 03:48,ARM,,"NosUA About three months ago, I published my first article on MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), whose shares were trading around $1,360 apiece at the time. I was of the opinion that the contraction in margins in the fourth quarter was probably a one-off event and that the company was very well positioned for the long term with its investments. My discounted free cash flow valuation model [DCF] indicated an undervaluation of at least 40%. Over the last three months, the stock is up 21.6%, almost twice as much as the broad market index S&P 500 (SP500) (SPY). I was lucky enough to basically ""catch the local low"" in MELI 3 months ago: My previous article on MELI Today, after updating my DCF model and reviewing the company's latest financials, my opinion remains unchanged: I believe that MELI's growth investments in recent quarters and the momentum of its business acceleration point to continued growth for MercadoLibre stock. Therefore, I'm updating my rating and remaining bullish on the company. Why Do I Think So? In case you hear about MELI for the first time, let me give you a little description. MercadoLibre is an $84-billion market-cap e-commerce ecosystem online and leading fintech platform - the biggest of its kind in Latin America - operating in 18 nations such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. It has its safety shopping cart software that securely takes care of all kinds of merchandise transactions for consumers and sellers, thus making it a popular choice where over 650 people reside. In addition to granting individuals digital accounts, debit cards, online payments, insurance policies, savings vehicles, investments, and personal credit lines; MercadoPago also offers payment processing solutions to merchants. Looking at the latest quarter results (Q1 FY2024), we see that MELI reported a total revenue of ~$4.3 billion, a 36% increase from the previous year. What seemed interesting to me was the fact that in Brazil and Mexico, MELI's gross merchandise volume (GMV) surged by ~30% YoY, fueled by ""enhanced user experience, strategic infrastructure investments, and successful marketing efforts"", as the management commented during the earnings call. Why it was interesting to me? Because I think it's important to understand here that MercadoLibre is already a major player in Latin America, and such a substantial GMV growth over just one year looks stunning. MELI's IR materials The company's advertising sector and its fintech division, MercadoPago, also saw significant gains: Notably, the acquiring business, credit portfolio, and TPV experienced remarkable growth, with TPV hitting $1.9 billion, marking a 133% increase from the previous year. Although the total operating profit margin declined by 395 basis points YoY to ~12.2%, net income rose to $344 million, marking a 71.14% YoY increase, beating the consensus estimates by a really wide margin. Seeking Alpha, author's notes After the company presented its Q1 results, however, analysts had a somewhat mixed impression - the estimates for the next quarter, which the company is set to publish on August 2, have changed upwards and downwards in roughly equal measure. In other words, estimates have not increased significantly overall, suggesting that analysts aren't particularly optimistic bullish on MELI's upcoming Q2 report. In my opinion, Mercado Libre has significant positive attributes that analysts should appreciate. First, I'm impressed by the growth trajectory of its operating cash flow. Being essentially a smooth transition from net income, MELI's OCF is almost double that of last year, indicating that Mercado Libre's operations are quite effective if it can generate such substantial cash flow growth. This is a very critical characteristic for any prospective investor, in my view. MELI's cash flow statement, the author's notes added Second, despite some skepticism about the recent decline in margins, it appears that the company's investment projects are actually bearing fruit and leading to higher top-line growth. I like the management's focus on improving the user experience and making strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in fast-growing areas. Going forward, I believe MELI's well-executed marketing campaign will leverage the publicity generated during the peak season to generate more interactions, as the management expects (based on the earnings call commentary). In addition, the advertising business should continue its growth trajectory by achieving regular GMV penetration in all markets. Third, I believe MercadoPago - MercadoLibre's fintech arm - should drive further high-quality (i.e. profitable) growth in the future quarters. According to the latest IR materials, MercadoLibre's fintech division's MAU increased by 38% YoY, with Brazil leading the growth; Argentina also showed good momentum due to the strong value proposition of Mercado Pago amidst high inflation. The total assets under management amount grew by 90% YoY, with Brazil and Mexico more than doubling, and Argentina showing strong growth both annually and quarterly. The credit portfolio expanded by 46% YoY, driven by a 132% increase in the credit card portfolio (particularly in Brazil and Mexico). Despite a 43% YoY decline in Argentina's credit portfolio due to the devaluation of the peso, it began to grow again on a quarterly basis, which is also a good sign. So from what I see, MercadoPago is focused on maintaining its strength in Mexico and Brazil through a growing acquiring business and credit portfolio. So the growth of the company's fintech segment is therefore likely to accelerate further. I like that even significant macroeconomic challenges in certain regions of Latin America haven't hindered MercadoLibre's growth in these areas (so we may assume that a stabilization of the macroeconomic environment could further accelerate growth). Fourth, MELI also seeks to enhance its logistics network via the Meli M√É¬°s program, thereby improving efficiency and involvement: The largest e-commerce platform in Latin America aims to strengthen its delivery capabilities. In my point of view, MELI's margins should also get better over a number of quarters through the optimization of logistical processes. With these margins leveling out we can start to expect the acceleration of operating profit growth, which is likely still not priced in. To be fair, however, it should be noted that not all Wall Street analysts hold the seemingly neutral sentiment. Analysts at Jefferies gave MercadoLibre a ""Buy"" rating backing May 2024, forecasting that the company's revenue will triple by the end of 2024 compared to its peak in 2021. Jefferies has set an upwardly revised target price of $2,000 while increasing its 2024 revenue projection by 10% and its 2026 estimate by 15%. Let's focus on the consensus first and adjust it to reflect the most realistic developments for the next few years. I will only use the sales forecasts and take them as the ultimate truth. Why? As I noted in my previous article, this approach is in line with the principle of conservatism, as the company has only missed its sales estimates once since 2012. For the EBIT margin, I expect a smooth transition to a margin of 35% by the end of the forecast period (FY 2028). Other key figures, such as the ratio of D&A to sales or CAPEX to sales, will be in line with historical norms. In addition, the effective tax rate in my model will gradually return to the level of many years ago (25%). Here's the result of my calculations at this stage: FinChat, MELI, the author's notes Getting to the discount rate calculation part, I'll simply assume that MELI's current borrowing rate is ~8% and that the large variation between the risk-free rate of 4.39% is caused by geographical risk. In addition, the MRP will also be above its typical figure of 5% (at 7.9%) as there are higher expectations among investors theoretically since they have to choose non-American equities in order to earn high returns. As a result, it gives a WACC of 15.4%, which might seem too much; nevertheless, bear in mind that this company is still growing quickly, and it has huge risks involved. FinChat, MELI, the author's notes Next comes a tricky assumption: the terminal value calculation. FinChat's template model that I use only allows us to use the EV/FCF ratio, and by that measure, MELI looks very cheap today: The COVID period distorts the long-term view, but the current multiple of 15x (vs. Amazon's (AMZN) 44x as of today) shows that the multiple has dropped significantly in the last year. Just as before, I believe this multiple will rise as the company's margins improve - with better margins, we'll have more visibility into FCF, which the market should appreciate. Therefore, I've set an EV/FCF multiple target of 20x by FY2028. All of the above forecasts lead me to conclude that the company's shares have become even more undervalued since my last model update. Despite the stock's growth of more than 20%, the current undervaluation stands at 50.5%, which is quite significant. This suggests a price target of almost $2,400, well above Jefferies' May estimate of $2,000: FinChat, MELI, the author's notes As you see, MercadoLibre somehow became even more undervalued over the past 3 months despite its recovery rally. Therefore, I reiterate my bullish rating, believing that the recovery we saw recently is just the beginning of a greater long-term rally in the stock price. Where Can I Be Wrong? I admit that we shouldn't ignore some very important risks to my today's thesis. First off, currency fluctuations, particularly if the Argentine Peso devalues, could impact MELI's financial results and challenge my expectations for margin expansion. Similarly, the firm's lending operations face risks if borrowers struggle to repay loans, leading to higher costs and deteriorating credit quality. Also, among other things, intense competition in the payments sector might require increased spending on customer acquisition and could result in slower growth. This means the consensus revenue and EBIT figures I've assumed in my DCF update might not fully support my conclusions. To be honest, the biggest risks in my valuation model come from the assumptions about the company's future operating profit margin. If we assume that the margin stabilizes at 20% by 2028 instead of 35%, the undervaluation of the company would disappear if all other factors remain the same. This is what the fair value calculation would look like if we assume that the margin peaks at 20% by the end of 2028. FinChat, MELI, the author's notes So if you agree with my conclusions, you should also agree with my assumptions about the company's EBIT margins. If you have a different perspective on that, then MercadoLibre may be too risky for you as a long-term investment, so think twice, and please do your own due diligence (as you always should). The Verdict Despite the risks described above, I'm quite optimistic about MercadoLibre's strategic trajectory and business momentum in recent quarters. The company is investing heavily to capture as much of the Latin American market as possible. The environment is highly competitive, but judging by recent growth rates, MercadoLibre appears to be achieving its goals in most areas. This is crucial for the long-term growth prospects. I appreciate that the company remains cash flow positive (the OCF is expanding rapidly) and has high growth rates despite its scale. Furthermore, Latin America is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, providing a solid base for MercadoLibre to maximize its projects. According to my DCF valuation model, the company is currently undervalued by 50.5% - this significant undervaluation is hard to ignore, although it is based on some risky assumptions that I firmly believe in. I think the company can reach an operating profit margin of 35% by the end of 2028 - if this rapid margin expansion materializes along with relatively conservative assumptions for other factors, the stock could indeed rise to $2,300-$2,500 in the next few quarters. My technical analysis suggests a bullish outlook for MercadoLibre. The seasonality of MELI stock is favorable, as July has been the most profitable month in the last 10 years, giving hope that this July will also be positive. This short-term perspective is complemented by a long-term view: significant resistance levels need to be overcome on the weekly chart, but the overall trend remains bullish as the price stays firmly above the 52-week moving average. TrendSpider Software, MELI, the author's notes added I believe that this long-term uptrend will continue. Hence, my ""Buy"" rating upgrade today.  Thank you for reading! Hold On!

KjWKHp53b9yD7Ua,Seeking Alpha,google,Uber: Delivery Is The Only Near-Time Growth Driver That Matters,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702848-uber-technologies-stock-delivery-only-near-time-growth-driver-matters-buy,2024-07-08 04:23,2024-07-08 04:33,UBER,,"Ceri Breeze Investment Thesis Last mile delivery has emerged as a standout solutions gap that is constantly requiring the need to be addressed, especially in a post-pandemic world. The solutions gap exists in both ends of the delivery market, namely the supply chain side as well as the consumer retail side where companies such as DoorDash (DASH) and UBER (NYSE:UBER) are heavily investing to expand infrastructure and network capacity to build ramps towards accretive growth. Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs rapid investments in the delivery and retail fulfillment space have given it a massive leg up over its one-time peer Lyft. At the same time, Uber now lags DoorDash, a direct peer in the delivery space, by a marginal difference in volume of delivery-based gross bookings. But what sets Uber apart from all its peers is its ability to deliver profitable growth while returning shareholder value to its investors at a rate that still remains to be matched by Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs peers. The insights from a few investor conferences over the last few months have been enough to convince me that Uber will be a strong winner over the next few years, leading me to recommend a Strong Buy rating on the company. Here√¢¬Ä¬ôs Why Delivery is Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs Key Near-term Growth Driver At its 2024 Investor Day conference earlier this year, Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs incoming CFO explained how the pandemic had helped boost growth in the Gross Bookings volume on Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs app platform. As shown in Exhibit A below, Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs Gross Bookings volume from its Delivery business, which accounted for slightly over a quarter of Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs total Gross Bookings in 2019, now accounts for slightly under half of Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs overall Gross Bookings volume, per its recent Q1 10-Q. Between 2019 and 2023, Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs implied CAGR growth rate of 45% posted by Delivery Gross Bookings volume far outpaced its overall Gross Bookings volume CAGR of 21% during the same period. Uber positioned itself in a formidable position to benefit from the oncoming tailwinds that its Delivery business would see from the pandemic lockdowns.   Exhibit A: Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs Delivery business significantly outpaces the over compounded growth rate of its gross bookings (2024 Investor Day Conference, Uber) Uber demonstrated significant dexterity at the time to utilize its network capacity of drivers to expand its Delivery business and, at one time, also started leading its peers in Delivery Gross Bookings volume as seen in Exhibit B below.   Exhibit B: Gross bookings volume of Delivery segments of Uber versus its peers (Companies' sources) Currently, DoorDash continues to lead in Gross Bookings and is also rapidly investing in its Delivery business, more specifically in grocery deliveries, which I covered in recent coverage. However, unlike DoorDash, what sets Uber miles apart is its ability to deliver profits while also rapidly growing its Delivery business. While Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs Delivery segment outpaced the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs overall top line growth in terms of gross bookings and revenue, the Delivery segment also increased its EBITDA by 173% y/y in FY23 to $1.5 billion on an adjusted basis. At the same time, Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs Delivery segment also added an additional 37% to Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs FY23 adj. EBITDA, which ended last year at $4.1 billion. In a recent conference with Bernstein, Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs CFO explained how the company benefits from its Delivery business in further detail:    Beyond just the food delivery and groceries, we're also now doing quite a bit in the retail space. And in areas that I think you may not as be as sort of directly aware of that is being done by Uber. If you order your iPhone from the Apple store for delivery, if you order Walmart to have it delivered from the Walmart website, it is our crew that is -- it's our earners that are delivering that. If you order McDonald's from the app or from Uber Eats, it's likely in both cases being delivered by Uber. So this allows us to drive the densification of the network. And then lastly, I would highlight that, let's go through some of the numbers here, right? Delivery grew 17% in the first quarter. And that's on again, roughly half of our revenue. Of that growth, we saw almost just under 50% of that from new users coming on the platform. So increase in monthly actives.  The most interesting point from the excerpt above was the CFO√¢¬Ä¬ôs insight on network density, where the company has already built out an extensive network of drivers via its Mobility segment, and Uber is benefiting from economies of scale from those prior investments. An example of dense networks can be seen in another slide that I have borrowed from its Investor Day conference in Exhibit C below.   Exhibit C: More countries generated profits for Uber in its Delivery business versus its Mobility business (2024 Investor Day Conference, Uber) As can be seen in Exhibit C, Uber was able to generate ~4% midpoint EBITDA margins in the majority of countries that it operated in via its Delivery business versus its Mobility business. And it does not appear the growth in delivery segment EBITDA is slowing relative to the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs overall growth. In Q1 FY24, while Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs overall adjusted EBITDA grew 82% y/y to $1382 million in Q1, its Delivery segment grew adj. EBITDA by 83% to $528 million, still outpacing the overall adj. EBITDA. In my opinion, Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs delivery business appears to be not just competing with its peers for Gross Bookings market share; the growth demonstrated by Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs Delivery segment looks solid and sustainable, giving the company strong legs to grow from here on. Uber appears to be doubling down on growing its Delivery business outside of organic growth rates by making some acquisitions in this space. Most recently, it acquired Delivery Hero√¢¬Ä¬ôs foodpanda delivery business in Taiwan for $950 million in cash. In addition, Uber has also partnered with Waymo to allow residents in Phoenix to get their food delivered via Waymo' fully autonomous vehicles. While many market participants appear to be excited by Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs Mobility business and other edge technologies such as robotaxis, etc., I believe Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs Delivery business is already demonstrating robust top-line and bottom-line growth and will be the most important differentiator for Uber to stand out over the next 2-3 years. Valuation Points To Robust Upside For Uber My assumptions for building out Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs valuation model are based on the growth targets that were laid out in the 2024 Investor Day conference and were again categorically reiterated by the new CFO at the Bernstein conference I mentioned earlier. I have attached a screenshot of this below in Exhibit D.   Exhibit D: Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs 3 year operating model (2024 Investor Day Conference, Uber) Based on the current growth rates and management projections, I expect Uber to grow their Gross Bookings on their platform by ~14.2% CAGR through FY26. Management has also indicated that they expect to maintain the current take rate on their platform, which I estimate at ~27.2% over the same time period, and therefore, revenue growth rates should be ~15% CAGR through FY26. Over the same investment horizon, I estimate Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs adj. EBITDA will grow by ~35% CAGR. I believe this will be driven by the economies of scale and the network benefits that the company is already enjoying, as demonstrated by its Delivery business, which I have detailed earlier throughout this research note. This implies 5 points of margin expansion by next year or 8 points of expansion by FY26. While Uber has announced a $7 billion share buyback program, I believe they will still need to hire talent and incentivize using stock-based compensation, so I am assuming the share buyback program will be offset by higher stock comps. Therefore, through FY26, I am assuming a ~2.5% share dilution rate. I am also assuming a 10% discount rate.   Exhibit E: Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs stock presents significant upside from current levels (Author) The implied growth rates in Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs earnings based on the assumptions in my model warrant a forward earnings multiple of 33√¢¬Ä¬ì35x, since Uber would far outpace the long-term earnings growth rates of the S&P 500. My FY25 target price of ~$96 for Uber implies an upside of 35%, which is significant for investors. Risks & Other Factors To Consider An important risk that continues to impact the stock from time to time is the implication of regulation in terms of labor costs. Most delivery and mobility companies, such as Uber, are subject to constant scrutiny from regulators regarding the hourly wages paid to their delivery drivers. In the EU, lawmakers have voted to keep the current set of regulations for gig workers more or less unchanged, which actually benefits Uber. But in the U.S., Uber has been busy managing relatively stronger regulatory headwinds than in the EU. For example, in NYC, Uber has slotted drivers from joining the platform at a pace that it would like to increase due to wage laws, which may lead to distortions in customer wait times to connect to delivery drivers and/or receive deliveries via the app. In other extreme cases, Uber may even decide to exit markets entirely if the cost of managing regulations exceeds its costs of operations in that regulatory environment. For example, in April, Uber indicated that they would exit Minneapolis after a minimum wage rule for drivers was voted for in the city. However, that has been pushed out to July. So far, Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs management has demonstrated that it can manage regulatory headwinds, but its inability to do so in the future would impact growth rates in its booking volumes, revenues, EBITDA, etc. Takeaway While Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs mobility business is continuing to grow, the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs Delivery business is posting robust growth rates not only in terms of its gross bookings but also in terms of its adjusted EBITDA. This is unique for the company, since its peers are still struggling to operate their own delivery-based businesses profitably, while Uber generates strong profits as it benefits from the platform network infrastructure laid out by its Mobility business.  There is a significant runway in the performance that Uber can yet deliver in terms of earnings and bookings, which provides a compelling case for the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs valuation. Based on my evaluation of Uber, I recommend it as a Strong Buy.",0.0,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
lblf2M6M0vah9MV,Seeking Alpha,google,Nvidia Stock: Why Holding Strong Makes Sense For Existing Shareholders (NASDAQ:NVDA),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702853-nvidia-stock-holding-strong-makes-sense-for-existing-shareholders,2024-07-08 04:57,2024-07-08 05:03,NVDA,,"BING-JHEN HONG Since I last wrote about NVIDIA (NVDA) (NEOE:NVDA:CA) with a downgrade to hold, it briefly became the highest-valued company globally, reaching a market cap of $3.34 trillion. Of the top five largest global companies, it has risen the highest this year, far outdistancing its peers. Data by YCharts It may still have more gas in the tank. Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Joseph Moore increased his price target on the stock to $144 from $116 on July 1. A Seeking Alpha article stated, ""Recent checks from Taiwan and China were more than enough to keep the firm confident on near-term numbers and the catalyst path remains ""strong,"" analyst Joseph Moore wrote, citing the ""very strong surge"" in H20 builds."" The reference to ""H20 builds"" is a graphics processing unit (""GPU"") based AI chip that NVIDIA is still able to supply to China for AI training.  Investors should also remember that the company will release the new AI Blackwell chip family shortly. Seeking Alpha published an article in March 2024 quoting the same analyst Joseph Moore discussing Blackwell's impact and the company's positioning:  ""It will take time to evaluate the performance claims for Blackwell, but if they hold up even directionally, our sense is that the company's ability to raise the bar this much leaves them in a very strong position,"" Moore added. ""While most of the larger cloud customers remain committed to alternative AI solutions - custom or merchant - they all have limited rack space given ecosystem constraints (with multiple hyperscalers waiting to power up new facilities). Limited rack space is going to lead to cloud vendors choosing the highest ROI [return on investment] solution, which we continue to think is represented by NVIDIA."" Since my last article on the company, the stock has been up 38.43% compared to the S&P 500's (SPX) rise of 7.36%. Some NVIDIA bulls may wonder why I downgraded the stock to hold when it looks like it has more upside. The biggest reason that I downgraded it to hold is that investors that buy into the stock today are making massive assumptions about revenue, earnings, and free cash flow (""FCF"") growth beyond fiscal year (""FY"") 2026, where the risks are higher that it may fail to hit the mark. Unless one has keen insights into the semiconductor market and its dynamics, it's wise to proceed cautiously. This article will discuss NVIDIA's primary competitive threat, its plans to counter it, and future company expectations. It will also review the stock's valuation and explain why I am reiterating my Hold recommendation. ASICs are a threat NVIDIA's rise in relevance in artificial intelligence (""AI"") came from its GPU being the ideal chip for training AI algorithms. Shortly after OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) introduced ChatGPT to the world, companies from large to small became interested in training large language models to create their own homegrown chatbots. A UBS Group (UBS) report states: While most platform and semiconductor companies don't provide a breakdown of AI chips' end-usage, we believe inferencing accounted for less than 10% of AI computing chip demand in 2023, versus 90% for training. With the increased usage of generative AI and the rising number of queries per user, we expect inferencing's share to increase to over 20% by 2025. The high demand for training chips overwhelming benefits NVIDIA since GPUs are the preferred chip type for training AI algorithms, and NVIDIA is the dominant GPU chip provider. Also, the early days of generative AI have seen most training take place on large cloud providers like Alphabet's (GOOGL)(GOOG) Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, and Amazon's (AMZN) AWS, which are a few of only several large companies that can afford to put together enough large AI-chip clusters to rapidly and effectively train AI algorithms. Most companies train their AI using the resources of at least one of the large cloud providers.  However, there is an opposing point of view. Some already think more companies buy chips for inferencing than training. Inferencing is when a trained AI model generates insights on newly acquired data. The following pie chart comes from the market intelligence company IDTechEx. IDTechEx Some NVIDIA detractors believe that the more the AI market shifts toward inferencing chips, the more competitive the market will become for the company. The problem with using GPUs for inferencing is that they consume too much power and generate too much heat for various applications. Power efficiency becomes necessary as generative AI moves to more edge devices such as self-driving cars, AI computers, mobile phones, and Internet of Things (""IoT"") devices. Power consumption has also become a problem for cloud providers that are providing AI resources. The website Carbon Credits published an article that said, ""Data centers could consume between 4.6% and 9.1% of US electricity by 2030, according to an analysis by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)."" That's a severe drain on the electrical grid. Application-specific integrated Circuit (ASIC) technology may solve power consumption problems in inference chips. ASIC technology has been around since at least 1967. Google pioneered customizing ASICs specifically for machine learning use. The company developed an ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (""TPU"") chip for internal use in 2015 (later made available for third parties in 2018). The TPU is especially useful for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a valuable deep-learning algorithm for image recognition. Generally, ASICs have lower power consumption and may also have better performance characteristics for a specific task than GPUs. These days, Google is not the only cloud provider with an ASIC; Amazon has developed an inference ASIC specifically for generative AI and deep learning named AWS Inferentia. Microsoft has its Maia 100 AI chip for AI and generative AI. The big cloud providers are not the only ones developing customized chips. Large traditional chipmakers such as Intel Corporation (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell Technology (MRVL), and QUALCOMM (QCOM) have developed or are developing customized chips for customers. Additionally, several smaller companies have arisen over the last decade to compete in the customized AI chip arena. These companies include Untether AI, Habana, and Groq.  One single chip manufacturer doesn't threaten NVIDIA; it's a collective army of chip manufacturers and some of its customers bringing chip production in-house that threatens NVIDIA long-term. Austin Lyons, the author of Chipstrat, states the risk clearly and succinctly (emphasis added):  Nvidia derives a considerable portion of their revenue from a small number of clients purchasing AI GPUs, which are inferior to AI ASICs. Worse, their best customers have the strongest motivation to transition to these ASICs. Additionally, the emergence of custom AI chips promises to erode Nvidia's AI GPU margins. NVIDIA Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") Jensen Huang is aware of this risk and has already taken action. How NVIDIA competes against ASICs The GPU provider tries to outdo the competition in the inference market in several ways, including using GPUs with Tensor Core, developing specialized SoCs (System-on-Chips) for edge computing applications, and competing directly with companies like Broadcom and Marvell in the customized AI chip market. 1. NVIDIA Tensor Core Tensor Cores are specialized AI accelerators integrated into a GPU. Tensor Cores make GPUs more useful for modern-day AI applications such as deep learning by improving their performance characteristics and power efficiency compared to a GPU without the Tensor Core. NVIDIA designed its original GPUs to perform graphical computations to generate images, videos, and animations on a computer monitor. While GPUs without Tensor Core are well suited for generating images on a computer screen and are still helpful for some AI training applications, Tensor Core helps GPUs be more competitive with the performance of customized ASIC chips while remaining more flexible for tasks outside AI. NVIDIA Tensor Cores are similar to Google's TPUs, with the main difference being that TPUs operate as standalone ASIC chips while Tensor cores integrate into GPU architectures. The need for GPUs likely won't completely disappear, and the company's efforts in developing power-efficient GPUs designed for inference tasks should help its competition with ASIC providers. Some examples of Tensor Core chips are the H100 Tensor Core GPU, H200 Tensor Core GPU, and the Blackwell GPU architecture, which NVIDIA should release in either late 2024 or early 2025. An NVIDIA press release states, ""The GB200 NVL72 [Blackwell chips] provides up to a 30x performance increase compared to the same number of NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs for LLM inference workloads, and reduces cost and energy consumption by up to 25x."" 2. Deep Learning Accelerator The company created the Deep Learning Accelerator (""DLA"") to address the need for edge computing applications with limited space or power requirements. NVIDIA describes DLAs on its website (emphasis added): NVIDIA's AI platform at the edge gives you the best-in-class compute for accelerating deep learning workloads. DLA is the fixed-function hardware that accelerates deep learning workloads on these platforms, including the optimized software stack for deep learning inference workloads. While NVIDIA avoids using the term ASICs in the above explanation, some speculate that DLAs are custom ASICs designed for specific deep learning tasks on different edge computing platforms. The way the company describes DLAs, they don't appear to use them as standalone devices but more as hardware accelerators for deep learning on a specialized SoC, which may also incorporate CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs. The company uses DLAs in its Jetson platform, which the company also describes on its website, ""The Jetson platform includes small, power-efficient production modules and developer kits that offer the most comprehensive AI software stack for high-performance acceleration to power Generative AI at the edge, NVIDIA Metropolis and the Isaac platform."" NVIDIA Metropolis is a platform that enables IoT devices, and the Isaac platform provides tools for developing robots. Some other Jetson platforms include:   Jetson Nano: The company designed this platform for edge AI applications requiring only a tiny amount of processing power and little need for a large memory footprint, such as basic image recognition.    Jetson Xavier: It designed this platform to address basic autonomous machine applications that need more processing power than Nano yet still requires solid power efficiency.   Jetson Orin: The company designed this platform for edge computers using generative AI, computer vision, and advanced robotics. Orin is NVIDIA's highest-performing option within the Jetson family.   3. Entering the customized chip market Seeking Alpha published an article about NVIDIA's potential competition in the customized chip market in early February. The article stated:  Nvidia's H100 and A100 chips act as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor for several vital customers. However, many tech companies have begun to develop their own internal chips. Nvidia aims to support these companies develop custom AI chips which that have gone to competitors such as Broadcom and Marvell Technology. A Reuters article states that the customized AI chip market size is $30 billion. The same article also said, ""Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com, Meta [Platforms] (META), Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, two sources familiar with the meetings said.""  Suppose NVIDIA manages to stave off the competition with these strategies. In that case, it may continue to achieve the revenue growth and margins investors want to see to justify its valuation. Brief First quarter FY 2025 overview and future expectations OpenAI and Microsoft introduced ChatGPT to the market in late November 2022. In 2023, the race among major cloud providers to introduce generative AI features created a heavy demand for powerful AI chips. NVIDIA was virtually the only AI chipmaker capable of providing the market with the types of chips needed to enable generative AI, and experts estimated that it grabbed over 90% of the market share for Data Center AI chips. The following table shows the company's rapid revenue rise in the Data Center segment due to AI chip sales. NVIDIA First Quarter FY 2025 Quarterly Revenue Trend First quarter FY 2025 Data Center revenue growth of 427% year-over-year drove total revenue growth of 262%. Some may say that AI and generative AI are all hypes. However, unlike the dot-com era, companies like NVIDIA that benefit from the proliferation of AI have actual bottom-line results. The following table summarizing the company's first quarter FY 2025 results shows that diluted earnings-per-share grew 629% from $0.82 in the first quarter of FY 2024 to $5.98 in FY 2025. CFO Commentary on First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results The following chart shows that gross, operating, and net profit margins have expanded significantly over the last year and a half. Data by YCharts The company produced cash flow from operations (""CFO"") to sales of 50.8% during the first quarter, meaning that NVIDIA converts every $1 in sales into $0.51. The chart below shows that the number is the highest level it has attained in its history. Data by YCharts CFO-to-Sales has a direct relationship and is one of the factors in how much FCF a company can produce. Every NVIDIA investor should ask themselves how much CFO-to-Sales the company can average in the long term as the market for AI chips matures, goes through a cyclical downturn, and competition begins to eat into margins. The number of years the company can sustain above 50% and how much lower the average CFO-to-Sales will eventually drop over the next ten years will directly impact valuation methods using free cash flow (""FCF""). In the first quarter, the company generated a trailing 12-month FCF of $39.33 billion. Data by YCharts NVIDIA ended the first quarter of FY 2025 with 31.44 billion in cash and short-term investments against $8.46 billion in long-term debt. The company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.23, indicating that most of its financing is from equity rather than debt. It has a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.22, meaning investors don't need to worry about NVIDIA's ability to pay off its debt. The company announced a ten-for-one stock split on June 7, 2024. Although stock splits don't affect a company's fundamentals or actual value, some studies show that companies that perform stock splits outperform the market over the next year. Zacks Investment Research estimates NVIDIA will report second-quarter earnings on August 28, 2024. The following table shows the company's guidance for the second quarter of FY 2025. NVIDIA First Quarter FY 2025 Earnings Release. NVIDIA's second quarter FY 2025 guidance for $28 billion exceeded analysts' estimates of $26.66 billion. If the company's revenue hits its second-quarter guidance, it would imply year-over-year revenue growth of 107%. If it hits the midpoint of the second quarter's GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) gross margin guidance, it would be up 470 basis points ('bps"") from the previous year's second quarter. All of that sounds great. However, it would represent a 360-bps sequential decline from the 78.4% GAAP gross margins the company recorded in the first quarter. This sequential decline may indicate that competition is already beginning to squeeze margins. Intel launched its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator in April 2024 with Dell Technologies (DELL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY)(OTCPK:LNVGF), and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) lined up as potential customers. An Intel press release claims, ""Intel√Ç¬Æ Gaudi√Ç¬Æ 3 AI accelerator, delivering 50% on average better inference and 40% on average better power efficiency than Nvidia H100 √¢¬Ä¬ì at a fraction of the cost."" Although NVIDIA's latest H200 and the upcoming Blackwell chip may be ahead of Gaudi 3, it provides competition in use cases where previously companies may have chosen H100 because it was the only AI chip available.  AMD released its MI300A and MI300X AI chips in December 2023. It unveiled its latest chip, MI325X, in early June 2024. AMD CEO Lisa Su claims that MI325X is better than NVIDIA's H200. The company plans to follow MI325X up with MI350 in 2025 and MI400 in 2026. Although AMD and Intel may have a challenging time catching up to NVIDIA's top chip performance any time soon, by providing the market with alternative AI chips, the era of AI chip demand outstripping supply may quickly end. NVIDIA could potentially lose pricing power, resulting in declining gross margins. Investors should monitor the company's gross margins moving forward. If gross margins trend downward too rapidly, it would likely sap much of the positive sentiment out of the stock.  Valuation NVIDIA trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 71.65, well above its sector median of 30.31. Seeking Alpha Quant rates the stock's overall valuation an F. The following table shows the company's forward P/E and analysts' EPS estimates. Generally, a good rule of thumb is that when a company's forward P/E matches analysts' EPS estimates in a corresponding fiscal year, consider it trading at fair value. The market may overvalue a stock when its forward P/E exceeds analysts' EPS estimates, while the market may undervalue a stock when a company's forward P/E is below analysts' EPS estimates.  According to the above rule, the market may undervalue this fiscal year's earnings growth rates based on FY 2025 EPS growth rates and forward P/E comparisons. As mind-blowing as the stock's rise this year has been, it may continue higher in the short term. However, the market may slightly overvalue NVIDIA based on FY 2026 comparisons. Seeking Alpha NVIDIA trades at a price-to-FCF of 81.28, above its five- and ten-year median. At this valuation, some consider this stock overvalued. Data by YCharts Let's do a reverse DCF on NVIDIA to see what the July 3 closing stock price implies about Nvidia's FCF growth over the next ten years. I will also estimate the stock's intrinsic value today.

If that analyst estimate proves true and NVIDIA can maintain a 49% FCF margin for the next ten years, the company will be unable to achieve an FCF growth of 24.4% over that period. Since NVIDIA will likely encounter much more competition over the next ten years than it does today in AI chips, it is unlikely to substantially increase or maintain an FCF margin of at least 49%. Let's assume it can achieve a still aggressive average FCF margin of 35% and grow revenue at 20% annually over the next ten years; the estimated intrinsic value is $65.85 or 48.66% below the current stock price. However, the stock will likely maintain a relatively high valuation over the next one to three years, since analysts expect revenue to grow at a CAGR of 44.89% over the next three years and FCF margins to remain around 49.5% over the same period. No one should be surprised if the stock stubbornly stays above most people's fair value estimates in the near term. However, after three years, the company's likelihood of maintaining the revenue growth and margins investors want to see to justify the current valuation begins to decrease. Why I maintain my hold rating Suppose you are a momentum investor only looking for short-term profits and willing to accept the risks. In that case, you may still be able to buy the stock and achieve potential gains over the next year due to the optimistic sentiment surrounding the company. However, the market overvalues the stock through several important valuation methods. If the company disappoints in the slightest, positive sentiment surrounding it could quickly evaporate. Therefore, most prudent investors would be better off not buying NVIDIA today. Buy-and-hold investors looking for long-term gains may have better places to invest their hard-earned dollars.  Investors with existing shares may hold on to them, as the stock can potentially go higher in the near term if the company meets high expectations for nearly triple-digit FY 2025 annual year over-year revenue and EPS growth with almost 50% FCF margins. Analysts also expect revenue to grow an additional 33% in FY 2026. The chip industry is cyclical and competitive. NVIDIA will likely eventually encounter difficulties due to a downcycle in the AI chip market or competitors taking market share and squeezing margins. How long its current good fortunes will last is unknowable. Therefore, if you hold the stock, monitor earnings results closely for signs that the company may encounter difficulties.

6F5MtwCWu1pYfTT,USA Today,bing,What are the best-looking pickup trucks in 2024?,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2024/07/08/pickup-capability-meets-cool-what-are-the-best-looking-trucks/74201340007/,2024-07-08 05:02,2024-07-08 05:12,RIVN,,"Of all the best-looking trucks, the ones we like most tend to be styled for purpose, whether that purpose is cutting through the air, getting to a campsite and looking like it belongs there, or simply trudging over trails. No truck looks better than when it‚Äôs in action. Here are our picks for the trucks that we like to behold doing what they were designed to do.¬†GMC Sierra AT4X¬†Modern full-size trucks are comically capable, and that includes when bounding down trails and carving new ruts. The GMC SIerra AT4X adds to that capability, and the AEV Edition pictured adds more on top, though not enough to seriously impair on-road driving. Leaving the factory with a host of off-road upgrades including a 2-inch lift and Multimatic dampers, the AEV Edition we tested stickers for $91,085. Those interested in building their own rig will balk, but there has rarely been an easier proposition to get into a proper custom off-road truck. Factory-built and factory-warrantied trucks are rarely this capable and rarely look this fit for purpose.¬†General Motors:GM brands will phase out CarPlay, Android AutoRivian R1T¬†¬†Built for those who may not be interested in standard full-size pickups, the almost-full-size all-electric Rivian R1T is made to stand out while still being practical. Sleeker and more aerodynamic than standard gas or diesel pickups, not to mention substantially capable on and off the road, the R1T keeps the traditional overall shape while ditching the traditional details. Despite still having a bed you can reach into from the side, Rivian says the R1T has a drag coefficient roughly 50 percent lower than a Ford F-150 Lightning electric truck, which contributes to running costs less than half that of a standard gasoline pickup. Efficiency doesn‚Äôt sell trucks like the Rivian‚Äôs Raptor-like off-road abilities and carlike on-road abilities, but we think it looks excellent.¬†Chevrolet Colorado ZR2¬†Full-size trucks define the mainstream, but the smaller midsize off-roaders can get into and out of places others may not, in addition to weighing less and looking just as cool. The Chevy Colorado ZR2 can be optioned to look like something out of a Tonka toy playset and is all the better for it. The best part is that this midsize off-road monarch rides better than the standard truck on the highway and almost carlike on the road, making it an excellent daily driver that can tear up an ORV park on a whim.¬†¬†Ford Maverick Tremor¬†The full-size truck faithful were certain the unibody, compact, hybrid Ford Maverick would flop on arrival, and then the order books broke under the demand. While the main reason for those bursting order books was the hybrid, the AWD-capable Ecoboost Maverick trucks garner their own praise with the Tremor package. Adding a little spice to the standard Maverick, the color keyholes on the wheels and bright badges match the spunky vibe of the truck‚Äôs colorful interior. The Tremor package is more than an appearance pack, with a lift, skidplates, 4WD lock and a rear locking drive unit among other upgrades. That‚Äôs more than enough to get the pluckiest Ford truck where it needs to go.¬†(Note: A 2023 model is pictured)Nissan Frontier Hardbody¬†The best-looking trucks are all built for a purpose, and this one‚Äôs purpose is inciting nostalgia. It performs this purpose well ‚Äî perhaps too well. The current Nissan Frontier is a fine, good-towing, hard-working truck, but its midsize competition outperforms it in about every metric while the ride and driving are much easier. Bringing some of the classic truck‚Äôs cool factor into the new vehicle was a good move, though we wish the new one drove as new as a 2024 Ranger or Colorado.¬†Jeep Gladiator¬†""Off-road sports car‚Äù was first used to describe the original Bronco, but the Jeep Gladiator might be the best modern example of such a thing. Terrifying to tow with, not immensely capable as a beast of burden, but extremely adept off-road, the Gladiator ignores practical concerns in favor of all the adventures people post on Instagram. While not ideal on the highway between overlanding jaunts, or on suburban roads away from the trail, the Gladiator earns its Jeep grill and removable doors when doing things worth posting about.¬†¬†GMC Canyon¬†Similar to the Truck of the Year-winning Chevy Colorado, the GMC Canyon is well sized and well proportioned. More mature and less aesthetically daring than the Colorado, the Canyon‚Äôs look suits its GMC brand while remaining far from boring. The interior design of the Canyon is also upscale, making it a great place to spend time.¬†Hyundai Santa Cruz¬†More crossover than pickup, the Hyundai Santa Cruz is less popular than the Maverick, sure, but its style is meant to appeal to a different audience. Instead of the slab sides, front and rear of a standard pickup, the Santa Cruz brings some streamlining, and even some minor curves. Despite being less bricky than its sole competitor, it is more capable in terms of towing, though its bed is smaller.¬†GMC Hummer EV¬†When it comes to the emergent class of EV supertrucks, the GMC Hummer EV forms a great counterpoint to both the sensibly forward-leaning R1T and the purposely offensive Cybertruck. While wild to a fault like the Tesla, it does so by being the biggest and baddest truck, rather than attempting to turn the truck concept into something else. The Hummer EV‚Äôs WTF mode and general driving manners contribute to its status as one of the ultimate means of wowing bystanders and passengers, despite being hilariously impractical as a means of transportation or work compared to the better-handling Rivian.Rivian R1T¬†:Are you unknowingly killing your tires?Best-looking trucks on sale in 2024¬†GMC Sierra AT4X¬†Rivian R1T¬†Chevrolet Colorado ZR2¬†Ford Maverick Tremor¬†Nissan Frontier Hardbody¬†Jeep Gladiator¬†¬†¬†GMC Canyon¬†¬†¬†¬†Hyundai Santa Cruz¬†¬†¬†GMC Hummer EV¬†Photos by MotorTrend and Manufacturer",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apple noted that the latest disagreement was related to the Epic Sweden AB Marketplace and has nothing to do with the Epic's Fortnite app which has already been approved, according to a report from Reuters. Epic said in post on X that it is using the same ""Install"" and ""In-app purchases"" naming conventions which is used across popular app stores on multiple platforms, and is following standard conventions for buttons in iOS apps.

Even though the affably named ""Oracle of Omaha"" is just as fallible as any other investor, he's managed to deliver an aggregate return in Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) that exceeds 4,940,000% since taking the reins in 1965.Extensive books have been written highlighting the blueprint Buffett and his team have used to pick out top-tier investments for more than a half-century. While you can read about these ""ingredients"" in greater detail, the bare-bones approach for Buffett has always involved focusing on brand-name businesses that offers clear-cut competitive advantages.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.Dividend stocks have paved the way to big gains for Berkshire HathawayHowever, there are other subtleties that have helped Berkshire Hathaway excel in the return column. One of these attributes, which tends to fly under the radar, is Warren Buffett's love for dividend stocks.Publicly traded companies that regularly dole out dividends to their shareholders are typically profitable on a recurring basis and have proven their ability to navigate challenging economic conditions. Moreover, income stocks have a lengthy track record of crushing non-payers in the return department.In 2023, the investment advisors at Hartford Funds released an extensive report, ""The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future,"" which examined the many ways dividend-paying companies have outperformed for investors. In particular, one data set, calculated in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks averaged an annual return of 9.17% over the last 50 years (1973-2023), and did so while being 6% less volatile than the benchmark S&P 500.Meanwhile, non-payers generated a more modest 4.27% annualized average return over the same span and were 18% more volatile than the S&P 500.The Oracle of Omaha understands that mature, dividend-paying businesses are just the type of companies that should increase in value over time. Not surprisingly, Berkshire Hathaway is on track to collect in the neighborhood of $6 billion in dividend income over the next 12 months.But not all dividend stocks are created equally. Among the 44-stock, $397 billion investment portfolio Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway, one holding is set to generate more than $1 billion in dividend income by itself over the next year.Many of Warren Buffett's core holdings are big-time dividend stocksAnother subtle but key facet of Berkshire Hathaway's ongoing success is its portfolio concentration. Despite holding stakes in 44 stocks, the lion's share of invested assets Buffett and his team oversee are put to work in just a handful of companies. Many of these core holdings are big-time dividend stocks.Story continuesFor example, Buffett's company has been holding shares of consumer staples titan Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) since 1988. As you can imagine, a 36-year holding period has left Berkshire with an exceptionally low (and highly favorable) cost basis in Coca-Cola of just $3.2475 per share. Given Coca-Cola's expected forward-year payout of $1.94 per share, Buffett's company is netting a roughly 60% yield on cost, relative to its initial investment of $1.3 billion. In dollars, Berkshire is collecting $776 million annually from its position in Coke.What's made Coca-Cola such a special investment is its geographic diversity and top-tier marketing efforts. With regard to the former, it operates in all but three countries globally (North Korea, Cuba, and Russia). This means it generates predictable operating cash flow in developed/established markets, and can move the organic growth needle by pushing into emerging market regions.As for its marketing, Coca-Cola can rely on more than a century of history to connect with its mature consumers. Meanwhile, it leans on digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to engage with its younger audience.Tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is another core holding for Berkshire Hathaway that's generating a boatload of annual dividend income. Although it hasn't raised its base annual payout for 62 consecutive years like Coca-Cola, Apple did recently increase its quarterly dividend by $0.01 per share to $0.25. Apple doling out $1 per share over 12 months will net Berkshire Hathaway north of $789 million in dividend income.Innovation explains why Apple accounts for 44% ($175 billion) of Berkshire's invested assets. Apple's iPhone has pretty consistently controlled a 50% or greater share of the domestic smartphone market since 5G-capable versions initially hit retail shelves in late 2020. CEO Tim Cook is also overseeing the steady evolution of Apple to a platform's company. A focus on subscription services should provide a boost to the company's operating margin over time.Image source: Getty Images.Say hello to the only stock putting over $1 billion in annual dividend income into Berkshire's coffersWhile Coca-Cola and Apple are income superstars for Warren Buffett's company, it's money-center behemoth Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) that sits atop the dividend income pecking order.Following the latest round of annual bank stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve, ""BofA,"" as Bank of America is commonly known, announced that it would be increasing its quarterly payout from $0.24 to $0.26 per share. Although a $0.02/share payout bump might not sound like much, it can make a sizable difference for Buffett's company, which holds more than 1 billion shares of BofA stock. A $1.04 per share dividend over the next 12 months from Bank of America will translate into roughly $1.074 billion in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway.The secret sauce that often allows bank stocks to dole out mammoth dividends is their cyclical ties.To state the obvious, recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic boom-and-bust cycle. However, recessions are historically short-lived, with only three contractions since the end of World War II lasting longer than a year. By comparison, a majority of economic expansions endure for multiple years. These non-linear cycles allow bank stocks like BofA to meaningfully expand their loan portfolios and reap the reward of interest income.Speaking of interest income, arguably no large bank has benefited more from the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy than Bank of America. The steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades is great news for the most interest-sensitive money-center bank on Wall Street. The longer the nation's central bank stands pat on interest rates, the more net-interest income Bank of America can collect.Although BofA probably isn't the first (or even 10th) name you'd think of when it comes to financial technology and digitization, the company's investments in technology have decisively paid off. Over time, a higher percentage of its consumer households are banking digitally and completing loan sales online or via mobile app. It's considerably cheaper for banks to interact with their customers online or via mobile app as opposed to in-person or over the phone. This digital push is making BofA a more efficient bank.Lastly, Bank of America has a rock-solid leader in Brian Moynihan. In the wake of the Great Recession, BofA was one of America's most-fined financial institutions. Since becoming Bank of America CEO in 2010, Moynihan has predominantly led his company with a conservative, risk-off approach that favors a robust capital-return program.When it comes to dividend income, Bank of America is in a tier of its own within the $397 billion investment portfolio overseen by Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway.Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Bank of America wasn‚Äôt one of them.

But Don't Panic If You Own It.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/08/six-months-2024-vanguard-esg-fund-trailed-sp-500/,2024-07-08 05:00,2024-07-08 05:15,META,,"If there's one thing you can count on when investing, it's that markets will vary -- sometimes by a little and sometimes by a shocking and swift amount. In the first half of 2024, the stock market rallied strongly, with the S&P 500 gaining 14.5%.However, some investors might have wanted an exchange-traded fund focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues as an alternative to the S&P. And so they bought the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV 0.67%). For these investors, their gain in the first half of the year was a little shy of the S&P -- roughly 13.5%. If you were one of them, here's why you shouldn't worry about the Vanguard ESG fund's laggard performance.Six months is not a long timeTheory tells the world that investors are rational, but anybody who has put their money on the line knows this isn't completely true. Over short periods of time, Wall Street can do some pretty illogical and shocking things.It is over the long term that investors tend to get things correct. Which is the No. 1 reason that six months of performance shouldn't worry you. In fact, even a year or two probably isn't long enough to start worrying when you are looking at a large and diversified exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF.ESGV data by YCharts.In the grand scheme of things, a percentage-point difference in performance over half a year just isn't that big a deal. The Vanguard ESG fund was up a lot, too, so it really had a good first half. Just not as good as the S&P 500 index.Meanwhile, if you go back to the inception of the ETF, it has actually managed to outperform the S&P 500 by a few percentage points. So, despite the near-term shortfall, it remains a very good proxy for U.S. stocks. And it provides socially conscious investors with a way to put their money where their beliefs are on the ESG front. That's a powerful combination.ESGV data by YCharts.Part of the problem right now, and the big reason for the Vanguard ESG fund's strong performance over the longer term, is its diversification. The S&P 500 owns roughly 500 stocks; the Vanguard ETF owns 1,431. While both are market-cap-weighted, there are implications to holding so many more securities.One sector to rule them all!There are two more ETFs that help highlight what is happening right now: the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP -0.04%) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK 0.31%). Taking the easy one first, the Technology Select ETF did even better than the S&P 500, which highlights the fact that the sector was an important part of the broader index's performance -- the tech sector makes up a third of the S&P 500.SPY data by YCharts.If you watch the markets, you know the big names, which include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. These are the top five stocks in the S&P 500, and all but one outperformed the broader index, some by a shocking margin.But there's more here than meets the eye. Because the index is market-cap weighted, these stocks had a disproportionate -- and positive -- impact on the S&P 500's return in the first half.SPY data by YCharts.You know that because the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF underperformed by such a wide margin, trailing the market-cap weighted S&P 500 by roughly 10 percentage points. When an equal-weight approach is used, each stock in the fund affects performance to the same degree. A small number of strong performers drove the market-cap weighted S&P higher, while the rest of the index dragged down the equal-weighted version of the same portfolio.That brings us back to the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF. It, too, is market-cap weighted and counts the very same technology stocks as its top five holdings (and the technology sector is an even larger 39% of its assets). But its portfolio is so much larger that the strength of the largest holdings gets diluted more than it does in the S&P 500, which has around 900 fewer stocks in it.Essentially, a small number of strong stocks had to pull so many more laggard stocks along in the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF portfolio that it just couldn't keep up with the S&P 500 index. Frankly, it's pretty impressive that the Vanguard ESG fund still managed to do as well as it did relative to the S&P 500.This bug is a feature of the Vanguard ESG fundSo here's the problem right now that investors in the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF have to wrap their heads around: Its diversification is why it is a good alternative to the S&P 500 over the long term. But the ETF's diversification is also why its performance might sometimes deviate from that of the S&P 500 index over short periods.The best thing to do here is probably to sit tight and accept the fact that sometimes, things aren't in perfect alignment because, over the short term, the stock market is driven by volatile emotions. Give it enough time, however, and investors will probably get the long-term story right.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
fw0cvmbeZUOSIMN,BBC,rss,What's the right punishment for 'too big to fail' Boeing?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p2jeg14r9o,2024-07-08 05:12,2024-07-08 05:27,BA,,"Boeing is one of the largest and most important companies in the United States. Arguably, it is too big to fail. But is it also too big to be held to account? The company is one of the world‚Äôs two main manufacturers of large commercial jets. It ranks among the top five US defence contractors. It employs more than 170,000 people globally, including 150,000 in the US, and generated revenues of nearly $78bn (¬£60bn) last year. It makes a vital contribution to the US economy. But its commitment to safety has repeatedly been called into question, most recently following an incident earlier this year in which a disused door fell off a Boeing 737 Max minutes after takeoff. Whistleblowers have since made a series of claims about alleged unsafe practices in Boeing‚Äôs factories, as well as in those of its main supplier, Spirit Aerosystems. Government prosecutors have now given their response. Boeing has agreed a deal under which it will plead guilty to an existing criminal charge, pay $243.6m and submit to independent monitoring for three years.  With critics calling for a fundamental change in Boeing‚Äôs corporate culture, the deal is likely to be highly controversial. That is largely because safety failings at the company are far from new ‚Äì while attempts to address them appear to have been unsuccessful. Five years ago, Boeing was under siege: 346 people had been killed in two near-identical accidents involving its brand new 737 Max, just months apart. It emerged that corners had been cut during the aircraft‚Äôs design, and regulators had been deceived. After the first crash, the aircraft had been allowed to keep flying despite a known problem. Boeing was accused of putting profits ahead of passenger safety. In 2021, it agreed to pay a $2.5bn settlement, but avoided prosecution on a criminal fraud conspiracy charge. The Department of Justice (DoJ) has now concluded that Boeing broke the terms of that settlement ‚Äì by not implementing and enforcing a suitable compliance and ethics programme ‚Äì allowing the company to be prosecuted now under the original criminal charge. But family members of many of those killed think the new deal is far too lenient. They had been calling for a much steeper penalty. In a letter sent to prosecutors last month, their lawyer Paul Cassell called for a fine of more than $24bn in recognition of what he described as ‚Äúthe deadliest corporate crime in US history‚Äù. He also called for individuals to face prosecution, including the former chief executive, Dennis Muilenberg. Lawmakers in Washington have also expressed concerns that Boeing is too important to be held fully accountable. At a hearing in April, Republican Senator Ron Johnson said he feared regulators were concerned about hurting a company so critical to the US economy. ""I‚Äôll go back to the reality of the fact that we all want Boeing to succeed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to think that there are conditions in these planes that should really force regulators to ground these planes - what that would do to our economy, what that would do to people‚Äôs lives. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving the lack of accountability,‚Äù he added. Analysts said there was little doubt Boeing‚Äôs status as a major contractor to the US military would have been a key factor in deciding what action to take against the company. In 2022 alone, it racked up more than $14bn worth of contracts with the Department of Defense. ""That may matter the most regarding not the direct terms of the plea, but rather the negotiations over possible debarment or suspension from contracting,"" said Prof Brandon Garrett of Duke University School of Law, who tracks corporate prosecutions. There is also Boeing‚Äôs position in the commercial aviation market to consider. The aerospace giant currently has orders for more than 6,000 jets, representing years of production. Its great rival Airbus has an even larger backlog, and has been struggling to produce enough planes to meet demand. Put simply, the market currently needs Boeing if airlines are to obtain the planes they need. But in the future the company will also have to be in good shape if it is to see off the threat from an emerging rival. Chinese state-backed manufacturer Comac is now producing the C919 passenger jet, a potential rival to the 737 Max and Airbus A320 neo. It began commercial flights in May. Although its order book is tiny compared to those of the two established giants, in the longer term it could profit from any weakness at the American giant. There is also potential for Brazil‚Äôs Embraer, a successful manufacturer of smaller regional airlines, to move into the space occupied by Boeing and Airbus. ""Boeing's too big to fail, but it's not too big to be mediocre,"" says Ronald Epstein, managing director at Bank of America, who follows the firm. ""We all want a healthy Boeing,"" he adds. ""Having a Boeing that's on the wrong track is bad for everybody."" The crises have already taken a heavy toll on the company, which has lost money every year since 2019, a sum totalling more than $30bn. All of this may explain why the DoJ has not imposed steeper penalties on Boeing. Nevertheless, the company has admitted to a serious crime. That in itself is a major development. The question now is whether the DoJ has done enough to deter future wrongdoing. Copyright 2024 BBC.

IFURwj5vobLMguz,Seeking Alpha,bing,"Uber: New Growth Engines Emerge, Big Buybacks Ongoing",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702860-uber-new-growth-engines-emerge-big-buybacks-ongoing,2024-07-08 05:37,2024-07-08 05:45,UBER,,"MOZCO Mateusz Szymanski Uber (NYSE:UBER) had been among the top-performing Industrials-sector stocks in the initial months following its inclusion into the S&P 500. Shares topped out in the low $80s, though, as the shine came off the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) as the first quarter drew to a close. The last three-plus months have featured relative strength, primarily out of the Information Technology and Communication Services sectors. But Uber fits those molds to an extent. What's more, if the company pounces on the opportunity to earn increased revenue from advertising, then there could be a new growth story to be told in the quarters ahead.  With a reasonable valuation given the earnings trajectory and a generally healthy technical backdrop, I am upgrading shares from a hold to a buy. Since I last analyzed the stock, UBER has indeed underperformed the S&P 500 and a significant 24% drawdown took place from March through late May. During that stretch, the company missed on its Q1 earnings report, which also emboldened the bears. Industrials Lose Relative Strength, UBER Shares Pare YTD Gains Stockcharts.com The $149 billion market cap company issued a mixed set of quarterly results two months ago. First-quarter operating EPS of -$0.32 was a significant miss, but adjusted EBITDA of $1.38 billion was above the Wall Street consensus estimate of $1.32 billion. Revenue of $10.13 billion, up 15% from year-ago levels, was a modest $40 million beat.  Gross Bookings grew 20% from Q1 2023 to $37.7 billion, a 21% jump on a constant-currency basis, while its Mobility Gross Bookings metrics jumped 25% year-on-year. The management offered Q2 guidance √¢¬Ä¬ì Gross Bookings as of early May were seen in the $38.75 billion to $40.25 billion range, which was slightly below expectations, but adjusted EBITDA for the current quarter was above estimates, in the $1.45 billion to $1.53 billion range.  There were challenges in its Latin America segment, but that was the only significant blemish. Free cash flow verified at $1.36 billion in Q1, while its EBITDA margin improved to 9.9%. Shares fell 6% in the session that followed, perhaps driven also in part by higher competition from Lyft. Q1 Summary and Q2 Guidance   Seeking Alpha Longer-term, I was encouraged to hear that Uber has included more advertising in its app as the ride-sharing company tests new ways of driving high-margin sales. More promotional space in the app could frustrate customers, though, so there are risks with the endeavor. But Uber expects more than $1 billion in ad revenue this year, so if we see continued growth in that project, then analysts√¢¬Ä¬ô forecasts could be increased in the quarters ahead. This is a key area to get color on in the upcoming earnings report. We'll see if the firm can garner some positive PR and social media exposure during the upcoming Olympic Games. Furthermore, at Uber's Go-Get 2024 event in May, the company unveiled new products, including Uber Shuttle, scheduled UberX shared rides, discounted Uber One student pricing, and a partnership with Costco. Before the Q1 report, Uber announced a large $7 billion stock buyback program in yet another bullish move by its executive team. Key risks for the company include lower margins should the macroeconomic situation deteriorate. That would also likely result in slower user adoption and usage, along with softer revenue gains. Competition from full self-driving services is a longer-term risk. As always, regulatory and political changes could adversely affect Uber.  On earnings, analysts at BofA see operating EPS rising 30% this year with stronger growth in the out year. By 2026, Uber could do more than $3 in non-GAAP EPS. The current Seeking Alpha consensus figures show slightly less sanguine profits in the years ahead, but also a consistently high 15% to 16% revenue growth rate through 2026.  No dividends are expected to be paid out from this high-growth new entrant in the S&P 500, but the firm is solidly free cash flow positive while its valuation has retreated amid a fall in the stock price and as earnings have jumped from previous periods. Uber: Earnings, Valuation, Free Cash Flow Yield Forecasts BofA Global Research Taking a PEG ratio approach, if we assume a normalized EPS growth rate of 25%, below the 41% consensus EPS growth percentage for 2026 but significantly above the S&P 500√¢¬Ä¬ôs long-term EPS growth rate, and assume a sector median PEG ratio of 1.65x, then that implied a P/E in the low 40s. Assuming $2.10 of consensus EPS in FY 2025, we arrive at an intrinsic value target in the mid-$80s. Last time, I described that the PEG ratio was not expensive on the stock. Also, a 3.44x price-to-sales ratio is by no means egregious given Uber√¢¬Ä¬ôs healthy growth trajectory. UBER: A Compelling PEG Ratio Seeking Alpha Compared to its peers, Uber has a weak valuation rating, but as I detailed earlier, the company√¢¬Ä¬ôs rapid growth rate justifies a high non-GAAP forward P/E. Moreover, profitability trends are favorable with the high-growth transportation stock, given where free cash flow is and where it√¢¬Ä¬ôs headed.  Share-price momentum has softened in the last few months, but the broader trend, which I will give color to later, remains higher. Finally, the sellside turned decisively bearish on Uber in the past 90 days, evidenced by a high 29 EPS downgrades compared with just four upgrades. Competitor Analysis Seeking Alpha Looking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon shows an unconfirmed Q2, 2024 earnings date of Tuesday, August 6 BMO. No other volatility catalysts are seen on the calendar. Corporate Event Risk Calendar Wall Street Horizon The Technical Take With a reasonable valuation and a pullback in the stock, I am encouraged by the chart today. Notice in the graph below that shares held key support in the mid-$60s during the latest pullback. The previous high from early 2021 was a spot I noted last December. I expected some consolidation at that level, but a longer-term target of about $80 was definitely in play.  Amid those favorable technicals, UBER indeed rallied, briefly exceeding my technical target. Today, a needed correction has taken place. With a rising long-term 200-day moving average around the point of polarity in the mid-$60s, long here with a stop under $60 makes sense. There was a bullish RSI momentum divergence in late May as well. Overall, the trend remains positive despite the corrective move in Q2. I see support at $65 while the all-time high is resistance. UBER: Shares Hold Key Support, Rising 200dma Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line  I have a buy rating on Uber stock. I see the valuation as somewhat attractive given the growth profile and continued earnings advance in the past few quarters. With a robust technical trend, momentum is on the side of the bulls in my view.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Could He Be Right?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/08/1-hedge-fund-manager-predicts-nvidia-will-be-worth/,2024-07-08 05:49,2024-07-08 06:01,NVDA,,"Wall Street remains generally bullish about Nvidia (NVDA -1.91%). The stock has skyrocketed more than 150% year to date and now boasts a market cap of nearly $3.2 trillion. Even after this huge gain, 21 of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG this month still recommend Nvidia as a buy or strong buy.But that optimism pales in comparison to what one hedge fund manager expects. EMJ Capital's Eric Jackson predicts Nvidia will be worth $6 trillion by the end of 2024. Could he be right?A bold prediction or a boneheaded one?Jackson thinks Nvidia's share price will reach $250 by year-end. That's nearly twice the current share price. And it would put Nvidia's market cap at roughly $6.15 trillion, making the chipmaker the biggest company in the world by far. This prediction is either bold or boneheaded, depending on your perspective. The biggest Nvidia bull on Wall Street right now is Rosenblatt Securities' Hans Mosesmann, who set a 12-month price target for the stock of $200. Mosesmann is definitely an outlier. The average price target for Nvidia is a little below the current share price, according to LSEG. Jackson's view makes Wall Street, including Mosesmann, look downright pessimistic. Perhaps the most audacious aspect of Jackson's prediction (other than the short amount of time he expects it will take for Nvidia to nearly double again) is his primary rationale. He thinks the main reason the stock will continue to soar is that it's still cheap.Aswath Damodaran, an NYU finance professor known as the ""Dean of Valuation"" because of his expertise in valuing stocks, would beg to differ. In February, he crunched the numbers on Nvidia and estimated its fair value at $680 per share. Since the company conducted a 10-for-1 stock split in June, this estimate translates to a fair value of $68 per share now -- nearly 50% below its current share price. How it could happenLet's suppose, though, that Jackson's prediction is right. How could Nvidia reach a market cap of more than $6 trillion by the end of this year? The hedge fund manager told CNBC in a recent interview: I think what's going to happen in the second half of the year, as people start to see how well the Blackwell chips are selling, how good the gross margins are on those, and start thinking about what's to come with the Rubin chips around the corner, I think we'll start to see that euphoria reflected in a lofty go-forward price-earnings multiple, and if that happens, this thing can go to [a] $6 trillion market cap.Let's unpack Jackson's statement. First, he expects exceptionally strong sales for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) based on its new Blackwell architecture. This seems to be a reasonable expectation to me. Nvidia has already indicated that the demand for these new Blackwell GPUs is greater than supply, a situation that could continue well into 2025. Second, he thinks investors will be impressed with the Blackwell GPU's gross margins. Again, I suspect Jackson's view is realistic. Blackwell's total cost of ownership is 25 times lower than its Hopper GPUs with significantly lower energy consumption. I won't be surprised if the price Nvidia charges for the chips gives it a great gross margin.Third, Jackson anticipates that the success of the Blackwell platform will cause many investors to be excited about the further growth prospects that Nvidia's next innovation -- the Rubin architecture -- will offer. I suspect he could be right on this too.Fourth -- and, in my view, most important -- Jackson foresees investors experiencing euphoria that drives Nvidia stock to lofty levels. Is that farfetched? Not at all.Possible but not probableJackson's reasoning for his prediction that Nvidia's market cap could top $6 trillion by the end of 2024 makes sense to me. However, it calls for greater euphoria than I think is likely.Perhaps investors' enthusiasm about Blackwell and its successor Rubin platform will cause Nvidia stock to fly much higher than it already has. But while I think it's possible that Nvidia could be worth $6 trillion by year-end, I don't think it's probable.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

I1KQ7dyNBexnQT2,Yahoo Finance Canada,google,Tesla investors to urge judge to reject record $7 billion legal fee in Musk pay case,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-investors-urge-judge-reject-100304066.html,2024-07-08 06:03,2024-07-08 06:11,TSLA,,"By Tom HalsWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Tesla shareholders will appear in court on Monday to argue that an unprecedented request for more than $7 billion in attorneys' fees to be paid by the company is ""outlandish,"" the latest twist in a legal showdown over Musk's $56 billion pay package.The record fee request was made by investor Richard Tornetta on behalf of three law firms that represented him, including Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. Tornetta owned nine shares of Tesla when he sued over Musk's pay package of stock options in 2018, a legal battle he ultimately won in January when the package was voided.The fee equals around $7.2 billion at Tesla's Friday's stock price and amounts to a rate of roughly $370,000 for every hour worked by the 37 lawyers, associates and paralegals, some of whom normally bill as little as $275 an hour, according to court documents submitted Tornetta's lawyers.ADVERTISEMENT""The legal fees appear exceedingly disproportionate and outlandish,"" Nathan Chiu, a Tesla shareholder from New Jersey, wrote to Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in March, according to a court filing.Chiu, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and more than 8,000 Tesla stockholders have flooded the Delaware Chancery Court with some 1,500 letters and objections over the fee, according to court documents.A hearing scheduled for Monday was moved from McCormick's usual courtroom to the largest in the building to accommodate the 47 attorneys from 19 law firms appearing in the case, as well potential stockholders.Tornetta's lawyers argue they deserve the fee as a cut of the benefit they say they conveyed to Tesla when a judge voided Musk's pay package, which returned to Tesla around 266 million shares reserved for the stock options. That stock would be worth about $67 billion at Friday's price of $251.82 per share.Tornetta's attorneys said it is the largest judgment ever awarded by an American court, excluding punitive damages. They argued they should receive a fee equal to 11% of that judgment, a percentage that is arguably conservative by Delaware legal precedent. They asked to be paid in the form of 29 million Tesla shares.Story continuesRECORD FEE REQUESTWhile federal courts tend to lower the fee as a percentage of judgments or settlements as they get bigger, Delaware courts have gone the opposite way, awarding a larger percentage as an incentive for attorneys to push for a bigger recovery.Tornetta's legal team said they would have been justified asking for up to 33% of the value of Musk's pay package.The fee request vastly outstrips the current record fee in shareholder litigation of $688 million in an Enron class action, according to Stanford Law School.The Musk case took a dramatic turn when Tesla shareholders in June voted to ratify Musk's pay, which Tesla has argued corrected the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick identified in her ruling.The company argues that Musk's pay package has been restored and that Tornetta's legal victory has been transformed into a loss. As a result, the case conveyed no benefit to Tesla and the shareholder lawyers should receive as little as $13.6 million, Tesla said.Some of the shareholders who have opposed the request wrote form letters to the judge, but a few have hired attorneys to file formal objections to the fee, including Amy Steffens, a pilot, and Kurt Panouses, an attorney who specializes in representing lottery winners.McCormick may take weeks or months to rule. The Delaware Supreme Court is currently considering a $267 million fee request in a shareholder class action involving Dell Technologies and that decision could provide fee guidance.(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Aurora Ellis)",,True,A legal dispute has arisen over Tesla CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package.

And if people want to come, you‚Äôre more than welcome,‚Äô‚Äù she says.¬†Start by asking friends, family members and coworkers to join you. Have them bring a friend along. Spread the word on social media or by word of mouth. Bring your book club up in conversations. But if you want to keep it intimate, don‚Äôt be afraid to start small, Montesano says: ‚ÄúA group of two people is still a book club.""¬†2. Know your purposeAfter you get a good group together, define your purpose as a club. Do you want to make new friends? Learn about a new topic? Bring people with different beliefs together? Strengthen a pre-existing friend or professional group?3. Set the ground rulesAs you build membership up, make sure everyone has the same expectations. Is your club an open invite? Or do you want to create a small, intimate atmosphere?¬†Though Open Book Club is public, Montesano typically caps the events at 30 people. Any more than that, she feels, would make it ""hard to open up and be vulnerable.‚Äù4. Get organized: Choose a book and when to meetThere‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all solution ‚Äì every book club is different. You can rotate who picks the book or do a group poll system. Bookclubs found that clubs that conduct polls to choose books have higher engagement, Ford says.Deciding when to meet tends to be the biggest roadblock, Ford says. That‚Äôs why she created Bookclubs ‚Äì to take the burden off of members. The platform includes polling, calendar scheduling, digital shelving, reading reminders and embedded video software.¬†5. Host your first meetingIf you‚Äôre meeting in person, host your book club somewhere with plenty of seating options so people can get comfy and discuss.¬†Montesano hosts hers at a coworking space in New York. She has members contribute money toward food and wine ‚Äúto make it feel like you‚Äôre hanging out with friends and breaking bread.‚Äù She always keeps plenty of water on hand for all the talking.¬†You can opt for a free-for-all discussion or prepare questions as a jumping-off point.¬†Montesano has members break up into small groups and rotate after 30 minutes to discuss with someone new since her club is bigger.Good questions can help drive lively discussion. Successful questions have prompted members about fan theories or characters, Montesano says. Sometimes she‚Äôll look at reviews and ask members if they agree or disagree with what critics said about the book.6. Schedule your next meetingAfter the meeting wraps is the perfect time to capitalize on that energy and schedule the next one.‚ÄúMinimizing the time between the end of the meeting and scheduling your next meeting is another key to success,‚Äù Ford says.How often should a book club meet?Every club is different, and you may have to find your footing before you find the best flow for your club. Clubs that meet with a certain ‚Äúcadence and frequency,‚Äù say, monthly, are more likely to stay together, Bookclubs data found.Because Montesano‚Äôs Open Book Club is both a social event and a space for discussing books, she hosts sessions two to three times a month. But your club might decide once a month or once every other month is more feasible.¬†It‚Äôs important to gauge how quickly your members can read the book selection and be realistic.What is a good book club book?Any genre makes for a good book club pick, says Ford. It just depends on what your members like to read. The most popular genre on Bookclubs is literary fiction, followed by mystery and thriller.¬†Here are the top 10 most popular book club books on Bookclubs:""Lessons in Chemistry"" by Bonnie Garmus""Where the Crawdads Sing"" by Delia Owens""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"" by Taylor Jenkins Reid""The Midnight Library"" by Matt Haig""The Silent Patient"" by Alex Michaelides""Verity"" by Colleen Hoover""The Vanishing Half"" by Britt Bennett""Remarkably Bright Creatures"" by Shelby Van Pelt""Educated"" by Tara Westover""Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow"" by Gabrielle ZevinMontesano says she gravitates toward books that are relatable to members. That could mean the main character is of a similar age or lives in the same state as you.‚ÄúIt provides such good fodder ... as an icebreaker question: ‚ÄòHave you been to any of the places that are mentioned in the book‚Äô or ‚ÄòDo you think the book would have been different if it was set in another city?‚Äô‚ÄùYou‚Äôll want to pick a book that‚Äôs a conversation starter. A book that‚Äôs universally loved is not necessarily a good book club pick, Montesano says. Dislike and disagreement are grounds for a good book club debate.

He's aiming for taekwondo gold,https://apnews.com/article/2024-olympics-paris-taekwondo-nickolas-43c050405d30aaefa1a04a5bc8d2e599,2024-07-08 06:00,2024-07-08 06:18,ARM,,"PARIS (AP) ‚Äî A malformed vertebra couldn‚Äôt stop him. Neither could heart surgery, or a change of weight category that everyone thought was a big mistake.Breaking his arm in the buildup to the Paris Games was just a minor distraction, too.It seems there‚Äôs almost nothing that could derail CJ Nickolas‚Äô quest for an Olympic medal.At 22, Nickolas is the highest-ranked U.S. athlete in taekwondo, No. 2 in the world in the men‚Äôs 80-kilogram (176-pound) class. A silver medalist at last year‚Äôs world championships, he will be leading the four-member U.S. taekwondo team in Paris.His silver at the worlds was the first for the U.S. men‚Äôs team since 2009, and the Californian now hopes he‚Äôll become the first American man in the sport to stand on the Olympic podium in 12 years.‚ÄúGoing in there and just forcing it and forcing and forcing, imposing yourself on the other person for the entire day,‚Äù Nickolas told The Associated Press of his competitive approach. ‚ÄúIf I can do that, I don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs anyone that can beat me.‚ÄùNickolas‚Äô Olympic journey started when he was just three. His mother Denise ‚Äî a nurse whom he cites as his main inspiration alongside his adoptive father ‚Äî took him to a taekwondo club.

They‚Äôre a billion-dollar business with political overtones.Breakdance will make it‚Äôs debut as an Olympic sport in Paris.. Here‚Äôs what else will be different at this year‚Äôs games.Follow all of AP‚Äôs coverage of the Summer Games.Denise fell in love with Edward Givans, who was the owner of the taekwondo school. They didn‚Äôt stay married for long, but Givans carried on coaching Nickolas, who still calls him his dad. They both instilled in him a taste for hard work and dedication.‚ÄúEverybody around me has taught me how to work hard every which way I turn,‚Äù Nickolas said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bunch of hard workers and people who embrace the struggle rather than shy away from it or fall into it. And it‚Äôs a lot of success that we see come from it.‚ÄùDenise said her son is ‚Äúone of the most, if not the most, driven people I know.‚Äù‚ÄúI just supported his dream and let him lead the way,‚Äù she told the AP. Nickolas‚Äô career really took off after he decided four years ago to move up in weight categories. Nickolas stands 6-feet-2 (1.88 meters) but many thought he was too small for the move.A career-changing moveContinuing at the 68-kilogram (150-pound) category would‚Äôve been the more conventional route to an Olympic medal.‚ÄúEveryone was like, ‚ÄòWhat are you doing?‚Äô You‚Äôre too small. You were fine in 68 kilos, just buckle down and make the weight,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really care about what everybody was saying because the place that I was in, with the sport, I had fallen out of love.‚ÄùNickolas had plateaued and had lost the joy of competing, mainly because of what he had to go through mentally and physically to cut weight.Supported by his coach, Nickolas made the career-changing decision to move up to the heavier division. ‚ÄúI was a little bit nervous but at that point, it was like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have to focus on making weight. I don‚Äôt have to focus on anything but getting better as an athlete and fighting,‚Äô‚Äù Nickolas recalled. ‚ÄúIt was super freeing, and I found my love for the sport again. It absolutely was the best decision that I probably made in my adult life.‚ÄùThen there were other problems to solve.Health issuesA bone defect in his neck is a condition that, from a doctor‚Äôs perspective, should prevent Nickolas from being a professional fighter.‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs muscle in that place now. So it‚Äôs strong,‚Äù Nickolas said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs an Achilles‚Äô heel, or something like that. If I was to take a really bad hit in that area then it, it wouldn‚Äôt be pretty at all. But any hit in this back area is not great.‚ÄùThere was also the complication of a heart condition, discovered in 2020.‚ÄúThat was a big year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI moved up weight divisions, got heart surgery.‚ÄùNickolas had terrible migraines and struggled to breathe before medical tests revealed a hole in his heart, a condition dating from his birth that had aggravated. It wasn‚Äôt life-threatening, but certainly required quick action.Rather than hinder his athletic development, it has helped.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really wheeze anymore ... and I can last longer in the ring. I don‚Äôt get migraines like that anymore,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt worked out for me very, very well.‚ÄùThe list of setbacks didn‚Äôt end there, though.In May, as he prepared for the Olympics at the Pan American championships in Brazil, Nickolas fractured his left forearm during the final. With adrenaline masking the pain, he kept on fighting. And won.A couple of days later, he was back on the mat at a tournament he needed to attend to ensure a good ranking at the Olympics. The pain was worse, and his arm was sore and throbbing.‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt make a fist so we had to tape my hand closed so that I could hold a fist and tighten my arm ‚Äî I had to do that for four fights,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I got the job done. A little checkpoint going into the Games.‚ÄùNow comes the final hurdle, in the person of Simone Alessio, the reigning world champion who beat him the final at the worlds. Alessio is Nickolas‚Äô nemesis, an Italian athlete standing at 6-feet-6 (1.98-meters).‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm in a short distance with him, my face is on his chest,‚Äù Nickolas said. ‚ÄúThe hardest fight that I have in the division is the guys that are taller than me, you know, the David and Goliath situation,‚Äù he said. But ‚ÄúThe last time I fought him, it was tight. So it was essentially down to some technical stuff that he beat me, that‚Äôs how close we are at this point.‚Äù___AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

FOX Business exclusively viewed an advance copy of the report, which estimated that as of December 2023, the pandemic's total economic cost in the U.S. topped $18 trillion after taking into account several ways in which the pandemic affected the economy.That figure includes more than $8.6 trillion caused by excess deaths; more than $1.825 trillion in lost income; $6 trillion due to chronic conditions such as ""long COVID""; and mental health losses of $1 trillion and educational losses of $435 billion pushed the total above $18 trillion.

250EUfXRyTnFglr,Seeking Alpha,google,"Palantir: Transforming International Relations With AI, But Overvalued (NYSE:PLTR)",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702867-palantir-transforming-international-relations-with-ai-but-overvalued-downgrade,2024-07-08 06:13,2024-07-08 06:23,PLTR,,"Bussarin Rinchumrus/iStock via Getty Images In my last thesis on Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), I described the company as a long-term Buy. While I think that this is true and that the company's long-term growth trajectory remains largely intact, with significant growth coming from the vital utilization of Palantir's AI offerings for Western defense, I think that the stock is now overvalued. I mentioned this in my previous thesis, but since the stock has gained 20% in roughly three months since my last analysis, I think a rating downgrade is warranted. Operational Analysis In my opinion, Palantir is arguably going to be the leader in AI-assisted warfare. I am not personally bullish about warfare companies often, partly because it is not my field of expertise and partly because I view diplomacy as always favorable when possible. However, I believe that the utilization of AI for defense is vital during a time when global international conflict is looming. Niall Ferguson, in an Intelligence Squared interview 4 weeks ago available online, said we are currently in a cold war period. I think this is true, and I think that Palantir's Western government defense AI offerings are largely conducive to the balance of power being kept. In my opinion, it is advantageous for the U.S. to continue to strengthen itself in defense in core areas while curbing the federal budget in other areas. In my opinion, AI-assisted technologies like those offered by Palantir, which it has a considerable moat in, are likely to take a much greater focus in Western defense budgets moving forward. This has been made evident recently by the $480M U.S. defense contract for an AI system prototype called Maven. In many respects, I think that the nature of warfare is changing, and I wonder whether moving forward, it will be as physical as it has been historically. I think Palantir has recognized this early and has positioned itself for long-term growth under these catalysts. Part of how the battlefield and international relations are evolving if it is to be less about physical conflict is that it is more about psychology. Palantir is very closed about the workings of its defense programs, because it is under strict NDA agreements. While Palantir's tools support the shift toward a more information-centric form of future warfare, it is still speculative at this stage how this will evolve. Thus far, much of what has been developed by Palantir in the defense world and in its commercial contracts is software for efficiency in decision-making and information management. However, from my analysis and research, including watching interviews with why Peter Thiel and CEO Alex Karp founded the company, a big driving force is to transform international security to be more subtle and sophisticated. I think management is on to something very special here, and I think the company is actually at the nascent stages of these profound shifts in international defense. Palantir stock is likely to grow extremely well if it continues to consolidate its moat in these areas, and I think the company is also extremely sophisticated in its operational structure, with around 45% of its revenue from commercial contracts and 55% from government contracts. This allows the company to be agile to the shifting nature of international security, especially if the demands and necessity for high levels of government defense become less acute over the long term, which is a potential outcome that I see from the growing reliance on information and AI in international defense and more globalized world order in the long-term future. This brings me nicely to Palantir's role in commercial cybersecurity, which I think is likely to grow for the company over the long term. The company has developed an AI-enabled solution for discovering, understanding, and remediating cyber vulnerabilities. It calls this its Enterprise Vulnerability Management ('EVM') System. It also uses Palantir Gotham, which is primarily known for defense and intelligence applications, for commercial cybersecurity. Furthermore, Palantir Foundry offers cybersecurity capabilities for commercial clients, including AI-led threat detection. At the moment, the government market for Palantir is bigger than its commercial market, but I think this is going to change over the long term. In essence, its strength in both areas acts as an ongoing hedge against the change between peace and wartime economies. In my estimation, the current cold war period, which is intensifying, is likely to bolster the company's government revenues over the next decade, but I am hopeful that as AI, robotics, and automation capabilities scale, driven by the West, the deflationary effects will support the dollar as the global reserve currency and re-establish the West as the uni-polar leader of the world order, re-establishing a peacetime economy. At this time, Palantir is well-positioned to navigate a future strategic redirection toward its commercial contracts to continue to deliver revenue growth, and I think Palantir is one of the foundational companies that is crucial in strengthening the West into a leadership position again and out of concerns of international multipolarity. Financial & Valuation Analysis The company is operating slowly and steadily with all of the ingredients for long-term success on a pure financial front. Its positive free cash flow generation earlier than net income was largely due to high levels of SBC. The real good news is that the company is GAAP net income positive as of fiscal 2023. This resulted in massive enthusiasm from the market, as we can see in my second chart. Data by YChartsData by YCharts I see this time and time again, the market loves to buy shares when net income gets reported. However, in my opinion, the real secret to investing in many non-profitable growth companies is to look for free cash flow generation before net income generation. If free cash flow positivity has already been achieved, it is very possible to buy before the herd, as would been the case with Palantir if investors bought in 2022 when the valuation was favorable. Data by YCharts However, now, it is arguably too late to buy PLTR shares to achieve a competitive long-term price CAGR. Even in my last thesis, the likelihood of a long-term market-beating CAGR was relatively low. After gaining 20% in three months since that analysis, I see it highly unlikely the company will beat the market over 10 years now, primarily based on its valuation. Data by YCharts Based on analyst estimates, I don't think it is unreasonable for the company to achieve a revenue CAGR of 15% over the next 10 years. However, I do not think that the current price-to-sales ratio of around 25 is sustainable. There are very few companies like Palantir, but one has to argue why it deserves a price-to-sales ratio that is so much higher than even other technology companies that are renowned for rich valuations, like Tesla (TSLA) and Shopify (SHOP) and even other software companies more similar to Palantir like Salesforce (CRM): Data by YCharts My question, which I am still trying to ascertain, is what is the market expecting from Palantir, which makes a price-to-sales ratio of 25 reasonable? From my research thus far, it isn't reasonable, but I would be interested from readers in the comments if they have ideas of why it could sustain such a high P/S ratio, given its revenue growth is only likely to be circa 15% annually over the next 10 years. In my opinion, over the long term, a P/S ratio of around half that, 12.5, might be realistic for the company to have in 10 years' time. But for the purposes of this analysis and relative conservatism related to its historical valuation multiples (19 as a 5Y average for P/S), if the company has a P/S ratio of 15 this time in 2034, with a 15% revenue CAGR, the stock price would be $65, implying a price CAGR of 9% from the current stock price of $27.23, based on TTM revenue per share of $1.07. Risk Analysis There are very few direct competitors to Palantir, but notably, there are growing threats in international government programs. China is rapidly developing AI capabilities for military applications through its Military-Civil Fusion strategy. This integrates civilian research and commercial sectors with military development, potentially rivaling Palantir and Western interests. Russia has also been heavily investing in AI for military purposes, as outlined in its National AI Strategy. On the Western front, Palantir is not the only company with advanced capabilities developing. While it is the most advanced, Israel's Unit 8200, an elite intelligence unit, has been at the forefront of developing advanced AI and cybersecurity technologies. Many startups founded by Unit 8200 are now competing in the global defense AI market. In addition, the European Defence Fund has multiple AI projects for defense applications. It is important for Palantir to focus on integration with Western counterparts during this time, in my opinion, as its capabilities scale and if it can offer the most advanced capabilities in AI-led international security. Furthermore, India, the highest growth nation in the world at this time based on GDP, has launched the Defence AI Project to develop AI-powered defense applications. It is not improbable that India will develop highly advanced forms of international security and commercial security systems similar to Palantir, given the country's heavy focus on AI and consulting services already. As such, Palantir needs to focus on dominance in the field to continue to help Western powers lead internationally, in my opinion. I also think there are considerable risks with Palantir developing AI for defense in the future, which prove uncontrollable as the capabilities of the technologies scale. Defense is arguably the most sensitive use of AI, and a high level of risk mitigation and ethics is required in the development, maintenance, and strategy of future implemented systems. I think if there are bad instances where defense AI has a widespread mistaken negative effect on general civilian populations domestically and/or internationally, market sentiment for Palantir could be severely depleted, perhaps even over the long term. In my opinion, this is the largest risk for PLTR shareholders. Conclusion  Palantir is actively involved in this current cold war period in international relations, where weaponized AI is becoming increasingly prevalent as a security measure and a threat of attack and defense. In my opinion, there is a long-term likelihood of AI rising as a leading threat in information and psychological warfare akin to nuclear weapons, but much more subtle. I think Palantir is in the nascent stages of developing this, and while it might be viewed as negative for those who do not like to invest in military companies due to ethical reasons, I think that the evidence mounts that the West is likely to continue to mount in strength to position itself in unipolarity in the world order. A large catalyst that I believe will support this is the region's lead in AI, which some believe is about a 10-year lead against China. I think this lead should be capitalized on, and I think that Palantir can help to support this. By initiating further emphasis on AI defense in the West, I believe international peace can remain. This is why I am long-term bullish about PLTR, despite present valuation risks, which means I am not initiating a position at present.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today‚Äôs tech titans do it in plain sight, on social media.Last week Elon Musk threw some thunderbolts at Bill Gates, predicting he will be ‚Äúobliterated‚Äù.Musk‚Äôs personal feud with the Microsoft founder has been simmering for a couple of years, ever since he discovered Gates had put a significant amount of money into shorting Tesla stock: betting the price would fall.He has pursued the grievance with typical vigour ‚Äì posting an unflattering picture of a photo of Gates‚Äô with a prominent middle aged paunch, comparing him to the pregnant man emoji. It‚Äôs all very Trumpian.Gates isn‚Äôt alone in his scepticism. An army of short-sellers, who call themselves Tesla Q, have even created their own derivatives: two dedicated investment funds are listed on Nasdaq for Tesla shorters.The sums involved when tech titans have impulsive manic phases are unimaginable. For example, when Musk decided he didn‚Äôt like Twitter‚Äôs board of directors, bought the company and took it private, it cost him the equivalent to the annual GDP of Portugal or New Zealand: some $250bn (¬£195bn).A public feud is also the perfect distraction from the challenges facing important parts of Musk‚Äôs empire, which are very real. Each time fresh doubts arise, Musk pops up and doubles down on a wild or improbable claim. Musk‚Äôs rocket business, SpaceX, is in great health, but some of his others are not.Musk boasted last week that he would triumph over the short-sellers ‚Äúonce Tesla fully solves autonomy [safe self-driving cars] and has Optimus in volume production‚Äù. Sadly, this only increased the mockery.Optimus is Tesla‚Äôs humanoid bipedal robot, another business inspired by 1950s boys‚Äô science fiction ‚Äì specifically the movie Forbidden Planet ‚Äì like his resuable rockets, which return gently to Earth.¬†Musk envisages Optimus replacing manual labour in difficult and dangerous situations, and as domestic help. Perhaps every home will have a Robbie the Robot one day.The problem is, it just isn‚Äôt very impressive. The Japanese have been showing off robo-humans at trade shows for decades: they nod, bow and often fall off stage. Musk‚Äôs is little different.‚ÄúInvestors are not excited about Optimus‚Äù, observed Gene Munster, market guru and analyst at Deep Water Management.¬† Earlier this year Musk admitted that footage of an Optimus robot neatly folding a T-shirt had been faked. ‚ÄúOptimus cannot do this yet‚Äù.Important note: Optimus cannot yet do this autonomously, but certainly will be able to do this fully autonomously and in an arbitrary environment (won't require a fixed table with box that has only one shirt)‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 15, 2024Tesla already had enough problems on its plate with imported, heavily subsidised Chinese EVs flooding the market, undercutting them significantly. It‚Äôs been slashing prices, but struggles to lower its costs against deeply subsidised rivals.Story continuesBut it‚Äôs ‚Äúsolving autonomy‚Äù that really has the short-sellers licking their chops. Success would mean that a Tesla car or truck is able to drive safely with the passenger paying no attention to the road ‚Äì Level 5 on the industry scale of capability.Nobody believes it‚Äôs imminent. After spending more than $100bn in the past decade, the industry has been unable to come close: Level 3 is the best we have today. Safety is the key.‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt feel safe putting your 96 year old grandma in the backseat with nobody behind the wheel, it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving‚Äù, explains EW Niedermeyer, author of the Tesla book Ludicrous.Scientist Filip Piekniewski points out that computer perception ‚Äì his speciality ‚Äì is nowhere near good enough. Manufacturers just won‚Äôt admit it, and those left in the field have been ‚Äúautonowashing‚Äù, exaggerating the capabilities of the technology.This has in turn has inevitably led to drivers turning their attention away from the road, causing accidents. Tesla engineers have testified that the company‚Äôs marketing claims cannot be justified. The US Department of Justice is reportedly considering suing Tesla for wire fraud, for misleading investors and consumers.But the real problem with Musk‚Äôs vision of robo-cars is that even if all the technical obstacles are one day overcome, nobody really needs it. We can joke about armchairs that wheel us to the pub and back, and futurists and urban utopians can dream of the end of car-ownership and on-demand robo-taxis. But who cares?The driver is really the cheapest part of any taxi business, and employers know they can just import some newer, cheaper labour if wages go up. Not that taxis are a profitable businesses anyway: just ask Uber. After a decade, it‚Äôs only just broken even.Musk says autonomous vehicles are ‚Äúa $5 to 7 trillion market cap situation‚Äù, while autonomous robots will one day generate $25 trillion. As one Twitter critic pointed out: that‚Äôs one third of global GDP.Elon thinks 1/ autonomous transport is a $5-7 trillion market cap situation, and 2/ Optimus is a ~$25 trillion market cap situation for $TSLA pic.twitter.com/1Y1gtjtAuX‚Äî Teslaconomics (@Teslaconomics) June 13, 2024Back on planet Earth, the gap between these boasts and reality grows ever wider. Tesla‚Äôs first truck was years late, and has been recalled four times since deliveries began in November.Ultimately, however, it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter. Musk inhabits a rarified plane where businesses just don‚Äôt fail. Other denizens include Boeing, for example: it appears that the company will be propped up no matter what happens, so that Airbus doesn‚Äôt take the civil aviation market and the US military retains another supplier.Can you imagine Microsoft being stripped of Government contracts, even after its excruciating security failures? Where are businesses supposed to go?Chinese manufacturers rarely go bust: they‚Äôre too important to the PRC. The normal rules of the market have been suspended: Musk is just the most colourful figure in this fantasy land.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

A measure of hedging costs for JPMorgan and Wells Fargo shares is hovering near its lowest level since 2021, while protection for Citigroup is below its one-year average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The biggest US banks have sailed through the Federal Reserve‚Äôs annual stress test, and many have increased their payouts to shareholders as the industry awaits a watered-down version of a proposal for stricter capital rules. Results in late June from Jefferies Financial Group Inc. showed momentum building for investment banking, adding to optimism for a recovery after elevated interest rates throttled the pace of dealmaking.For Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are the preferred names among large-cap banks into the earnings. She sees JPMorgan accelerating share repurchases over the coming quarters and potential upside in Wells Fargo‚Äôs outlook for net interest income, while Citigroup‚Äôs views on buybacks and revenue are likely to be a focus.‚ÄúExpect both earnings and forward commentary to add further confirmation that we are still in the early stages of a multi-year global capital markets recovery off of multi-decade lows versus nominal GDP,‚Äù Graseck wrote in a note, adding that banks don‚Äôt have ‚Äúheroic assumptions‚Äù for loan growth this year.When it comes to volatility following the results, options are pricing in stock moves more or less in line with what was seen after past reports. The market is currently expecting the biggest swings from Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley ‚Äî 3.4% gains or drops that match their average move following the last eight earnings.The expectations for muted swings in bank stocks come as the broader market has been generally serene, with the Cboe Volatility Index recording its lowest average reading since 2017 in the first half. What‚Äôs more, July is known to be particularly calm for equities: In the past 15 years, the VIX has had its lowest average daily reading during this month.Story continuesAlso read: Stock-Market Volatility Is Entering the Seasonal Super-SnoozeFollowing the last expiration, the number of options outstanding on JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo has slumped, another indication that positioning remains light before the results. The open interest on JPMorgan‚Äôs options is near a five-year low, while for Citigroup it hit the lowest since the start of 2022 and for Wells Fargo it‚Äôs near its lowest since January.‚ÄúThe set up looks very good for the banks over the next 18 months,‚Äù RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy wrote in a note. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates and banks‚Äô funding costs could start to fall, while the US economic expansion will help boost loan growth.

T8xuIZObjt9Aunj,Seeking Alpha,google,IBM Is Poised To Move Higher (Technical Analysis),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702884-ibm-is-poised-to-move-higher,2024-07-08 06:33,2024-07-08 06:44,IBM,,"JHVEPhoto International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an information technology giant that most people are familiar with. The New York-based information technology consulting company yields 3.8% and appears ready to make its next move higher in this bull market. This article will outline my reasoning for being optimistic about IBM advancing in price. My technical analysis approach uses price action, momentum, volume, and relative strength to outline my investment thesis. I will also identify a stop loss and an initial price target. Chart 1 √¢¬Ä¬ì IBM weekly with moving averages, momentum, volume, and relative strength   www.stockcharts.com When I analyze a stock, I use the weekly time frame and I like to use moving averages to determine the substance from the noise, so to speak. Prices fluctuate as we know and moving averages can help us distinguish between random price fluctuations and the real trend. In Chart 1 we see price and three moving averages. The 10-week exponential moving average [EMA], along with the 20-week EMA, and the 30-week EMA. Big gains in the market are often preceded by price being above all three moving averages and all three moving averages are trending higher. Notice IBM from June 2023, to March 2024. Over this time, IBM gained over 40% and price never closed below all three moving averages. Those are the type of market moves I aim to capture using my market analysis. Since the top at $197.22 in March 2024, IBM has declined. It pulled back to $161.02 in April 2024 and closed below all three moving averages. The moving averages themselves rolled over and the 10-week EMA and 20-week EMA started to decline, and then the 10-week EMA crossed below the 20-week EMA in April, indicating the potential for a further downside move in IBM. Instead of further declining, IBM just consolidated in the $160 to $170 price range and now IBM has moved higher. I see two bullish price action indications on Chart 1. The first is that price is now above all three moving averages again. The second bullish price action indication I see is that the 10-week EMA is above the 20-week EMA, which is above the 30-week EMA. The moving averages are in what I call bullish alignment. This set up often precedes a large price advance and was present in the June 2023 to March 2024 price advance. I am bullish about the current price action set up. Another consideration I use when analyzing a stock to buy is momentum. I want to buy stocks that have bullish momentum. To determine this, I use the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) shown in pane 1 of Chart 1. The PPO is easy to understand. When the black PPO line is above the red signal line then short-term momentum is bullish. When the black PPO line is below the red signal line then short-term momentum is bearish. That is the condition today, short-term bearish. Long-term bullish momentum is measured by the location of the black PPO line in the chart. If the black PPO line is above zero or the centerline of the chart, then long-term momentum is bullish. This is the condition we have today. I say long term, because looking at PPO, you can see that the black PPO line does not often go above or below zero or the centerline of the chart. The black PPO line usually stays above or below for months on end. Right now, we have bearish short-term momentum combined with bullish long-term momentum. On the plus side, you can also see that the black PPO line is starting to curl upwards, meaning that a short-term momentum change may take place soon to the bullish side. Momentum leans bullish to me when I analyze the PPO. I like to see strong volume to the upside for stocks that I want to buy. Strong volume numbers on weeks when the stock rises indicate institutional investors are buying the stock. Retail investors don√¢¬Ä¬ôt have enough money to buy enough shares to move the price up or down. However, institutional investors do, and they leave footprints, which are shown by the big volume bars in the third pane of Chart 1. Three weeks ago, when IBM closed back above all three moving averages, it did so on higher-than-average volume, which is an indication of institutional money buying shares in IBM. They will only do that if they think that IBM is undervalued and should be trading at a higher price. The volume picture leans bullish to me. Relative strength is a consideration for me when I buy shares of stock. I want to own stocks that are outperforming the SP 500 index. The relative strength indicator in the bottom pane of Chart 1 allows me to analyze how IBM is performing compared to the SP 500 index. The black line is a ratio of the price of IBM to the price of the SP 500 index. When the black line is rising then IBM is outperforming the SP 500 index. You notice that IBM outperformed the general market during the June 2023 to March 2024 advance. When the black line is falling, that shows that IBM is underperforming the general market. You can see that clearly from the March 2024 high to present day. Analyzing the current condition, it looks like relative strength has flattened out over the last several weeks, meaning that IBM has performed about the same as the general market. The relative strength of IBM to the general market is still bullish from the June 2023 low to present day, as the relative strength line is higher today than it was back in June 2023. Now, the relative strength line is at best neutral when I analyze IBM. If I take a position in IBM, I like to consider where I will place my stop loss in case my analysis proves incorrect. I would rather take a small loss and move on to another opportunity, than sit with a stock and suffer a major loss. My first stop loss point would be a close below the 30-week EMA at the $169 level. Looking at Chart 1, you can see that when the price closes below the three moving averages that can mean further losses ahead. Notice February 2022 and January 2023. In those two months, price closed below the three moving averages and then declined from there. It doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt always work out that way, as the recent area of price consolidation shows, but I√¢¬Ä¬ôd rather be safe than sorry. Now that I have a stop loss identified, where might price go from here? Since October 2022, IBM has moved higher and made a series of higher highs and higher lows. Each pullback has led to a new high. My technical analysis suggests that this could happen again. Price could therefore exceed the previous high of $197 made in March 2024. If so, that is a gain of 21 points or almost 12% from the current price. With a stop loss of $169 or 7 points from the current price, this opportunity sports a 1:3 risk to reward ratio, which I see as a good opportunity.  In summary, price is now above all three moving averages and all three moving averages are in bullish alignment. Long-term momentum is bullish, and the black PPO line is curling upwards, indicating that short-term momentum may soon become bullish. Volume shows recent bullish activity. Relative strength is not much better than neutral. This trade opportunity offers a reasonable 1:3 risk to reward ratio.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cq0ZU9yXiZY1Pss,Yahoo Finance,bing,Omdia: MediaTek outgrowing Qualcomm Snapdragon in the 5G smartphone market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omdia-mediatek-outgrowing-qualcomm-snapdragon-103000864.html,2024-07-08 06:38,2024-07-08 06:49,AAPL,,"LONDON, July 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --¬†5G smartphones equipped with MediaTek chipsets experienced robust growth of 53%, increasing to 53.0 million in 1Q24 from 34.7 million in 1Q23, according to the latest Omdia Smartphone Model Market Tracker. In contrast, Snapdragon-powered devices remained relatively stable, with shipments changing minimally from 47.2 million units in 1Q23 to 48.3 million in 1Q24.MediaTek's market share in 5G smartphones rose to 29.2% in 1Q24, up from 22.8% in 1Q23, while Qualcomm Snapdragon's share decreased from 31.2% to 26.5% over the same period. Figure 1 illustrates MediaTek leading followed by Apple and Snapdragon.5G smartphone market by chipset makerOther¬†chipset manufacturers, such as Exynos, Google, Kirin and UniSoC collectively account for 17% of shipments. This share has increased in the past year driven by Kirin's growth, particularly with the Huawei Mate 60 Pro and Nova 12 series. Following HiSilicon's announcement to cease Kirin chipset production from September 15, 2020, amid ongoing trade tensions between Huawei and the United States, the Kirin 9000s chipset concluded its production in August 2023.MediaTek's expansion over Snapdragon in the 5G smartphone market is largely attributed to the increasing availability of phones priced under $250 equipped with 5G chipsets ‚Äì a segment dominated by MediaTek. According to figure 2, shipments of 5G smartphones below $250 surged by 62%, from 38.7 million in 1Q23 to 62.8 million in 1Q24. This has particularly favored MediaTek, as it is the preferred choice in this price range for 5G phones, while Snapdragon leads in mid-range 5G phones and Apple dominates the premium segment.5G smartphone shipments by price tierOver the past three years, as most chipset makers shifted from producing 4G to 5G chipsets, UniSoC has capitalized on the opportunity to increase its share in the declining 4G market. UniSoC is now MediaTek's primary competitor in this sector. During this period, Apple, Exynos and Snapdragon underwent significant transitions in their chipset portfolios, focusing heavily on 5G technology. For instance, Exynos reduced its reliance on 4G chipsets from 77% of smartphone shipments in 1Q21 to just 1% in 1Q24. In comparison, MediaTek continues to use 4G chipsets for over 50% of its shipments.Aaron West, Senior Analyst in Omdia's Smartphone group explains: ""The smartphone chipset industry is primarily shaped by two major trends: the widespread adoption of 5G and the expanding low-end segment. As 5G technology becomes more affordable and is integrated into smartphones priced below $250, MediaTek stands to benefit the most. Conversely, on-device AI capabilities are becoming increasingly important to smartphone OEMs, with Snapdragon emerging as a key innovator and preferred choice for premium devices.""Story continuesABOUT OMDIAOmdia, part of Informa Tech, is a technology research and advisory group.

TayPNrLnTstBXsO,Yahoo Finance,bing,The Year Is Half Over: 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Second Half,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/half-over-3-dividend-stocks-100700772.html,2024-07-08 06:30,2024-07-08 06:49,MSFT,,"The stock market had a strong first half of the year. The S&P 500 rallied 14.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index surged 17%.However, while the first half was strong for the broader market, it wasn't quite so good for dividend stocks. The Dow Jones US Dividend 100 Index (which tracks the 100 top dividend stocks) only rose about 2%. Because of that, many high-quality dividend stocks look like relatively attractive investments right now.Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as great dividend stocks to buy now. Here's why they could deliver strong total returns in the second half of the year and beyond.A 7.5% yield is hard to complain aboutReuben Gregg Brewer (Enbridge): The portfolio backing Enbridge's 7.5% dividend yield is changing in 2024. That's because the company is buying three regulated natural gas utilities from Dominion Energy.These deals are expected to be completed by the end of the year and will increase the Enbridge's exposure to natural gas utilities from 12% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)¬†to 22%. That's a big change, helping to reduce the company's reliance on oil pipelines, which will fall from 57% of EBITDA to 50%.This is a key long-term focus for Enbridge as it looks to shift its business along with the world as demand for cleaner energy sources increases. There are negatives for Enbridge with this deal, which is requiring it to take on some debt. However, Enbridge has reliable cash flows from its fee-based, regulated, and contract-driven income streams and should be able to handle the additional leverage.The benefit of the acquisitions is that Enbridge will have more regulated utility assets, which have fairly reliable capital investment and return profiles. So, basically, it is baking in more slow and steady growth for the future.And that brings up the stock's impressive 29 consecutive annual dividend increases. The yield is likely to make up the lion's share of an investor's total return, but slow and steady dividend growth could easily round the total return up to 10%.Right now could be the time to lock in this high-yield stock since the acquisitions that have Wall Street worried should be in the past by the end of 2024. After that point, Mr. Market may take a more positive view of the future and the stock.Waiting for the market to wake upMatt DiLallo (Brookfield Infrastructure): Shares of Brookfield Infrastructure meandered along during the first half of 2024. The global infrastructure giant slipped about 4%, vastly trailing the S&P 500's first-half surge. That underperformance makes no sense whatsoever.Story continuesFor starters, the company is growing briskly. Its funds from operations (FFO) rose 11% in the first quarter, powered by a strong 7% organic growth rate and the impact of over $2 billion of new investments. Those catalysts should continue fueling healthy growth this year. Brookfield expects its FFO per share to rise by more than 10% in 2024.That would push its FFO up to around $3.25 per share. With its stock price recently around $34, Brookfield Infrastructure trades at about 10.5 times forward earnings. That's about half the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the S&P 500 at 22.2. This dirt-cheap valuation is a big reason why Brookfield Infrastructure offers such a high dividend yield (nearly 5%).The stock trades as if Brookfield won't grow very fast in the future. That couldn't be farther from the truth. The company expects to continue delivering double-digit FFO per share growth. Several catalysts power that view.CEO Sam Pollock noted: ""Our sector-leading organic growth is highly correlated to the two most significant trends of this decade, namely, decarbonization and AI/digitalization. The investments we are currently making in our transmission, residential decarbonization, semiconductor and data center businesses will fuel our growth for many years.""The company's growth drivers should give it the fuel to increase its high-yielding dividend by 5% to 9% per year. Add that income stream to its earnings growth and valuation upside potential, and Brookfield could generate robust total returns in the coming years.High-powered growth aheadNeha Chamaria (Brookfield Renewable): Shares of Brookfield Renewable (Brookfield Infrastructure's renewable-focused sibling) -- both units of the limited partnership and shares of the corporation -- are barely in the green so far this year. The renewable energy giant, however, is steadily growing its cash flows and dividends and has a sensible growth plan in place that could generate strong returns for patient shareholders in the long term.Brookfield Renewable delivered a record first quarter in May, growing its FFO by 8% year over year. With its project pipeline also on track, the company expects to bring new renewable capacity worth nearly 7 gigawatts (GW) online this year.That aside, Brookfield Renewable also sells mature assets opportunistically and expects to generate roughly $1.3 billion in proceeds from asset sales this year. At the end of the quarter, the company had nearly $4.4 billion of liquidity to invest in growth.Brookfield Renewable also signed a first-of-its-kind agreement with tech behemoth Microsoft in Q1 to deliver 10.5 GW of renewable energy capacity between 2026 and 2030. The deal could open up similar opportunities for the company in the years to come.Given the backdrop, Brookfield Renewable looks like a great stock to buy for the second half of 2024 and beyond. Management is, in fact, confident of growing FFO per unit by 10% this year, which should get the ball rolling for the coming years.For now, Brookfield Renewable foresees 10% annual FFO growth through 2028, backed by its development pipeline and margin improvement, among other things. With the stock also yielding 5% and targeting annual dividend growth of 5% to 9%, Brookfield Renewable looks like one of those dividend stocks you might even want to double up on now.Should you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?Before you buy stock in Enbridge, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the¬†10 best stocks for investors to buy now‚Ä¶ and Enbridge wasn‚Äôt one of them.

stAzkMJq5ZA5HIJ,Seeking Alpha,google,WGMI: Revisiting My Bullish Thesis On The Bitcoin Miners,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702890-wgmi-revisiting-my-bullish-thesis-on-the-bitcoin-miners,2024-07-08 06:47,2024-07-08 06:54,BTC,,"Sibani Das Ironically enough, on Halloween 2023, I ended a long hiatus from SA and posted my thesis on Bitcoin miners, with special attention focused on the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (NASDAQ:WGMI). At the time of the article, WGMI was trading at under $10 a share with little to no momentum. Fortunately, those who were brave enough to take the plunge have been rewarded with an outsized gain of over 100%, with the potential for more to come. A few notable recent events, in my view, warrant a reexamination of the thesis to determine if the opportunity has passed or if there are more gains to come. Bitcoin The initial foray into the miners was based on the premise that the miners would serve as a beta play on the continued higher move of the underlying asset, Bitcoin (BTC-USD). I viewed the BTC miners in a similar vein to the gold mining industry. The theory held that when the gold (GLD) ran, the miners witnessed by the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) would outpace the underlying move in the commodity as miner profitability would explode higher. The BTC/ WGMI thesis has held up remarkably well. On October 31st, BTC traded at $33k, and WGMI traded at roughly $10. BTC is up roughly 75%, while WGMI is up over 120% in the comparable period. An interesting anomaly has opened, with BTC peaking in mid-March, yet the gains in WGMI have accelerated since. Halving Cycle BTC underwent its pre-determined halving every 210k blocks on April 19, 2024. The halving vent is notable for two main reasons. For the miners, it is a period of expected pain as the block reward for mining is cut in half. The reduction in block rewards sets off a chain reaction where miners are required to upgrade equipment or face the risk of obsolescence as block rewards fail to cover the cost of energy. At the time of the halving, the BTC network hash rate was 650 Ehs, a notable peak. The current hash rate of 546 Ehs is a drop of 16%, and more hash rates could come offline as the current hash reward approaches 4.5 cents per Terahash. We do not see revenue and earnings explode higher as miners face a tough go post-halving. We have a change in the thesis as a new element that can boost the miner's revenue has been uncovered. AI Winner The miners and, by extension, WGMI are well positioned to profit from the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure. Some may postulate this is a bridge too far, yet I can assure you it is not. What does a BTC miner do? They identify cheap, underutilized power sources, typically in remote areas, to build a data center to set up their machines to mine Bitcoin. Miners typically avoid major city centers as the cost of electricity is prohibitive. For example, my home electricity rate is thirteen cents a kWh. If I plug in a 100Ths machine, I can expect to earn $4.55 in BTC rewards (if I can stand the noise and do not get fined for noise ordinance). The cost of mining is $9.55, leaving me with a net loss every day. To make a go of it, a miner would need to procure long-term electricity contracts at 2-3 cents a kilowatt hour. Coincidentally, the AI build-out requires the same conditions as those witnessed by the hyperscalers, who need to acquire abundant energy quickly. We witnessed the opening gambit of a multi-year bull market in energy, with Amazon (AMZN) acquiring a nuclear power plant to power a data center currently under construction. AMZN dropped $650 million for the plant, who's to say another competitor with a deep pocket will not step forth and acquire a publicly traded BTC miner? The probable path of least resistance for the miners is to partner with the hyperscalers and offer to manage some of their AI workload at the existing BTC mining facilities. The customer can forgo the cost of building the facility from scratch. In contrast, the miners can now have a new source of high-margin revenue that will offset some of the volatility of the BTC mining industry. An example is the recently announced deal by HUT8 (HUT), a BTC mining veteran. I believe the AI buildout and the recently announced deals are what arrested the anticipated slide in WGMI due to the recent peak in BTC prices. WGMI Holdings In my view, the optimal setup is to purchase the index instead of one of two names in the industry. The AI deals signed by some of the smaller cap miners have come out of the blue, whereas the largest player by market cap, Marathon Digital (MARA), is down for the year as the AI potential seems to have passed them by. WGMI has astutely under-indexed them, with MARA the seventh-largest holding. I suggest readers familiarize themselves with the current top holdings vs. my last article to see the dynamism of the industry. Risk Factors WGMI earnings are currently tied to the vagaries of the BTC cycle. With the recent drop in the price of BTC due to Mt Gox repayments, there are no guarantees the miners will continue to outperform. In addition, an investor is buying into an ETF that is red-hot and potentially overbought. A nasty pullback can occur at any time, inflicting psychological pain and potential losses. In addition, the AI buildout may hit speed bumps, with little guarantee that additional hosting deals will be signed. Failure to ink additional deals may have a hard-to-predict material adverse effect on the industry.  With a sharp eye on the potential and a keen awareness of the risk involved, I thank all for reading and good luck!!!",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to being one of the largest publicly traded companies on the planet, it is a business that continues to grow at a rapid pace. Over its lifetime, it has made many investors wealthy. And in the long run, it's likely this trend will continue. It has been this mindset, combined with how shares have been priced, that has led me to be generally bullish about the firm. The last article that I wrote about the company was published in the middle of March of this year. At that time, I ended up reaffirming my 'buy' rating on the stock. Since then, shares have seen upside of 5.8%. Unfortunately, this does trail, ever so slightly, the 6.1% increase seen by the S&P 500 over the same window of time. But from the first time that I upgraded the company to a 'buy' from a 'hold' back in October of 2023, shares are up a whopping 49.8% compared to the 27.4% rise seen by the broader market. Despite this move higher, the firm continues to show drastic signs of improvement. And that is enough to justify further upside from here. Some great momentum Even though Amazon is, at its core, an e-commerce business, one of the most important parts of the firm is actually its cloud operation. This is known as AWS. In an article that I wrote not long ago regarding Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), I talked more about this industry and the potential that it has. Even though this is a large market, rapid growth moving forward should result in excellent potential for the top few businesses in this space. And the fact of the matter is that, right now, Amazon and rival firm Microsoft (MSFT) are the industry leaders. Author - SEC EDGAR Data Despite fierce competition, Amazon continues to see strong upside. Since I last wrote about the firm, we have only had one additional quarter worth of information come out. That covers the first quarter of 2024. For that time, revenue generated by AWS came in at $25.04 billion. That's 17.2% above the $21.35 billion the segment generated one year earlier. This increase in revenue was driven largely by a rise in customer usage. In fact, things are going so well that this growth was in spite of the fact that pricing changes, driven by a shift to long-term customer contracts, had a negative impact on operations. Author - SEC EDGAR Data As impressive as this revenue growth is, it's actually the growth in segment profits that investors should be paying attention to. Profits jumped from $5.12 billion in the first quarter of last year to $9.42 billion the same time this year. This improvement was driven not only by the higher revenue, but also because of decreased payroll and related expenses. The picture would have been even better had it not been for increased spending on technology infrastructure that the company is making an order to improve operations and to drive further growth. Author - SEC EDGAR Data This growth on the bottom line for AWS is clearly not a one-time blip on the radar. The fact of the matter is that management has been successful in growing margins for some time now. In the first quarter of 2022, profit margins for the segment came in at 24.3%. Since then, we have seen growth to a profit margin of 37.6%. There was a time, back in the first quarter of 2022, when margins were nearly as high. But that seems to have been a temporary thing. The cost-cutting initiatives that management has been focused on make it seem as though we will not see a repeat of the decline that was seen back then. Author - SEC EDGAR Data I would make the case that AWS is the gem in the crown that is Amazon. But it's not the only reason I am bullish about the business. The fact of the matter is that other parts of the company are expanding nicely also. Its North American business, for instance, continues to expand. Revenue in the first quarter of 2024 came in at $86.34 billion. That's 12.3% above the $76.88 billion generated one year earlier. According to management, this was largely because of increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, as well as stronger advertising sales and increased subscription services. Management's continued emphasis on fast shipping options also helps considerably. In the not-too-distant past, the e-commerce part of the company was a true money loser. But that has since ceased to be the case. In the first quarter of 2023, the North American operations generated segment profits of $898 million. That number has ballooned to $4.98 billion as of the end of the most recent quarter. This growth is in spite of continued investments in shipping and fulfillment costs, as well as greater technology and infrastructure spending. The fact of the matter is that, as the company continues to grow, its cost structure becomes more efficient. This is the famous flywheel that Jeff Bezos envisioned many years ago. And after all this time, it is finally bearing fruit. The biggest weak spot for the company has always been its international business. The fact that this part of the company is considerably smaller than its North American operations explains all of this. A smaller operation means weaker economies of scale. But the good news is that even on this front we are seeing some improvements. In the most recent quarter, revenue internationally came in at $31.94 billion. That's a hair above the $29.12 billion generated one year earlier. This growth, and the economies of scale that comes with it, has been helpful in pushing the firm from generating a segment loss of $1.25 billion to generating a segment profit of $903 million. What we are seeing across the company is margin expansion. And that is an excellent catalyst for upside for investors. At some point in time, the growth prospects for Amazon will dwindle. But I don't think this will occur anytime soon. We live in a growing world where goods and services continue to be purchased in increasing quantities online. This is driven in part by globalization, but also by domestic changes. The data that's available right now suggests that this growth trend is nowhere near done. On the B2C (business to consumer) front, global e-commerce revenue is expected to expand by roughly 11.2% per annum, climbing from $3.64 trillion last year to $5.56 trillion in 2027. International Trade Administration This does indicate a slower growth rate than the 14.4% annualized growth anticipated from 2017 through 2027 as a whole. But you can't expect rapid growth to occur forever. On the B2B (business to business) side of things, growth is expected to be quite robust as well. In 2023, it was estimated to be worth $24.45 trillion. And by 2026, it should expand to $36.16 trillion. That's an annualized increase of 13.9%. It's unclear exactly how much of this Amazon we'll be able to capture, considering that about 80% of this market will be in the Asia Pacific region of the world. However, Latin America will also be a major growth area, as will the Middle East. Obviously, none of this factors in the growth associated with its cloud operations, which is a topic I have covered before. In short, growth potential for the business as a whole looks promising. International Trade Administration If we annualized the results that we have seen so far for Amazon, then we would expect adjusted operating cash flow this year of about $145.81 billion. Meanwhile, EBITDA would come in at about $145.19 billion. For those worried that recent growth was a one-time thing, management did say that they expect operating income in the second quarter of this year to be between $10 billion and $14 billion. That's well above the $7.7 billion reported at the same time last year. This will be based on revenue growth of between 7% and 11% on a year-over-year basis. With numbers like these, I don't worry about my estimates for this year as a whole being off by all that much. Author - SEC EDGAR Data With these figures, I was able to value the company on a forward basis, as shown in the chart above. You can also see how the company is valued relative to figures from 2023. On a forward basis, specifically, shares look quite attractively priced. This is especially true when you factor in the growth the company is seeing and the fact that it has net cash as opposed to net debt in the amount of $27.44 billion on its books. Takeaway  The way I see things, the future for Amazon and its investors is almost certainly going to be bright. Absent something significantly negative coming out of the woodwork, I suspect further upside moving forward. This will be based on growing revenue, profits, and cash flows. Due to these factors, I have no problem keeping the company rated a 'buy' at this time, even after seeing such rapid upside since I first rated it a 'buy' back in October of last year.

ÔªøIt will pay up to $487 million in fines ‚Äî a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of crash victims wanted the aircraft maker to pay. The families of victims of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max oppose the deal, the department said.                The agreement stipulates that Boeing will have to operate under the oversight of an independent monitor, to be chosen by the government, for a period of three years. But that oversight and the fine did not satisfy the families of victims, according to their attorney.                ‚ÄúThis sweetheart deal fails to recognize that because of Boeing‚Äôs conspiracy, 346 people died,‚Äù said a statement from Paul Cassell, a law professor of University of Utah who represents many family members of the¬†2018 Lion Air crash¬†and¬†2019 Ethiopian Air crash¬†victims.                ‚ÄúThis deceptive and generous deal is clearly not in the public interest,‚Äù he added. The families are seeking a public trial on the charges.                Boeing issued a brief statement saying only that it can ‚Äúconfirm that we have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department, subject to ‚Ä¶ approval of specific terms.‚Äù                The guilty plea is a severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial jets. Beyond the fatal crashes of the 737 Max jets, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its planes.¬†In January, a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Air blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet, and further damaging Boeing‚Äôs reputation.        A design flaw hidden from regulators            According to the charges, the company defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the process of certifying the 737 Max to carry its first passengers. The plane started service in 2017, but the two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of the jets. Investigations revealed a design flaw in its autopilot system. Boeing has admitted responsibility for the fatal crashes, and that its employees withheld information about the design flaw from the FAA during certification.    FILE PHOTO: The fuselage plug area of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 Boeing 737-9 MAX, which was forced to make an emergency landing with a gap in the fuselage, is seen during its investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in Portland, Oregon, U.S. January 7, 2024.  NTSB/Handout via REUTERS./File PhotoNTSB/Handout via ReutersRelated articleBoeing was once known for safety and engineering. But critics say an emphasis on profits changed that            In January 2021, the Justice Department and Boeing had reached an agreement to settle criminal charges, and defer any prosecution on the matter. During a three-year probationary period that followed, Boeing agreed to improve its quality issues and transparency with the government. But days before that probationary period was due to end came the Alaska Air incident, which opened the door to further Justice Department action.                In May, the Justice Department said it was¬†looking into bringing criminal charges¬†against Boeing once again due to a potential violation of that January 2021 agreement. Boeing had argued in its own court filings that it did not violate the agreement and that it should be spared prosecution. Sunday night‚Äôs guilty plea, which came just before a midnight deadline set by the Justice Department, settled that issue.        Cost of the guilty plea            Under the original 2021 agreement, Boeing had agreed to pay $2.5 billion. But about 70% of that amount represented payments Boeing had already agreed to make to its airline customers as compensation for the 20-month grounding of the planes. Another $500 million was a fund to compensate crash victims. Only $243.6 million represented a criminal fine to the government, which would be doubled after the new guilty plea.                Boeing has also agreed to spend $455 million on its compliance and safety programs, over the next three years, which the government said will represent a 75% increase over what the company was spending annually on those programs.                The company‚Äôs various problems have caused deep financial losses since the second fatal 737 Max crash. It has posted core operating losses of $31.9 billion since the start of the 20-month grounding. It is also at risk of losing its investment grade credit rating for the first time in its history.                The company now has nearly $47 billion in long-term debt, and if its debt rating is downgraded to junk bond status, its cost of borrowing money will soar.                But an additional fine in the hundreds of millions, rather than the billions, is still affordable for the company, despite its financial woes.        No executives to face charges            The agreement does not call for prosecution of any current or former Boeing executives or other employees for their role in the certification process. The company also avoided another serious penalty ‚Äì the loss of the right to conduct business with the government.                Such a penalty would have been a near death sentence for the planemaker. About 37% of its revenue in 2023 came from federal contracts.                According to Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace and defense management consultant, the possibility of such a penalty was minimal as both Boeing and the federal government are heavily reliant on each other.                Despite its troubles over the last five years, Boeing is still a key component of the US economy. It remains the nation‚Äôs largest exporter, and has nearly 150,000 US employees. The company estimates its economic impact at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million direct and indirect jobs at more than 9,900 suppliers spread across all 50 states.                Its only significant rival for commercial aircraft, European manufacturer Airbus, has a backlog of more than 8,000 jet orders, meaning any Boeing customer placing an order for an Airbus plane today would have to wait nearly a decade for it to be delivered.

The exploratory analysis consisted of data from 96 women.The results were presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) 40th Annual Meeting in Amsterdam taking place from 7 to 10 July.OXO-001 is a non-hormonal fertility therapy that makes the uterine endometrium more susceptible to embryo implantation. The treatment is intended to be taken twice daily, starting one menstrual cycle before embryo transfer and then for five weeks after transfer.There is a growing demand for fertility treatments for women.

Sherwood has been blind for more than 15 years; he has a family, a successful investing career and a dog, Chris, who helps him navigate the world. But he says everyday tasks like shopping still present hurdles to his independence.                Artificial intelligence could soon help.                Currently, Sherwood says he sometimes uses an app called Be My Eyes, which pairs visually impaired users with sighted volunteers who provide help, through live video, with things like checking whether a shirt matches the rest of an outfit or if a carton of milk has expired. But advancements in AI technology are already beginning to remove the need for volunteer helpers on the other end.                Be My Eyes partnered with OpenAI last year to enable its AI model, rather than another human, see and describe what‚Äôs in front of a user. In OpenAI‚Äôs latest product demo, the company showed a clip of a person using the AI-powered version of Be My Eyes to hail a taxi ‚Äî the app told the user exactly when to raise their arm for the car. Google in May announced a similar feature for its app ‚ÄúLookout,‚Äù which is designed to help visually impaired users.    From OpenAIRelated articleOpenAI unveils newest AI model, GPT-4o            Applications for blind users are just one area where AI is helping to advance what‚Äôs known as ‚Äúassistive technology,‚Äù tools designed to help people who are disabled or elderly.                Apple, Google and other tech companies have rolled out a growing slate of AI-powered tools to make life easier for people with a range of impediments, from eye-tracking tools that let physically disabled users control their iPhones with their eyes to detailed voice guidance for blind users of Google Maps.                Since the stunning launch of ChatGPT more than a year ago, it has been clear that AI will change our world by upending how we work, how we communicate and even what we perceive as reality. But for people with disabilities, AI also has the potential to be life-altering in an entirely different way.                ‚ÄúIt used to be that if you were in business and you were blind, you had to have an administrative assistant reading to you,‚Äù Sherwood said. ‚ÄúBut now, you have this new power ‚Ä¶ For some, this is great technology. For blind people, this is an opportunity to gain employment and an opportunity to compete in business, an opportunity to succeed.‚Äù        The benefits of AI for accessibility            Tech companies have been using early forms of AI to make their products more accessible for years ‚Äî think, automated closed captioning on videos or screen readers.                But experts say that the huge data sets and powerful computing systems behind more recent AI models are accelerating what‚Äôs possible in the assistive tech space. For instance, in order for an AI tool to reliably help blind people hail taxis, it needs to be very good at recognizing what a taxi does or does not look like, which requires training the model on a huge corpus of examples.                Another example: a Google tool that tells blind or low-vision users about what‚Äôs on their screen, has been upgraded with a ‚Äúquestion and answer‚Äù feature that incorporates the company‚Äôs generative AI technology.    Sundar Pichai speaks about Gemini 1.5 pro during Google I/O developer conference today.GoogleRelated articleGoogle shows off astonishing vision for how AI will work with Gmail, Photos and more            ‚ÄúThe promise of AI has been evident for many, many years but it has to reach this quality level before it can be a viable thing that you include in products,‚Äù Eve Andersson, Google‚Äôs senior director of product inclusion, equity, and accessibility, told CNN.                New generative AI tools are especially promising for accessibility applications because they‚Äôre designed to understand and produce information in various formats, including text, audio, photos and videos. That means if a person needs to consume information in a certain medium, AI can act as a go-between; for instance, turning a piece of audio into written text for a hearing-impaired user.                ‚Äú(People‚Äôs) accessibility needs take many different forms, but a large class of disabilities are really about input and output, it‚Äôs about how a person perceives information,‚Äù Andersson said. ‚ÄúThere are hearing disabilities, vision, motor, speech, cognitive and all of these can involve a need for different modalities (of information) and one thing that AI is fantastic at is translating between modalities.‚Äù        Designing inclusive AI systems            Ensuring that AI systems continue to serve all kinds of users requires ongoing investment.                Because AI models are trained on human-created data, experts have warned that they may replicate the same biases present among humans. And early examples have already cropped up, including AI image generators that appeared to struggle with the concept of race, or an algorithm that allegedly showed job advertisements based on gendered stereotypes.                In one effort to address that risk, a group of Big Tech companies, including¬†Apple, Google, Microsoft and others,¬†have partnered with researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to create a training dataset for AI speech recognition tools that includes a diversity of speech patterns. Speech recognition tools, such as translators, voice assistants and voice-to-text apps can be especially important and useful for users with disabilities.                The effort, called the Speech Accessibility Project, involves collecting recordings from volunteers with conditions such as Parkinsons, Down Syndrome, ALS and other disabilities that can affect speech. With the help of the project‚Äôs now more than 200,000 recordings, a sample speech recognition tool created by the researchers misunderstands speech only 12% of the time, down from 20% prior to being trained on the new dataset.    Apple CEO Tim Cook waves while speaking at an announcement of new products on the Apple campus in Cupertino, Calif., Monday, June 10, 2024.Jeff Chiu/APRelated articleEverything Apple announced at its big AI event            ‚ÄúThe more diverse types of speech we can get into those machine learning systems and the greater variety of severity, the better those systems are going to be at understanding individuals that don‚Äôt have ‚Äòaudiobook narrator‚Äô speech,‚Äù said Clarion Mendes, a speech language pathologist and clinical assistant professor who helps lead the project.                ‚ÄúI have talked to so many people throughout this project who face huge barriers to life participation because of their communication, individuals with impressive degrees who can‚Äôt find employment because of their communication barriers,‚Äù Mendes said. ‚ÄúIf something like assistive technology can make it possible for individuals to find enrichment in their hobbies, in their jobs ‚Ä¶ all of a sudden these activities that used to take excessive amounts of time or require the person to rely on other individuals, that has increased their independence exponentially.‚Äù                Andersson added that investing in AI for accessibility is not just the right thing to do, it also makes good business sense.                ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to leave people behind ‚Ä¶ technology in general has the ability to level the playing field,‚Äù Andersson said. ‚ÄúBut there are also financial reasons like being able to sell your products to government entities, to educational institutions.‚Äù",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shares rose fractionally in premarket trading on Monday. ""We believe after a better than expected March quarter, spots of optimism for iPhone growth are forming in various markets and ultimately we now believe June will be the last negative growth quarter for China with a growth turnaround beginning in the September quarter,"" analyst Dan Ives wrote in an investor note. China remains the linchpin of growth for Apple and now this key region is set to see growth once again starting with iPhone 16 in our view. Ives has an Outperform rating and $275 price target on Apple. Optimism surrounding the tech giant has increased since last month, when it held its annual developers conference and showed off its approach to artificial intelligence, Ives said. With the next iPhone likely to be AI-focused, it could represent ""a golden upgrade cycle"" with pent-up demand likely to build around the world, Ives added. ""Developers and other technology stalwarts (Meta, Google could be in the near term mix in our view) will likely now need to integrate their AI models/technology into Apple Intelligence looking ahead as Apple and its golden iOS ecosystem hold the only keys to the castle of 2.2 billion iOS devices worldwide and 1.5 billion iPhones,"" Ives posited. ""We expect developers over the next 6 to 12 months will build hundreds of generative AI driven apps that will be key ingredients in the recipe for success for Apple as its technology stack creates the core building blocks of the consumer AI tidal wave we see coming starting with iPhone 16 in mid-September.""

VQePqy9fQZlrTC1,Seeking Alpha,bing,DIVZ: 2.87% Yield And Improved Fundamentals For This Actively Managed Dividend ETF,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702892-divz-2-87-percent-yield-and-improved-fundamentals-for-actively-managed-dividend-etf,2024-07-08 07:18,2024-07-08 07:34,AVGO,,"Dilok Klaisataporn Investment Thesis I last reviewed the Opal Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVZ) on May 5, 2023, describing how its high-conviction approach to dividend investing might appeal to the most conservative income investors. In my initial reviews, I questioned its managers' dedication to Energy stocks even as inflation peaked, but I noticed its exposure to the sector is down to a more reasonable 17%, and there have been several other exciting substitutions over the last year. Given these changes, it is appropriate to re-evaluate. In this article, I will reassess DIVZ's performance and fundamentals against four similar-yielding large-cap value funds. While I still have concerns about DIVZ's quality, I believe DIVZ's portfolio has significantly improved, so I have assigned the ETF a solid ""hold."" I hope you enjoy the review. DIVZ Overview Strategy Discussion According to the fund website, DIVZ ""is designed for investors seeking lower volatility with higher dividend yield than the overall market while still having access to capital appreciation opportunities."" Since its January 27, 2021 inception date, Austin Graff, the portfolio manager, has followed a disciplined strategy to select 25-35 companies across most sectors, currently only excluding Real Estate. These companies tend to have high cash conversion rates, low valuations, and reasonable growth expectations, albeit growth is not the primary objective. Instead, DIVZ has a dividend focus and recently accelerated its distribution schedule from quarterly to monthly, allowing more compounding opportunities for those opting to reinvest. Still, DIVZ's 0.65% expense ratio acts against the interests of income investors, since fees directly impact shareholder distributions. It's not a good feature, and unless this is addressed, DIVZ's AUM growth is limited. Granted, DIVZ had about a $40 million increase over just a couple of weeks in May and June, bringing its total to $107 million, but otherwise, there has been little added interest in the fund since my last review. Performance Analysis Between February 2021 and June 2024, DIVZ gained 37.71%, a decent result that ranks #54/75 in the large-cap value category. It slightly lagged the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), whose growth potential has disappeared over the last few years. However, it outperformed the Franklin U.S. Low Volatility High Dividend Index ETF (LVHD) and the Invesco S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio ETF (SPHD) by 14% and 4%, respectively. Portfolio Visualizer DIVZ did exceptionally well in 2022 as its high allocation to Energy stocks proved a winning strategy. However, the sector fell out of favor and DIVZ declined by 0.52% the following year. SCHD also has its fair share of growth-related problems, and LVHD and SPHD have always struggled with quality. Still, as an actively managed fund, I hoped DIVZ's manager would trade more frequently as market conditions changed. Please see the table below for a more comprehensive overview of the total returns for high-dividend ETFs for this period. The Sunday Investor There are a few exceptions, but most of the top performers have lower trailing dividend yields. Generally, growth rates and yields are negatively correlated, and since growth rates have declined substantially for value stocks over the last two years, many ETFs are incredibly unbalanced. Put differently, they were operating in a growth-favored market while featuring low-single-digit or negative earnings growth rates, which is a recipe for disaster. That's why SCHD has performed poorly recently, and others like the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV) have stood out. I made the call in December 2021 in this review of FDVV, and based on the number of articles published recently, most analysts have come to appreciate its balanced mix of growth, value, and dividends. I've covered most of these ETFs before, but I chose SCHD, SPHD, and LVHD as comparators because they consistently emphasize less-volatile high dividend stocks. I will also include the Federated Hermes U.S. Strategic Dividend ETF (FDV), another actively managed fund with a similar strategy. DIVZ Analysis Composition Analysis DIVZ is an ETF for stock pickers, as it includes only 31 holdings. I've listed them all along with their cash-adjusted weights and their allocations in FDV, SCHD, LVHD, and SPHD. The Sunday Investor As shown, DIVZ has a substantially different composition than these peers. FDV is the most similar, with 26.54% allocated to these holdings, so at a minimum, it's different than what you might already own. NextEra Energy (NEE) and American Electric Power (AEP) are the top two Utilities stocks, which give it a nice defensive feel. At the same time, there are some higher-risk stocks in the Technology and Financials stocks like Broadcom (AVGO) and Citigroup (C), each with five-year betas of 1.19 and 1.45, respectively. Based on this composition and my prior research of the fund, DIVZ's manager is a student of Modern Portfolio Theory, supporting the concept that the sum of a portfolio's parts is greater than the whole. He's selected stocks that he believes work well together and can maximize risk-adjusted returns. To illustrate, here is a three-year backtest of the current holdings and weights, set to rebalance quarterly. To get that history, I removed DIVZ's smallest holding, Kenvue (KVUE), as it only began trading after it separated from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) on August 23, 2023. Portfolio Visualizer The current portfolio gained 40.61% between July 2023 and June 2024 compared to 32.92% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). In addition, its risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio) were far superior, so I'm confident DIVZ's manager at least considers these types of simulations. From a sector allocation perspective, DIVZ is reasonably well-diversified, with no sector accounting for more than 20% of the portfolio and allocations to 24 unique sub-industries. That's good for a 31-stock fund, but diversification will always be a potential weakness with these types of funds. The Sunday Investor DIVZ Dividend Analysis DIVZ has an ""A"" Dividend Grade from Seeking Alpha. However, the change to monthly distributions made some calculations that drove this grade inaccurate. For example, the total distributions over the last year four quarters (three quarterly payments, three monthly payments) were $0.9172 per share, and based on the current $30.37 share price, the trailing dividend yield is 3.02%. The 3.70% listed below incorrectly includes the extra June 2023 payment of $0.2070 per share. Seeking Alpha As a result, the dividend growth rates listed are also not accurate. The prior year's dividend per share totaled $0.9319, so the one-year dividend growth rate is -1.58%, not 20.77%. Finally, the three-year dividend growth rate can't be calculated since DIVZ has yet to have the required four years of history. Therefore, it's safe to assume DIVZ will not earn an ""A"" Dividend Grade once these differences are corrected. DIVZ Fundamental Analysis The following table highlights selected fundamental metrics for DIVZ's top 25 holdings, totaling 89.59% of the portfolio. I've also included summary metrics for FDV, LVHD, SPHD, and SCHD at the bottom. The Sunday Investor Here are four observations to consider: 1. DIVZ's weighted average dividend yield is 3.52%, but after deducting its 0.65% expense ratio, shareholders can only expect 2.87%. It's certainly disappointing for income investors, but from a total returns perspective, it's not a negative. One of DIVZ's most significant changes over the last year is an increase in semiconductor exposure from 2.97% to 10.87%. DIVZ now holds Broadcom (AVGO), QUALCOMM (QCOM), and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and removed Analog Devices (ADI), which substantially improved the portfolio's momentum characteristics. Seeking Alpha 2. DIVZ has a 0.91 five-year beta, much higher than the 0.73 figure from May 2023. Again, this might be a positive, as it reduces the chances that DIVZ will underperform if the bull market continues. Looking at the individual stock betas, DIVZ takes more of a barbell approach to risk management compared to other ETFs, which is made possible through its active strategy. Despite having the same 0.91 beta, DIVZ has 26% allocated to stocks with betas above 1.25 compared to 21% for SCHD. It's a nice feature that helps improve the portfolio's efficiency. 3. The change in semiconductor and energy stocks has helped DIVZ maintain a respectable 3.89% and 3.18% estimated one-year sales and earnings per share growth rate, setting it apart from SCHD's 0.65% and -1.00% figures. Importantly, DIVZ has improved its forward P/E discount over SCHD from 1.05 points to 1.43 points (16.08x vs. 17.51x), so I think it offers a nice mix of growth and value. As discussed earlier, maintaining that balance is crucial to avoid substantial underperformance in case certain factors fall out of favor (i.e., low volatility, value). As an actively managed fund, DIVZ can do that easier than most, and I hope it keeps up. 4. DIVZ's main weakness is its quality, evidenced by an 8.21/10 Profit Score I derived using individual Seeking Alpha Factor Grades. Among large-cap value ETFs, that score ranks #97/108, and the main reason is ""F"" grades for Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Goldman Sachs (GS). For Financial sector stocks, it's common to use ROA as the primary measure of quality, and among its sector peers with market caps above $100 billion, they do, in fact, rank at the bottom. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) are possible alternatives, as their ROAs are at least above 1%, but I assume they were excluded due to their low dividend yields. Investment Recommendation  I prefer buying high-quality stocks, so DIVZ's weakness in that factor disappoints me, and I'm hesitant to issue a ""buy"" rating. In addition, its 0.65% expense ratio works against the interests of income investors, leading to a somewhat low 2.87% expected dividend yield that I doubt will attract many new investors. Still, the portfolio is much more balanced than before, especially given its added exposure to higher-growth Technology stocks and lower exposure to less predictable Energy stocks. DIVZ also trades at an attractive 16.08x forward earnings (13.76x harmonic weighted average), and its 0.91 five-year beta indicates it can still offer some decent downside protection should markets fall. Therefore, I rate DIVZ a solid ""hold"", and I think it's back to being one of the more exciting active funds investors should keep their eye on moving forward. Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your comments below.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each layer of a chip‚Äôs wiring begins with a thin film of dielectric material, which is etched to create channels that are filled with copper. Low-k dielectrics and copper have been the industry‚Äôs workhorse wiring combination for decades, allowing chipmakers to deliver improvements in scaling, performance and power-efficiency with each generation. However, as the industry scales to 2nm and below, thinner dielectric material renders chips mechanically weaker, and narrowing the copper wires creates steep increases in electrical resistance that can reduce chip performance and increase power consumption. Enhanced Low-k Dielectric Reduces Interconnect Resistance and Strengthens Chips for 3D Stacking Applied‚Äôs Black Diamond‚Ñ¢ material has led the industry for decades, surrounding copper wires with a low-dielectric-constant ‚Äì or ‚Äúk-value‚Äù ‚Äì film engineered to reduce the buildup of electrical charges that increase power consumption and cause interference between electrical signals. Applied today introduced an enhanced version of Black Diamond, the latest in the company‚Äôs Producer‚Ñ¢ Black Diamond‚Ñ¢ PECVD* family. This new material reduces the minimum k-value to enable scaling to 2nm and below, while offering increased mechanical strength which is becoming critical as chipmakers and systems companies take 3D logic and memory stacking to new heights. The latest Black Diamond technology is being adopted by all leading logic and DRAM chipmakers. New Binary Metal Liner Enables Ultrathin Copper Wires To scale chip wiring, chipmakers etch each layer of low-k film to create trenches, then deposit a barrier layer that prevents copper from migrating into the chip and creating yield issues. The barrier is then coated with a liner that ensures adhesion during the final copper reflow deposition sequence, which slowly fills the remaining volume with copper. As chipmakers further scale the wiring, the barrier and liner take up a larger percentage of the volume intended for wiring, and it becomes physically impossible to create low-resistance, void-free copper wiring in the remaining space. Today, Applied Materials¬†publicly introduced its latest IMS‚Ñ¢ (Integrated Materials Solution‚Ñ¢) which combines six different technologies in one high-vacuum system, including an industry-first combination of materials that enables chipmakers to scale copper wiring to the 2nm node and beyond. The solution is a binary metal combination of ruthenium and cobalt (RuCo), which simultaneously reduces the thickness of the liner by 33 percent to 2nm, produces better surface properties for void-free copper reflow, and reduces electrical line resistance by up to 25 percent to improve chip performance and power consumption. The new Applied Endura‚Ñ¢ Copper Barrier Seed IMS‚Ñ¢ with Volta‚Ñ¢ Ruthenium CVD* is being adopted by all leading logic chipmakers and began shipping to customers at the 3nm node. An animation of the technology can be viewed here. Customer Comments ‚ÄúWhile advances in patterning are driving continued device scaling, critical challenges remain in other areas including interconnect wiring resistance, capacitance and reliability,‚Äù said Sunjung Kim, VP & Head of Foundry Development Team at Samsung Electronics. ‚ÄúTo help overcome these challenges, Samsung is adopting multiple materials engineering innovations that extend the benefits of scaling to the most advanced nodes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe semiconductor industry must deliver dramatic improvements in energy-efficient performance to enable sustainable growth in AI computing,‚Äù said Dr. Y.J. Mii, Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer at TSMC. ‚ÄúNew materials that reduce interconnect resistance will play an important role in the semiconductor industry, alongside other innovations to improve overall system performance and power.‚Äù A Growing Wiring Opportunity Applied is the industry leader in chip wiring process technologies. From the 7nm node to the 3nm node, interconnect wiring steps have approximately tripled, increasing Applied‚Äôs served available market opportunity in wiring by more than $1 billion per 100,000 wafer starts per month (100K WSPM) of greenfield capacity, to approximately $6 billion. Looking ahead, the introduction of backside power delivery is expected to increase Applied‚Äôs wiring opportunity by another $1 billion per 100K WSPM, to approximately $7 billion. The new chip wiring products, along with other materials engineering innovations for making future AI chips, will be discussed at Applied‚Äôs SEMICON West 2024 Technology Breakfast.

GHujOEq9XVZbyz6,Yahoo Finance,bing,HilleVax Reports Topline Data from NEST-IN1 Phase 2b Clinical Study of HIL-214 in Infants,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hillevax-reports-topline-data-nest-113000979.html,2024-07-08 07:47,2024-07-08 07:49,ARM,,"HilleVax, Inc.The NEST-IN1 clinical study did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints, and the company will discontinue further development of HIL-214 in infantsThe company is exploring the potential for continued development of HIL-214 and HIL-216 in adultsBOSTON, July 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HilleVax, Inc. (Nasdaq: HLVX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel vaccines, today announced topline data results from NEST-IN1. NEST-IN1 is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of HIL-214 in infants of approximately 5 months of age at the time of initial vaccination at sites in the United States and Latin America.In the NEST-IN1 study there were 51 primary endpoint events with 25 in the vaccine arm (n=1,425) and 26 in the placebo arm (n=1,399) resulting in vaccine efficacy of 5% (95% confidence interval; -64%, 45%). The study did not meet its primary endpoint of efficacy against moderate or severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) events due to GI.1 or GII.4 norovirus genotypes. No clinical benefit was observed across secondary endpoints. HIL-214 exhibited a safety and immunogenicity profile consistent with what was observed in the prespecified analysis of the first 200 subjects in NEST-IN1 and in previously reported studies.‚ÄúWe are disappointed that the NEST-IN1 study did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint,‚Äù said Rob Hershberg, MD, PhD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of HilleVax. ‚ÄúWhile HIL-214 previously showed clinical benefit in adults, NEST-IN1 was the first efficacy study conducted in infants for a norovirus vaccine candidate. We believe the efficacy in the infant setting may have been impacted by the appearance of multiple emerging GII.4 strains in this trial.‚Äù‚ÄúWe sincerely thank the trial investigators, clinical sites and the HilleVax team for conducting a highly rigorous study, and we are deeply appreciative to the infants and families that participated in this trial,‚Äù said Dr. Hershberg.The NEST-IN1 study was conducted after a Phase 2b study in adults, NOR-211, demonstrated statistically significant efficacy against moderate or severe AGE due to norovirus. The company plans to discontinue further development of HIL-214 in infants and is exploring the potential for continued development of HIL-214 and HIL-216, HilleVax‚Äôs Phase 1 ready vaccine candidate, in adults.About HilleVaxHilleVax is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel vaccines. Its initial program, HIL-214, is a virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccine candidate in development for the prevention of moderate-to-severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) caused by norovirus infection. Globally, norovirus is estimated to result in over approximately 700 million cases of AGE and 200,000 deaths per year, resulting in over $4 billion in direct health system costs and $60 billion in societal costs per year. The burden of norovirus falls disproportionately on young children and older adults.

Okb7ceMNvuxBpxI,BBC,bing,Deadline set for paid-for garden waste collection,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51yrx08ejzo,2024-07-08 07:36,2024-07-08 07:50,COST,,"Residents in York have until 5 August to apply to have their garden waste collected by the council for an annual charge of ¬£46.50. Collections of green waste were previously free but City of York Council said it was a ""tough choice"" to introduce charges for 66,000 properties, which were part of ""necessary cuts"" during the cost of living crisis. The authority said anyone who did not want to subscribe to the Garden Waste Subscription Scheme, would not have their green waste collected. All properties eligible for kerbside garden waste collection in the city would be sent information about the service this week, officials said. Councillor Jenny Kent, executive member for the environment and climate emergency at the council, said: ""Nobody wants to have another charge for something that they value.   ""We‚Äôre not taking it away. We‚Äôre giving people the option to continue to pay for it if they value it."" Ms Kent said people who did not want to sign up for the scheme could take waste to recycling sites at Hazel Court or Towthorpe, or could use the most ""environmentally-friendly option to compost at home"". Ms Kent added: ""It is part of our necessary cuts that we had to make because of the cost of living crisis, it‚Äôs a service we very much value."" The subscription garden waste service will operate for 40 weeks per year, running from March to December. However, as the council is introducing the charge part way through the year, the new service will be charged on a pro-rata basis, with the fee for 2024 set at  ¬£21.00. A spokesperson for the council said more than 70% of local authorities in the country already charged for garden waste collections. They said the new scheme would help to protect other key local services. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

Shares in Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META) remain in focus this week after soaring 5.9% to a new record close on Friday. The stock was buoyed by recent commentary from analysts at Bernstein who pointed out that the company‚Äôs significant investment in artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to translate into revenue growth through users spending more time on the social media giant‚Äôs apps. Below, we take a closer look Meta‚Äôs weekly chart and point out important technical levels to watch out for.  Breakout from Pennant Pattern   Since bottoming out in October last year, Meta shares have trended sharply higher, with gains accelerating after the 50-week moving average (MA) crossed above the 200-week MA in late November to form a golden cross, a chart signal that typically predicts rising prices. More recently, the stock broke out from a pennant pattern on Friday that suggests a continuation of the longer-term uptrend. However, investors should still exercise a degree of caution as several technical indicators point to slowing price momentum. Firstly, share turnover has trended lower since early February. Secondly, as the stock made a higher high last week, the relative strength index (RSI) made a shallower higher to create a bearish divergence.  Measuring Principle to Project Upside Price Target   If the stock continues to move to the upside, we can project a potential price target by using the measuring principle. To do this, we calculate the distance of the most recent leg higher in points preceding the pennant and apply that amount to the pattern's top trendline.¬† In this case, we add $257 to $510 that projects a price target of $767, which sits about 42% above Friday‚Äôs closing price. This provides us with a general area on the chart where Meta‚Äôs shares may run into overhead resistance, particularly if other indicators are simultaneously pointing to overbought conditions at the same time.  Monitor These Levels During Periods of Profit Taking   During retracements, investors should keep an eye on two key levels on the chart that may attract buying interest. The first level to watch sits around $384, an area likely to find support from the stock‚Äôs prior August 2021 high that aligns closely with the rising 50-week MA. A close below this level could see the shares fall to around $300, where they would potentially attract buyers near the 200-week MA and a multi-year horizontal line linking a range of price action between August 2020 and October last year. Meta shares were up 0.4% at $542.15 in premarket trading about two hours before Monday's opening bell.

One example of a perceived AI loser temporarily cast aside was the Strategy‚Äôs top detractor for the quarter, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), whose shares declined as it put out financial targets for 2027 that were below Wall Street expectations, and also noted that demand for its core PC and server chips remained depressed. We take a contrarian view of Intel and do not think it will be an AI loser, but rather see underappreciated opportunity as AI PCs ramp over the next few quarters in enterprises, where Intel has a stronghold. We also believe that the company‚Äôs technology roadmap remains intact, which we believe will lead to a stabilization in market share in its core PC and server markets.

XnNI2BEC1zCvDF9,The Motley Fool,google,3 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy in July,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/08/3-no-brainer-stocks-to-buy-in-july/,2024-07-08 08:00,2024-07-08 08:04,REGN,,"July is for barbecues, fireworks, and vacations. Many people don't want to think too hard about anything. Three Fool.com contributors think they have solutions for those investors who don't want to think too hard.Here's why they picked Eli Lilly (LLY 1.83%), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN 0.99%), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.91%) as no-brainer biotech stocks to buy in July.Eli Lilly is likely to surpass $1 trillion in valueDavid Jagielski (Eli Lilly): One of the best growth stocks you can buy right now is Eli Lilly. The healthcare company has plenty of growth catalysts in its portfolio, which can pave the way for its valuation to soar past $1 trillion.Today, it has diabetes treatment Mounjaro and recently approved weight loss drug Zepbound, which together have generated $2.3 billion in revenue in the first three months of the year. Mounjaro is now the company's top-selling drug, overtaking Trulicity. And there's much more growth ahead. Eli Lilly may have a couple of more promising weight-loss products to add to its growing portfolio. Retatrutide is in phase 3 trials and has been showing impressive results, helping patients lose 24% of their weight, in what could be its best weight loss drug yet. Its oral pill, orforglipron, is also in late-stage trials and could be yet another catalyst.Beyond weight loss, another promising product is its Alzheimer's treatment donanemab, which looks poised to be a blockbuster as well. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the drug, which Lilly will market under the brand name Kisunla.Eli Lilly's stock has nearly doubled in the past 12 months, and with so much growth still on the horizon for the business, it's hard not to like the stock for the long haul. What better time to buy the stock than in July, right before it reports earnings in August and investors get insight into how much more revenue Zepbound and Mounjaro are generating, along with potential upgrades to its forecast?Not only is this healthcare stock the odds-on favorite to hit $1 trillion first, but it could also blow past that valuation in the long haul.Regeneron shows no signs of slowing downProsper Junior Bakiny (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals): It hasn't always been pretty, easy, or straightforward, but Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has delivered returns well above average in the past five years. We can point to the drugmaker's innovative abilities to explain that performance. During the earlier days of the pandemic, Regeneron developed and marketed a COVID-19 antibody that meaningfully contributed to its revenue. Sales of this product fell off a cliff last year.However, Regeneron can still count on two of its leading assets: eczema treatment Dupixent, and Eylea, which treats wet age-related macular degeneration. Dupixent looks particularly promising. It has been Regeneron's biggest growth driver for some time, and it is about to get even better. The company is seeking a label expansion for its crown jewel in treating COPD, which it just obtained in the European Union. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could grant the same label expansion by late September.To what effect? Estimates vary, but some analysts expect the COPD indication to add $3.5 billion to Dupixent's sales. The medicine's revenue last year, recorded by Regeneron's partner on this program, Sanofi was about $11.6 billion.Regeneron has other growth drivers beyond Dupixent and Eylea, and, importantly, it has an exciting pipeline of candidates. The company has one particularly exciting early-stage program, a gene therapy for genetic deafness, that has restored hearing in one patient and significantly improved it in another in an ongoing phase 1/2 study.There's a long way to go for this candidate, but whether it succeeds or not, Regeneron's pipeline features more than four-dozen candidates. The company's history of innovation speaks for itself. Regeneron should be able to deliver important breakthroughs and generate excellent financial results over the long run, just as in the past. Strong stock market performances should follow.Sit back and watch Vertex continue to growKeith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): I think Vertex Pharmaceuticals is the kind of stock you can buy, then sit back and watch it grow. That's because the big biotech company has several growth drivers that should work to its advantage.The obvious one is Vertex's cystic fibrosis (CF) franchise. Its blockbuster drug Trikafta/Kaftrio dominates the CF market. No other company has an approved therapy that treats the underlying cause of CF.Vertex could soon have another big winner in the CF indication, though. The FDA is set to make an approval decision on the company's vanzacaftor triple combination by Jan. 2, 2025.Vertex's newest approved product, Casgevy, should also soon begin to rake in impressive revenue. It's the first CRISPR gene-editing therapy to win regulatory approval. Casgevy is a one-and-done treatment for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia.Keep your eyes on suzetrigine (VX-548) as well. Vertex could win U.S. approval for the non-opioid drug in treating acute pain early next year. The company is also advancing the drug into a phase 2 study targeting peripheral neuropathic pain. Suzetrigine should have a tremendous commercial opportunity. Vertex's pipeline features another promising late-stage program, inaxaplin, which targets APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD). The company sees a path to file for accelerated approval for the drug if the results from a planned interim analysis after 48 weeks of treatment look good.The pending acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences could give Vertex yet another late-stage candidate. Vertex views Alpine's povetacicept, a potential kidney disease treatment, as a ""pipeline-in-a-product"" that could lead to other treatments down the road. There's always some level of risk with any biotech stock. However, I think Vertex's odds of success look very good.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

New energy vehicles (NEVs) include electric cars and plug-in hybrids.ADVERTISEMENT""Our (NEV export) growth used to be at least 30-40%, and it has slowed to only more than 10%, meaning (the tariffs) had a 20-30 percentage point impact on (NEV export growth), a conspicuous short-term impact,"" Cui added.He was speaking after the CPCA reported that China's domestic car sales fell for the third month running in June.NEV exports rose 12.3% year-on-year in June, but were down 15.2% from May, the data showed, with NEV exports accounting for 21% of total car exports, down 3 percentage points from June 2023.Amid the EU's crackdown, U.S. electric carmaker Tesla's exports of China-made EVs in April-June fell to the lowest level since the third quarter of 2022, when its Shanghai factory operations were largely suspended during a COVID lockdown. Europe is the largest export market for Tesla EVs made at the Shanghai plant.China's total car exports for June rose 28% year on year following a 23% gain in May, underpinned by robust gasoline car exports, according to the CPCA.Domestically, China's car sales fell 6.9% in June from a year earlier, dropping for a third straight month as government incentives failed to spur consumer demand in a sputtering economic recovery.Story continuesPassenger vehicle sales totalled 1.78 million, with the pace of decline picking up from a 2.2% drop in May and a 5.8% fall in April.A price war since 2023 helped to lift Chinese vehicle sales earlier in the year but is having less effect in recent months despite fresh government subsidies for trading in cars, which were announced in April.For the first half of the year, China's domestic car sales were up 2.9% at 9.93 million vehicles.June sales of NEVs accounted for a record 48.1% of domestic car sales.Chinese EV giant BYD and relative newcomers such as Nio, Zeekr and Leapmotor all logged record monthly sales.Overall growth in EV sales cooled to 9.9% from 27.4% in May while sales of plug-in hybrids jumped 67.2%, up from a 61.1% increase the previous month.Underscoring weakness in consumer demand, a vehicle inventory alert index compiled by the China Automobile Dealers Association rose by 8.3 percentage points year on year to 62.3% in June.(Reporting by Qiaoyi Li, Zhang Yan and Sarah Wu; Editing by David Goodman and Mark Potter)",,True,European tariffs are impacting China's exports of electric and plug-in hybrid cars.

wAcE4c3A68kkZnb,Seeking Alpha,google,Nvidia: Reversion To The Mean Risk (NASDAQ:NVDA),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702849-nvidia-stock-reversion-to-the-mean-risk-maintain-hold,2024-07-08 08:00,2024-07-08 08:16,NVDA,,"BING-JHEN HONG Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains a runaway train with AI GPU sales continuing to surge beyond all original expectations. The biggest question is the ultimate size of the AI chip market and the market share of Nvidia, which currently has an estimated 95% of the market as peers finally ramp up sales. My investment thesis remains Neutral on the stock, though momentum appears to build for another big run higher.   Source: Finviz Mega Gains Already After adjusting for the recent 10-for-1 stock split, Nvidia traded at around $12 per share following the 2022 tech sell off and now the stock has soared back to $125 with recently hit a high of $140. Nvidia is up 1,000% during just a 2-year period. During this period, sales have surged due to soaring demand for AI GPUs. The company has seen data center revenues surge from around $4 billion per quarter to over $22 billion in FQ1'25 with total quarterly sales now at $26 billion. Source: Forbes/I/O Fund Sales have only risen about 400% during this period with the stock is up 2.5x as much. The stock is clearly factoring in additional upside for AI accelerator chip sales growth in the years ahead. AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su has famously factored in a $400 billion data center opportunity in 2027. The big question is how much of this market Nvidia captures with the recent quarterly results skewed due to AMD not having GPU chip supplies for the market and Intel (INTC) still being mostly absent from the AI chip market. The market assigns Nvidia sales targets for FY28 (Jan.) at $224 billion for over 60% of the data center market. Remember, the consensus target is for FY25 sales of $120 billion for nearly 87% upside in the 3-year period. The prime hyperscaler customers are already spending billions in additional capex, limiting the ability to increase the annual spend on GPUs. Both Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) were spending ~$7 billion per quarter on capex and the amounts have already soared to $11 to $12 billion. Data by YCharts Meta Platforms (META) is in the midst of their big push after trying to cut back spending in 2023 with a plan to spend $35 to $40 billion in 2024. Either way, the major AI GPU spenders will increase capex by a combined $50 billion annually, which is already factored into the Nvidia revenue estimates for FY25. These companies just aren't going to spend vastly more on an annual basis. The higher GPU spending will have to come from other sources. Nvidia has an estimated 98% of the GPU market, which is expected to be whittled down to 95% for 2024. The real key is how much AMD can whittle down the massive margins produced by Nvidia now without any competition. Unmatched Margins Nvidia is a complex investment as soaring GPU demand is offset by a massive stock valuation and stretched margins. Investors really have to derive a peak and normalized margins investment profile. The stock trades at 26x forward sales targets with a market cap of $3.1 trillion. Clearly, Nvidia is one of the largest stocks in the world based on multiple expansion and a reversal to trend would have Nvidia trading more mourned the multiples of peers. AMD and Intel both trade at much smaller multiples. Data by YCharts The market is definitely factoring in sales growth far into the future with Nvidia already trading at 10x FY32 sales targets of $345 billion. As noted, AMD is forecast to produce some sizable sales growth from AI GPUs, but the stock only trades at 11x forward sales now. The prime reason sales figure is a valid way to value a stock is that it normalizes for volatile margins, whether strong or weak. As my previous research highlighted, Nvidia doesn't have normal margins now with gross margins soaring above 78% (above 65% pre-AI) and operating margins of nearly 65% (above 3x% pre-AI). The company actually produced non-GAAP operating margins of an astounding 69%. Data by YCharts Nvidia already generated margins above normal semiconductor levels prior to the AI GPU demand explosion, especially for a company of this scale. Intel was the largest and most successful semiconductor company in the world, and gross margins were only 60% and operating margins in the 35%. The key to the investing story is understanding that Nvidia likely maintains these high margins over the next year with the hot Blackwell product rolling out, but margins will ultimately normalize. Blackwell GPUs are targeted to price at $30,000 to $40,000 while only costing $6,000 for a gross margin of 80% to 85%, though Nvidia is likely to focus on selling full package of multiple accelerators and memory. Under this scenario, Nvidia can look cheap under the current analysis consensus for a $3.60 EPS in FY26. The stock only trades at 36x these EPS targets, but the key is understanding the details of how Nvidia appears relatively cheap for a stock that has ballooned into one of the most valuable in the world. Nvidia is only forecasting FQ2.25 operating expenses of $2.8 billion. The whole story is whether the company can continue producing GPU hotcakes producing 75%+ gross margins while maintaining a nearly absurdly low level of opex. As competitors hit the market, the natural corporate response is to ramp up spending and AMD has a viable product lineup on market now while the MI400 should be competitive with the Blackwell GPUs. AMD is expected to finally have additional supply in the 2H after massive limitations on available product to start 2024. The issue for Nvidia investors is what happens when margins normalize back at previous levels: Source: Stone Fox Capital Advisors As the forecasted financials highlight, the EPS estimate is vastly different on a normalization of operating margins. Even with a 65% operating margin, Nvidia only delivers a FY28 EPS of $4.86 versus the consensus analyst estimate of $5.40. The big issue is what happens, if margins normalize. With 35% operating margins, the EPS dips to only $2.61. Even if Nvidia maintains 75% market share on a $400 billion data center market in 2027, revenues of $300 billion only produces an EPS of $3.49 for FY28. Over the last year, our investment view has generally been bullish to Neutral on the stock. Clear signs existed for Nvidia having excessive growth in the years ahead, but risk entered the picture when the stock price surged more than sales. Even now, the stock appears set to head higher in the short term. The ultimate key though, is that Nvidia has to hit the very aggressive revenue target of $300 billion with the normalized margins for the EPS of just $3.49 per share. If an investor slaps the current P/E multiple of 37x on the stock, Nvidia would only trade at $129. The stock is unlikely to maintain such a high P/E multiple with margins slipping. The risk is for the stock to hit the $225 billion analyst target and for normalized margins to push the EPS down to only $2.61. The stock would be hard pressed to trade above $100. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that anyone willing to trade Nvidia over the next 6 to 12 months can probably see further gains to the upside. The biggest key is understanding the elevated margins make the stock appear cheaper than reality. Nvidia will likely ultimately crash with the addition of competitive GPUs and eventual margin pressure.  Investors can ride the stock higher, but don't over stay being bullish on Nvidia.

The U.S. tech giant will soon require China-based staff to use only Apple's (AAPL) devices to verify their identities when logging in to work computers or smartphone, the report added citing an internal memo reviewed by the news agency. The move is part of Microsoft's global Secure Future Initiative and will impact hundreds of workers in Chinese mainland. The measure is aimed at making sure that all staff use the Microsoft Authenticator password manager and Identity Pass app. Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google Play is not available in China, unlike Apple's iOS store, so domestic phone makers such as Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi (OTCPK:XIACF) (OTCPK:XIACY) run their own platforms. Microsoft has chosen to restrict access from those devices to its corporate resources as they do not have Google's mobile services in the country, the message noted. Any employee using Android handsets √¢¬Ä¬î including products manufactured by Huawei or Xiaomi √¢¬Ä¬î will be provided with an iPhone 15, as a one-time buy, the memo noted. Microsoft will provide iPhones for collection at several hubs in China, including Hong Kong, where Google's services are accessible. The measure could again call attention to the iPhone's situation in China. Since last year, several Chinese government-backed firms and agencies have told employees to stop bringing foreign devices to work, citing security reasons, the report noted. Microsoft has been improving security globally after seeing repeat attacks from state-sponsored hackers, with a Russia-linked breach disclosed in January impacting several U.S. government agencies, including the State Department.

A copy of the same can be¬†downloaded here. There was a sharp increase in the stock market from mid-October 2023 through March 2024. Mega cap technology and growth stocks were the leading sectors while the strength was broader as the Energy, Financials, Healthcare, and Industrial sectors outperformed. A general sense of optimism was present as the S&P 500 had its best first quarter since 2019. The letter discussed news in credit cards and a $30 billion interchange settlement. In addition, please check the fund‚Äôs top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.Manole Capital Management highlighted stocks like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a payment technology company with a market capitalization of $417.853 billion. The one-month return of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) was 0.05%, and its shares gained 14.62% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On May 24, 2024, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stock closed at $449.49 per share.Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:""We have invested in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa since their IPO‚Äôs, in 2006 and 2008 respectively. When both payment companies initially listed, they identified potential legal liabilities stemming from merchant interchange lawsuits. During its IPO roadshow, Visa took a somewhat differentiated tact, by shielding new public shareholders from this liability and putting the risk onto the shoulders of its banking partners, card issuers, and earliest owners.Over the last few decades, there have been numerous settlements, as well as legislation impacting payment industry. The Durbin Amendment, inside of Dodd-Frank legislation in 2010, altered debit fees. Also, a court ordered interchange settlement was approved over 15 years ago, but it was not fully embraced by the merchant community. Last year, Senator Durbin announced his intention to alter the payment environment again, with his CCCA (Credit Card Competition Act). This created a headwind for the networks, as it appeared that legislation from DC was on the horizon.

All of our research notes can be read at www.manolecapital.com, under the ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù tab.

For a moment, Nvidia even became the world‚Äôs most valuable company on June 18th. But, Nvidia got dethroned quickly due to concerns over the sustainability of its skyrocketing growth. On the other hand, Microsoft and Apple are ahead in terms of market size. Looking at past numbers, Apple was the first the reach the first three of the trillion valuation milestones. Both Apple and Microsoft are as strong as ever, but Nvidia has an incredible momentum on its side. But, just because it enjoys dominating the market does not mean it should not take seriously the threat of AMD or Intel catching up at some point, although Nvidia does have the resources to defend itself and continue to innovate. Perhaps Nvidia‚Äôs biggest protection lies in its expansion of revenue sources as it aims to go beyond chips and build an entire AI ecosystem, ensuring it remains in the center of things as opposed to being only one link in the chain.Nvidia‚Äôs Promise Of BlackwellAt the end of June, Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang spoke at the company‚Äôs annual general meeting and pitched the upcoming Blackwell chips as not only the most successful product in Nvidia‚Äôs history but also in the entire computer history. Huan proudly spoke of reinventing Nvidia, the computer industry, and consequently, the world. The good part is that at the absolute end, Nvidia still does not have a big rival. But only time will show if the AI hype is enough to propel Nvidia to new heights, refuting doubts of concerned investors.Putting the the economic promise of AI and the fourth Industrial Revolution aside, there is a lot that is still unknown, the market dynamic is shaped with a lot of uncertainty that is out of even Big Tech‚Äôs control, all of which would undoubtedly impact their path to a $4 trillion valuation. In addition, there‚Äôs the long-term tech battle to think about in a new AI-shaped era that is in the making.¬†DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Despite years of efforts to block our services, they remain accessible to users,‚Äù Zdolnikov wrote. ‚ÄúIt turns out that Apple did this work for the Russian authorities and with better quality.‚ÄùKonstantin Votinov, the founder of Le VPN, told TechCrunch that the company received a message from Apple on July 4, notifying them of the removal. In Le VPN‚Äôs case, according to Votinov, Roskomnadzor flagged the app‚Äôs description on the App Store as ‚Äúinfringing content.‚Äù¬†‚ÄúWe received a notice from [Roskomnadzor] via Apple after our app had already been removed, giving us no opportunity to address the concerns. This appears to be part of a broader crackdown affecting at least 25 VPN providers in Russia,‚Äù Votinov said.¬†Apple in 2022 halted hardware exports to Russia and stopped some services to protest its invasion of Ukraine, though its app store remains open.

LAZicNLRPGkJhdn,Seeking Alpha,bing,Arm Holdings: A Complementary Investment To Nvidia,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702993-arm-holdings-a-complementary-investment-to-nvidia,2024-07-08 15:01,2024-07-08 15:14,ARM,,"Mindful Media/E+ via Getty Images In the past few months, I've written several Seeking Alpha articles centered on Artificial Intelligence. Last month I wrote about Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) in a June 11 article entitled ""Broadcom: Eyes On AI But 5G Outperforms On Revenue,"" and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) in a June 17 article entitled ""Nvidia: Why The Company And Its GPUs Will Dominate AI Processors."" In a February 27, 2024 article entitled ""Qualcomm: Squeezing Competitors Out Of GenAI Smartphones At The Edge."" In this article, I more or less combine the focus of these reports on Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) and its chips used in both smartphones and PCs, enabling advanced on-device AI capabilities as well as AI in Data Centers. Data Centers ARM is steadily increasing its presence in the AI data center sector. Major cloud service providers Amazon.com, Inc.'s (AMZN) AWS, Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOG), (GOOGL) Google Cloud, Microsoft Corporation's (MSFT) Azure, and China's Alibaba Group Holding Limited's (BABA) Cloud, Tencent Holdings Limited's (OTCPK:TCEHY) Cloud. And Huawei Cloud. The projected compound annual growth rate (""CAGR"") for this market is 19.1%, growing from $20 billion in 2023 to $48 billion in 2028 according to The Information Networks' report Hot ICs: A Market Analysis of Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G, Automotive, and Memory Chips. A key factor, which will be described later in this article, is ARM's Neoverse platform, tailor-made for high-performance and scalable computing, providing ARM with advantages against Intel Corporation (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD). I estimate that by 2028, ARM's revenue in the AI data center market will reach $13 billion, representing 27% of the market, as shown in Table 1. The Information Network The processors for these companies in 2023 and 2024 are as follows in Table 2: The Information Network A key to the success of ARM at the data center is it offers an innovative alternative to traditional GPUs for data center workloads The Nvidia Grace CPU built on ARM's Neoverse architecture, is an alternative to traditional GPUs for data center workloads, excelling in high-performance computing (HPC) and AI tasks. By integrating the CPU with ARM Neoverse, the scalability makes it ideal for modern data centers. Unlike GPUs, which are power-intensive, the Grace CPU Superchip delivers complex computations with reduced power consumption, providing a balanced, efficient solution tailored for next-gen infrastructures. According to Nvidia Developer: ""The Nvidia Grace CPU is the first data center CPU developed by NVIDIA. Combining Nvidia expertise with Arm processors, on-chip fabrics, system-on-chip (SOC) design, and resilient high-bandwidth low-power memory technologies, the Grace CPU was built from the ground up to create the world's first superchip for computing. At the heart of the superchip, lies the NVLink Chip-2-Chip (C2C). The NVLink-C2C enables the Nvidia Grace CPU to communicate at 900 GB/s bidirectional bandwidth with another Nvidia Grace CPU or the NVIDIA Hopper GPU in the superchip. PC Edge AI Market Edge AI involves using artificial intelligence in an edge-computing environment. In this section, the edge device is the PC. By processing data at its source, PCs can make intelligent decisions quickly without uploading or downloading data from the cloud or data center. The PC edge AI market is set for outstanding growth, with an expected CAGR of about 20.3% from 2023 to 2028, as shown in Table 3, ARM's architecture, through partnerships with companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL), has demonstrated its ability to utilize its processors for PCs and laptops. Enabling devices to make smart decisions quickly, without the need to upload or download data. Apple's M1 and M2, employing a customized version of Armv8 chips and the Armv9 in the M3, epitomize the potential of ARM-based processors to challenge Intel and AMD in the PC market. I forecast ARM's revenue in this to rise from $1.5 billion in 2023 to $7 billion in 2028, representing a strong market penetration of ARM-based solutions in PC edge devices. The Information Network The processors for these companies in 2023 and 2024 are as follows in Table 4: The Information Network Smartphone Market While the smartphone market is more mature, it continues to grow with increasing AI integration for increased functionality of the device. As ARM processors are in over 95% of smartphones globally, I forecast that ARM's projected revenue from AI processors will grow from $100 billion in 2023 to $138 billion by 2028, as shown in Table 5. The top two smartphone companies, Apple and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTCPK:SSNLF), rely on ARM architecture for their processors. The Information Network The processors for these companies in 2023 and 2024 are as follows in Table 6: The Information Network Arm v9 Architecture The Armv9 architecture is central to ARM's strategy across multiple markets, including AI data centers, PC edge AI devices, and AI smartphones, offering substantial enhancements for ARM processors. The broad adoption of Armv9 by leading industry players underlines its critical role and growth potential from 2023 to 2028. Below are Armv9-based processors incorporated into the processors previously discussed: AI Data Center Market ARM Processors:  2023: Neoverse N1, N2. 2024: Neoverse V1, V2.  PC Edge AI Market ARM Processors:  2023: Apple M1, M2. 2024: Apple M2, M3.  Smartphone Market ARM Processors:  2023: High-end smartphones use the Cortex-X2 and Cortex-A710, which are based on Armv9. 2024: Upcoming Cortex-X3 and Cortex-A715 processors, part of the Armv9 family.  Integration in Competitor Products QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM):  2023: Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. Contains Cortex-X2 and Cortex-A710 cores that are based on Armv9. 2024: Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.Will include advanced Armv9 cores such as Cortex-X3 and Cortex-A715.  Samsung:  2023: Exynos 2200. Contains Cortex-X2 and Cortex-A710 cores that are built on Armv9. 2024: Exynos 2300. Updated Armv9 cores such as Cortex-X3 and Cortex-A715.  MediaTek:  2023: Dimensity 9000. Armv9 contains Cortex-X2 and Cortex-A710 cores. 2024: Dimensity 10000. Advanced Armv9 cores.  Investor Takeaway The AI market is on track for substantial growth across multiple segments, including AI data centers, PC edge AI devices, and AI smartphones. ARM's Neoverse platform, which includes processors such as Neoverse N1, N2, V1, and V2, provides important improvements in performance and efficiency for data centers and cloud computing, BofA anticipates that the transition to Arm's v9 architecture, which could potentially double or increase royalty rates by 4-5%, alongside a complete compute solution that might quadruple or boost rates by 8-10%, will be significant growth drivers.  Thus, I expect ARM will compete successfully with industry front-runners Intel and AMD. ARM's revenue in the AI data center market is projected to rise from $2 billion in 2023 to $13 billion in 2028, leading to an increased market share of 27%. In the PC edge AI market, ARM's relationship with Apple and the integration of Armv9 architecture in future M-series chips will be a catalyst for ARM's strong revenue growth from $1.5 billion in 2023 to $7 billion by 2028. In the smartphone market, ARM continues to dominate, powering over 95% of smartphones worldwide, with expected revenue growth from $100 billion in 2023 to $138 billion by 2028.  As noted above Qualcomm with its Snapdragon series, Samsung with its Exynos chips, and MediaTek with its Dimensity processors all use ARM's advanced cores. Investors and readers of this article should not consider an investment in ARM as an alternative to NVDA, as they are not direct competitors and instead, their business models are complementary as noted above with the Nvidia Grace CPU built on ARM's Neoverse architecture. Nvidia has also used ARM architecture in its Tegra processors.  Indeed, ARM's architecture has been centered on its use in mobile devices, but is increasingly found in data centers. However, the synergy in collaborative ventures between the two companies, manifested in the Nvidia Grace CPU serves as a trend in the industry between the two companies.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among today‚Äôs top movers is Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock, which is up 2.3% in early afternoon trading, hitting a fresh 52-week high in today‚Äôs session.This move comes as notable other AI stocks see sharp surges higher today amid analyst upgrades and improving sentiment across the board. Investors are awaiting congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell later this week, as well as additional economic data set to be released. For now, the market appears to have moved away from being interest rate and Fed-driven. Certain trends, such as AI, remain robust and are driving significant demand for certain stocks. Palantir is lucky to find itself among a key handful of companies driving the market higher today.Let‚Äôs dive into this broader trend and what to make of today‚Äôs price action.PLTR Stock Surges to Fresh 52-Week HighPalantir is certainly a company with plenty of momentum. The company‚Äôs various AI integrations and product launches have been a hit with its core government clientele as well as its booming enterprise business. The market is clearly pricing in plenty of growth from the latter group, judging by the company‚Äôs now very inflated valuation multiples.At the time of writing, Palantir trades at more than 230 times earnings and a price-sales ratio of 27 times. That‚Äôs extremely expensive. And while the company has produced a series of positive quarters in terms of earnings, it‚Äôs clear Palantir will need to step on the gas in terms of improving its margins to make these valuation multiples make sense for many investors.Some appear to be viewing Palantir as an AI beneficiary with the kind of operating leverage Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other pure-play AI stocks have shown. If that‚Äôs indeed the case, perhaps today‚Äôs valuation makes sense. But it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that momentum can work in both directions, making this recent rally one that could be worth watching closely for those looking to trade this stock or invest over relatively short time horizons.

huR5y4XAz9yTwHq,Seeking Alpha,google,Meta: Monetizing Next Round Of Capex Could Push Stock Higher (META),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4702997-meta-monetizing-next-round-of-capex-could-push-stock-higher,2024-07-08 15:06,2024-07-08 15:19,META,,"Galeanu Mihai Investment Thesis Despite rallying 56% YTD, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) remains relatively cheap among the ""Magnificent 7"" group. The company has heavily invested in Generative AI, resulting in successful AI monetization that has significantly boosted advertising revenue and margins. In my previous article from July 2023, I maintained a buy rating on the stock, due to its attractive valuation and substantial improvement in its FCF profile. Since then, the stock has achieved a 66% return, significantly ahead of the 21% return of the S&P 500. In 1Q FY2024, Meta achieved a 75% YoY growth in FCF, following over 100% YoY growth in the previous three quarters. Currently trading at 26.9x non-GAAP forward P/E, I believe META still has plenty of room to expand its valuation multiple. Therefore, I reiterate a buy rating on the stock, as another capex cycle in FY2024 is expected to further accelerate its growth trajectory. AI Features Significantly Boost Advertising Revenue   The company model Although META's light revenue guidance in 2Q might have disappointed some investors, the company's advertising revenue experienced a strong growth rebound over the past year. This growth trajectory is not only due to increased AI investments driving total ad impressions but also strong AI monetization across its family of apps. For example, Threads now reached over 175 million monthly users and has started focusing on ads monetization. In addition, the company updated a new version of Meta AI that is powered by the latest model, Llama 3, which helps users explore topics they're interested in more effectively. According to the 1Q FY2024 Press Release, total ad impressions grew by 20% YoY, while advertising revenue increased by 27% YoY, indicating that the average price per ad impression has risen, driven by AI monetization. The company reported that this growth rate was 6% YoY. I have created a chart below to demonstrate this trend. The company model As we can see from the chart, the growth rate in average revenue per ad impression turned positive in 4Q FY2023 and continued accelerating in 1Q FY2024. The management, in the 1Q FY2024 earnings call, highlighted two major factors that drive the revenue growth: delivering engaging experiences and effectively monetizing that engagement. With total ad impressions growth decelerating to 20% YoY in 1Q FY2024 from 26% in 1Q FY2023, I think META has shifted its focus towards monetizing engagement. By leveraging AI-driven features across its family of apps, it has significantly boosted monetization efficiency. META website According to the management, improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance, which is heavily supported by AI models such as using META Lattice. Recently, META released a research paper on Multi-token prediction models, which markedly reduce training times and enhance prediction quality compared to traditional Large Language Models. In other words, META will most likely continue to accelerate its advertising revenue growth using AI. Significant Expansion in Margins   The company model   It's encouraging to see that META not only has achieved a strong growth in its advertising revenue, but also has significantly improved its operating efficiency. As I mentioned in my last analysis of the 2Q FY2023 earnings results, Meta's ""Year of Efficiency"" has demonstrated tremendous success, with cost reduction resulting in a positive trend of margin expansion. This was largely driven by a significant cut in marketing and sales expense, showing 5 quarters of YoY decline since 1Q FY2023. Lastly, its Reality Labs segment continues to operate with a significant loss and shows no indication of improving margins in the near future. Elevated Capex with Improvement in FCF The company model Back in FY2022, META increased its capex by 68% YoY to build up AI infrastructure amidst the GenAI boom. This significant investment impacted its FCF, which declined by 50% YoY. Consequently, the stock plummeted nearly 73%, dropping from $331 to $91 in less than 11 months. However, a strong ROI subsequently boosted the company's fundamentals, as reflected in the FY2023 earnings results. Now, META is entering another capex cycle to strengthen its AI research and development. As shown in the chart, after a decline in capex growth over the past four quarters, the company raised its capex outlook during the recent earnings call. META now anticipates FY2024 capex to be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from the prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion. This implies a 40.5% YoY growth and a 380-bps YoY increase in ""capex as percentage of revenue"" in FY2024.   The company model However, I do not see this capex cycle creating a significant headwind in the FCF profile as we saw in the previous cycle, due to strong growth in OCF as shown in the chart above. Therefore, despite an anticipated 40% YoY increase in capex, I believe META's FCF margin in FY2024 will be significantly higher than the FY2022 level. Based on META's previous strong ROI track record, I believe that these AI investments will generate substantial returns in FY2025. Improvements in both engagement and ad performance should translate into revenue and earnings growth, which can further boost its valuation multiple, especially given its relatively cheap level among the ""Magnificent 7"" group. Valuation Seeking Alpha Let's look at META's valuation, since it's clear that the stock's current multiples are not lofty despite a significant rally in price this year. The company is currently trading at 29.3x GAAP P/E, which is higher than the 5-year average but still below the 10-year average. If we factor in its non-GAAP EPS consensus for the forward 12 months, the multiple will come down to 26.9x, which is 8.8% below the Nasdaq 100 index's forward P/E. According to Seeking Alpha, META's non-GAAP PEG forward is only 1.47x, which is even 2.9% below its 5-year average. This indicates that the market may have underappreciated META's earnings growth potential regarding its long-term GenAI growth story. Meanwhile, its forward P/OCF is currently at 17x, which is considered attractive, as META has significantly improved its OCF growth over the past quarters. Therefore, I believe the stock still has significant upside potential, as META currently ranks as the second least expensive stock after Google (GOOGL) among the ""Magnificent 7"" group based on non-GAAP P/E fwd metrics. Conclusion  In conclusion, META's heavy investment in GenAI during the previous cycle has not only improved its ad engagement but also successfully monetized that engagement, thereby boosting advertising revenue and margins. Despite another round of capex increases throughout FY2024, the company's FCF profile is anticipated to remain resilient, supported by strong growth in OCF. Despite a strong rally this year, the stock continues to trade at a relative cheap valuation compared to other peers. With attractive non-GAAP PEG fwd and P/OCF fwd multiple indicating potential for further expansion, I reiterate a buy rating on the stock. I believe META is well positioned to navigate through the next phase of capex and further accelerate growth.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

John Marshall, the firm's head of derivatives research, said in a note to clients that Wells Fargo looks like an options trade candidate ahead of its earnings report. He said that Goldman bank analyst Richard Ramsden is optimistic about Wells Fargo's outlook for the rest of year. ""Richard is constructive on WFC heading into 2Q24 earnings as he sees upside to 2024 NII guidance and earnings driven by an acceleration in loan/deposit growth along with potential asset cap lifting,"" the note said. Wells Fargo is set to release its latest earnings before the bell on Friday. Marshall suggested investors take a look at the call options with a $61 strike price that expire later this month. Call options give the holder the right to buy a stock at a pre-set strike price. They serve as a bet that the stock will rise above the strike, thus allowing the stock to be bought at a discount.

""WFC guided for 2024 NII (Net Interest Income) to decline by 7-9% [year over year] and Richard sees upside to this guidance as he expects NII to decline by only 7% on the back of deposit and loan growth rising in 2H24.

Reddit (/u/JacklJack)     Jul 8, 2024 at 3:30pm ET   comments         Rob Stumpf          By:  Rob Stumpf            CEO Elon Musk said just a month ago that there is no chance of a refreshed Model Y happening in 2024. Despite this claim, a user on Reddit spotted a Model Y with its front and rear under heavy cover just like the Model 3 Highland prior to its official reveal.  While we can't see what's under the covers on the front and rear, signs point to it being the Model Y's Juniper refresh. And if that's the case, it would make this spotting the first public appearance of the inevitable update.   Get Fully Charged   The Model Y's Inevitable Refresh  After months of teasing its domestic customers with a refreshed Model 3, Tesla finally released the Model 3 Highland update stateside earlier this year. The Model Y ""Juniper"" refresh should follow, although Tesla has repeatedly noted that the facelifted crossover won't debut in the U.S. any time in 2024.    According to the poster, the concealed car was spotted during a run around the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California‚Äîaround 24 miles away from the Tesla Design Studio in Hawthorne. The poster says that the car was being guarded and when they peeked inside, ""everything [was] covered.""        Tesla Model Y Juniper Spy Photo While we don't know what's lurking underneath the covers, it's likely that the Model Y is getting a similar refresh to the Model 3. The Model 3 ""Highland"" refresh¬†featured a revised front and rear fascia¬†with new headlights and tail lights. It also received a reworked interior with ventilated seats, new interior accent lighting, a stalkless steering column, a thinner infotainment display bezel, and more. Plus, the car's reworked keyless entry system gained ultra wideband capabilities. Historically, the Model 3 and Model Y share 76% of their parts, which Tesla is unlikely to deviate from given its mission to cut costs wherever possible.¬†  Exactly when the Model Y Juniper refresh will launch is still an unknown. When Tesla e-celebrity Sawyer Merritt brought attention to the refresh via a subscription-limited post on X, Musk reportedly chimed in asking him to stop speculating.      ""There is no new Model Y this year. Please stop hinting that there is, as it damages our sales of the current version,"" wrote Musk.

Keep in mind that from the first time that the Model 3 Highland was spotted under camo to its unveiling in China took all of 10 months. It was officially revealed at the end of the second quarter of 2023. If the upgraded Model Y is developed on a similar timeline, Tesla may aim to unveil it in Q2 2025. While the¬†Model Y was the best-selling vehicle in the world last year,¬†sales are¬†down slightly this year. A fresher model in showrooms could help Tesla stem the bleeding, and hold onto its crown.

Rivian Automotive (RIVN 5.00%) and Polestar Automotive (PSNY -8.86%) followed right along -- despite Polestar getting some bad news to start off the day.As of 12:05 p.m. ET, both Lucid and Rivian are up 3.9%, while Polestar is against all odds edging them both out with a 4.3% gain.Lucid's good newsStarting with the best news of the day, Lucid announced this morning that it produced 2,110 cars in Q2 2024 -- and delivered 2,394. This means Lucid produced fewer cars this year than last (Q2 2023 production was 2,173 vehicles), but delivered a lot more EVs than a year ago. Q2 2023 deliveries were only 1,404. This seems pretty impressive -- 70% year-over-year sales growth.How did Lucid deliver more cars than it produced? Simply put, Lucid worked down some of its inventory -- which also sounds like good news, both for Lucid itself, which dug itself out of a bit of a hole, and potentially also for Rivian and Polestar, if it means demand for EVs in general is perking back up.Polestar's bad newsBut does Lucid's good news bode well for its electric vehicle-manufacturing peers? Actually, it might. Last week, Polestar announced rapid growth in its own EV deliveries between Q1 and Q2, with sequential growth of 80% to ""approximately 13,000"" electric cars delivered. Management said the U.S., Swedish, Norwegian, and German markets in particular all showed ""strong momentum,"" with a ""positive impact on inventory levels and cash flow.""Problem is, even with strong sales growth, investment bank Citigroup warned today that Polestar's free cash flow will remain negative, and that U.S. tariffs and falling EV prices aren't helping matters much. Citi cut its price target on Polestar to $1.10 per share. Seeing as Lucid and Rivian are also continuing to burn cash, I'd hesitate to chase any of these EV stocks higher until they're more clearly on a path to profits.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zeekr     Jul 8, 2024 at 4:00pm ET   comments         Kevin Williams          By:  Kevin Williams         The automotive industry has called every compact and aspirational premium electric crossover a ""Model Y fighter"" for the past five years. Many brands have tried to challenge Tesla, and some have even had modest success. But it‚Äôs not that easy to dethrone the best-selling vehicle in the world.¬† That‚Äôs not going to stop plenty of brands from trying again, though. This time it's Zeekr coming at Tesla with a not-officially-named crossover still referred to by its codename, the CX1E. Given Zeekr‚Äôs success over the past year, this crossover could be the model that could put the screws to the Model Y in certain markets.    Get Fully Charged   U.S. and European Union Implement Chinese Car Tariffs  The U.S. is not the only place implementing tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. Although not as high as the U.S's 100% tariff, the EU has placed a 19.9% tariff on Geely models made in China and shipped to Europe. That goes on top of the EU's standard 10% tariff on imported cars.    The CX1E is part of the brand‚Äôs push to introduce seven models by 2026. Some are likely to stay China-only exclusives like the¬†minivan-shaped Zeekr Mix. But, others will venture outside of China and do battle in the markets where Zeekr is expanding, like Mexico, South Korea and a growing number of countries in Western Europe. From what we can see, the CX1E looks like an SUV version of the Zeekr 007 sedan I recently reviewed. The two have a similarly shaped lightbar at the front. At the rear, the taillight bar is similarly thin, with two brake and reverse lights integrated near the bottom of the bumper cover. Just like the 007, the rear door shut line terminates with the edge of the rear wheel opening. There‚Äôs even what looks to be a LiDAR sensor just above the top of the windshield, just like the higher-trimmed versions of the Zeekr 007.    Gallery: Zeekr CX1E Teaser  5 Photos    Zeekr CX1E Front 3/4       Zeekr   Zeekr CX1E Front 3/4     Zeekr CX1E Front Building       Zeekr   Zeekr CX1E Front Building    Zeekr CX1E Front Right      Zeekr   Zeekr CX1E Front Right      Zeekr CX1E Profile      Zeekr   Zeekr CX1E Profile    Zeekr CX1E Rear      Zeekr   Zeekr CX1E Rear     Thus, we can logically assume that this CX1E will use the same SEA (Sustainable Experience Architecture) as the Zeekr 007. This could mean it will also get a partially megacast chassis and well over 600 horsepower. It also means that the CX1E would have the same 800-volt-class architecture, too. In the 007, this 800-volt architecture allows a peak DC fast-charging rate of 500 kW. If the CX1E comes with the same 75 kWh battery, it could zip from 10-80% in about twelve minutes. That‚Äôs a pretty big upgrade over the Tesla Model Y, which takes over 30 minutes to go from 10-80%.   Get the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox.

The chances of the CX1E or any Zeekr product entering the U.S. aren‚Äôt as high as they were, say, six months ago. But, because Zeekr is a Geely brand, and is responsible for a lot of its vehicle development, there‚Äôs a very real chance that we will see the guts of the CX1E in a future Volvo or Polestar. If it‚Äôs sized right, price well and made in a country that won‚Äôt be subject to a profitability-ruining tariff, a Volvo-ized Zeekr CX1E could make a stellar XC60 replacement. A Zeekr representative said that the official launch name and specifications will be released at a later date.  Contact the author:¬†kevin.williams@insideevs.com.

Michael Jones The last 18 months have seen large √¢¬Ä¬úmoney center√¢¬Ä¬ù banks continue to outperform smaller regional banks, as these larger banks can generally rely on more stable, lower cost funding, large sources of non-interest income, and flights to quality among more nervous customers. To that end, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has continued to perform since my last update, with an 18% move outdoing not only smaller regional banks but also large banks as well (though not quite as good as others like JPMorgan (JPM)). At this point in the cycle, though, I√¢¬Ä¬ôve cooled some on Bank of America. This isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt because of any flaw in this business, but rather the fact that Street expectations seem to have caught up to my own and the shares look much closer to fair value now √¢¬Ä¬ì an issue I noted with PNC Financial (PNC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) in recent articles (here and here) about those two. Do keep in mind, though, that while owning relatively cheaper/undervalued stocks can drive short-term outperformance, there√¢¬Ä¬ôs nothing wrong with holding onto shares of a well-run business trading at or near fair value, as well-run businesses have a knack for outperforming expectations over time. This Upcoming Quarter May Be The Bottom  Bank of America hasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt been doing too badly of late with respect to quarterly earnings reports √¢¬Ä¬ì each of the five quarters since my last article has seen the bank exceed sell-side EPS expectations, and the last quarter saw a respective pre-provision profit beat (a $0.06/share beat versus an overall $0.09/share operating EPS beat). The bank has done well due in no small part to less pressure on net interest margin from funding (helped by a sizable pool of effectively free funds) and tight expense management, as well as healthy trends in capital markets (both banking and trading). I do expect a modest reversal of some of these trends in Q2√¢¬Ä¬ô24. Although Bank of America has been the biggest beneficiary of free funding among its group, I expect some funding pressures and deposit pressures from tax-related outflows to lead to a trough in net interest income and net margin in the quarter, with a NIM around 1.92% or 1.93%. The good news is that this is widely-expect and given BAC√¢¬Ä¬ôs operating history, I won√¢¬Ä¬ôt be surprised if there√¢¬Ä¬ôs a slight beat at the NIM line. Fee income could perhaps drive some upside. I expect a sequential decline in trading, but Jefferies (JEF) did pretty well for the quarter and Bank of America has been surprising to the good here recently. Banking could also be a source of upside, as Jefferies saw 9% sequential growth here and issuance and advisory markets are picking up after a weak 2023. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm not expecting much to come from expenses, as BAC already runs a tight ship, but the bank could squeeze out a penny or two of upside here. All told, I think BAC could deliver something around $9.2B or $9.3B in pre-provision profits versus expectations closer to $9.0B-$9.1B (good for around $0.02 to $0.03/share of upside). I√¢¬Ä¬ôm not expecting much good news in lending. Loan growth has continued to slow, with cards up 7% year-over-year in the quarter and C&I lending up less than 2%. BAC had already been lagging on card loan growth and C&I, and I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt expect either to significantly outperform, though the simple fact that card loan growth is so much stronger than other categories should drive better growth here than for banks like PNC and Truist (TFC). And From There?  A lot of what happens next for banks like BAC will be determined by what the Fed does with rates over the next six to 12 months. Unfortunately, as a close friend of mine who heads up a major CRE√¢¬Ä¬ôs economic research effort likes to say, the interest rate forecasting hall of fame is empty for a reason. In other words, your guess is as good as mine, though I do think weaker macroeconomic conditions are likely to put more pressure on prices and coax the Fed to start cutting. As an asset-sensitive bank, declining rates aren√¢¬Ä¬ôt likely to help BAC as much as some banks, but I do expect the bank to see a tailwind from repricing its loan and securities books at higher rates, as well as a benefit from lower deposit costs. I also expect BAC to benefit from improving loan demand in 2025 and 2026, and particularly on the consumer side. I also expect good growth from fee-based businesses. Card fees should reaccelerate as the economy recovers, and I expect Bank of America to leverage more of its past investments into digital payment tech to generate more revenue here. I also expect stronger results from trading and banking to drive growth; while Wells Fargo is also talking about growing these business lines, Bank of America has been performing quite well on a consistent basis, and I think it will continue to do so in the next few years. While I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt see as much room to cut costs here as at other banks, the fact that the efficiency ratio is already quite competitive should drive stronger operating leverage as revenue√¢¬Ä¬ôs recover, as the bank will need to spend less to support that growth. I see all of the above leading to a high-single-digit two-year pre-provision profit growth rate that should be on the higher end of its comp group. Bank of America Still Has A Runway For Growth  Thematically, I think there are multiple growth targets and opportunities to monitor over the next three to five years. For a bank with double-digit share of national deposits, Bank of America still punches under its weight in wealth management with something in the neighborhood of 5% market share. Management has made it clear at recent sell-side presentations that this is a business they want to grow, but I want to hear more about the √¢¬Ä¬úhow√¢¬Ä¬ù √¢¬Ä¬ì BAC management has been very focused on expenses in this area, and I think the bank may need to invest a little more (whether that√¢¬Ä¬ôs technology, personnel, or marketing, or all of the above) to drive better results. I also see opportunities to grow the cards and mortgage businesses. As the #5 card issuer, Bank of America could be a bigger force than it is, and I think there are opportunities to grow this business without necessarily compromising credit quality. Likewise with mortgages, where management has ceded some share but could be poised to gain as non-bank competitors will still have funding cost disadvantages. Last and not least, there are still opportunities to grow the core deposit business. Management wants to be #1 or #2 in its 30 largest markets and they still have six left to go. Likewise, management wants to be in 93 of the top 100 markets by 2026, which means adding branches in nine more markets over the next couple of years. As far as credit quality goes, and apologies for the abrupt segue, I√¢¬Ä¬ôm not too concerned. Nothing in Bank of America√¢¬Ä¬ôs recent charge-off, non-performing loan, or criticized loan numbers suggests a brewing problem. While the company does have a large office loan portfolio in absolute terms, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs less than 2% of overall loans and geographically diversified. What√¢¬Ä¬ôs more, it will take years for the office credit situation to play out (that√¢¬Ä¬ôs true of the whole banking sector, not just BAC). The Outlook With ample capital to fund both future growth and capital returns to shareholders, I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt see many compromises necessary between the two. A higher-for-longer rate cycle has negatively impacted my earnings expectations for FY√¢¬Ä¬ô24 and FY√¢¬Ä¬ô25 (FY√¢¬Ä¬ô23 earnings were about 1.5% better than I√¢¬Ä¬ôd modeled), but I do still expect long-term core earnings growth in the neighborhood of 4% and distributions growth (dividends and buybacks) closer to 8%. Discounting the core earnings back, I get to a fair value in the low-to-mid-$40√¢¬Ä¬ôs. I get a similar fair value with an 11.4x multiple to my 2025 EPS estimate ($3.67 vs. Street $3.62) and a 1.65x P/TBV multiple based on a ROTCE near 14%. The Bottom Line  Perhaps Bank of America can generate even more positive operating leverage than I expect, and/or grow loans, deposits, and capital markets even more than I expect in the coming years. As is, though, while I like Bank of America quite a lot and still consider it a good stock to hold, I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt see a level of undervaluation that would lead me to prefer it over other names like JPMorgan or PNC at this point.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

The world's largest cryptocurrency has fallen over the past 24 hours amid lingering worries regarding potential large sales from former customers of failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and Germany.According to one analyst, the worries regarding Mt. Gox may be more relevant to Bitcoin Cash.Ethereum-based project Golem has also sent more than $100 million worth of ether to exchanges over the past month and still has hundreds of millions of dollars more worth in its treasury. Bitcoin (BTC) traded above $56,000 Monday afternoon, sliding amid movements of funds on the blockchain by addresses connected to failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. Disbursements of bitcoin and bitcoin cash to former customers of the exchange began last week. Some observers believe the supply is weighing on prices, though others say the long-expected event is already priced into the market. Peter Chung, Presto Labs Head of Research, said bitcoin cash is more likely to be affected. Some investors, meanwhile, worried about Germany's selling of bitcoin originally seized by the German Federal Criminal Police Office from piracy website Movie2k.to. According to Arkham Intelligence, Germany still possesses 26,318 BTC valued at $1.4 billion, but has sent more than half of the nearly 50,000 bitcoin it had seized out of its Bitcoin address. After steadily sending out bitcoin starting in June, the German authorities also sent a significant amount of bitcoin to the exchanges on Monday. Bitcoin was recently down more than 1% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk. Selling pressure from Mt. Gox customers and the German government may be seen as a buying opportunity, according to digital asset manager CoinShares, which said global digital asset investment products saw $441 million of inflows last week. Ether (ETH) is also experiencing a potential liquidation of a large holder in the form of Ethereum-based decentralized application Golem, which raised more than 800,000 ether in an initial coin offering in 2016. According to Arkham Intelligence, Golem has already sent more than $100 million worth of ether to exchanges over the past 30 days, and the project still has roughly $388 million worth of ether at its disposal.

wzSrqC3hNnwNm9c,USA Today,bing,"Ranking the 10 greatest Eddie Murphy film performances, including Axel Foley",https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/10-greatest-eddie-murphy-film-performances-axel-foley,2024-07-08 16:06,2024-07-08 16:14,COP,,"Outside of Tom Cruise, there may not be a greater movie star in the history of the medium than Eddie Murphy. Forging his career as the all-time Saturday Night Live cast member and one of the greatest stand-up comedians ever, Murphy exploded on the film scene with 1982‚Äôs 48 Hrs. and never looked back. Films like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop made him one of the most reliable box office performers, and 2006‚Äôs Dreamgirls fulfilled the vision of him being an all-encompassing actor who could reach for the highest highs of charisma and the fiercest depths of drama. While not all of Murphy‚Äôs films have worked out and his recent run less successful than his heyday, 2019‚Äôs Dolemite Is My Name proved that nobody quite does it like he does when he‚Äôs locked in. With the long-awaited fourth installment of Beverly Hills Cop now playing on Netflix, let‚Äôs go back into Murphy‚Äôs multi-decade career and rank his best performances (excluding his iconic stand-up films). 5 Very Honorable Mentions Mushu, Mulan Thomas Jefferson Johnson, The Distinguished GentlemanVernest ‚ÄúQuick‚Äù Brown, Harlem NightsHenry Joseph Church, Mr. Church Dr. John Dolittle, the Dr. Dolittle franchise 10. Kit Ramsey/Jiffrenson ""Jiff"" Ramsey, Bowfinger Playing opposite Steve Martin in a dream pairing for Frank Oz‚Äôs show business satire, Murphy plays both a delightful parody of an A-list diva and one of his most enjoyably dorky creations to date in a pair of twin brothers caught up in Martin‚Äôs film production. The film relies heavily on the chemistry Murphy and Martin have together, and the former‚Äôs uncanny ability to disappear into multiple roles blended well with the Hollywood shenanigans. 9. Billy Ray Valentine, Trading Places A year after asserting himself as a major big screen talent in 48 Hours, Murphy got the chance to play opposite a red-hot Dan Aykroyd and a rising Jamie Lee Curtis in the beloved rags-to-riches comedy that also serves as an astute critique of the Wall Street class. Murphy gets plenty of great material to translate some of his undeniable Saturday Night Live charm into Valentine as director John Landis is probably the most attune to the variety format that Murphy worked with in his career.8. Marcus Graham, Boomerang A fiercely underrated romantic comedy that established Murphy as not only a generational comedic actor but a suave leading man in the genre, Boomerang felt a bit ahead of its time. The film feels like one of Judd Apatow‚Äôs 2000s raunchy romantic comedies set against the backdrop of early 1990s advertising, and Murphy‚Äôs charisma shines here in obvious and subtle ways. It‚Äôs probably the most underappreciated film of his filmography and the performance that really cemented his range. 7. Multiple characters, the Coming to America movies Murphy was already a bona fide star when he took on his very first multi-character project with Coming to America, the kind of high-concept blockbuster comedy we don‚Äôt really get any longer. Reuniting with Landis, Murphy stretches his legs out with four different characters of differing comedic tones and intensities, including Prince Akeem and the scene-stealing Randy Watson. While the film‚Äôs 2021 sequel didn‚Äôt quite reach the heights of the classic 1986 original, Murphy‚Äôs clear command over what each of these characters needed to get laughs remains impressive. 6. Reggie Hammond, 48 Hrs.  Murphy‚Äôs firs movie was a cannonball in terms of its splash radius to make him into a true-blue movie star. Immediately popping on screen opposite Nick Nolte in Walter Hill‚Äôs engrossing-yet-dated 48 Hrs., Murphy proved why he was such a fireball of a talent by going toe-to-toe with an established actor in Nolte and nailing whatever material was headed his way. Of course, Axel Foley was two years later and made him a bankable superstar, but nothing is possible without Hammond. His singular comedic timing and magnetic scene presence was clear right away. He was special. 5. Axel Foley, the Beverly Hills Cop franchise Murphy became a global movie star with Beverly Hills Cop. As hard as it is to believe with the modern box office, this buddy cop movie that sent Murphy‚Äôs Detroit cop Axel Foley to Beverly Hills to investigate a murder was an instant sensation and topped the 1984 box office. It‚Äôs hard to believe that Sylvester Stallone almost played the lead in this film, because it‚Äôs almost destiny that Murphy found such a perfect character in Foley to show his scream-funny comedic chops and his laser-focused intensity as an actor. The franchise peaked with its first installment, but it‚Äôs one of the greatest comedies of all time for a reason. Murphy used a pretty well-worn format for its time as his launchpad for superstardom, also delivering one of his great performances in the process. 4. Donkey, the Shrek franchiseThree years after lending his voice to Disney‚Äôs Mulan as the adorable dragon Mushu, Murphy delivered what really may be the greatest voice acting role of the 21st century with Donkey in the groundbreaking Shrek. A major leap for computer animation and in irreverent storytelling for family audiences, Shrek‚Äòs virtues are well-litigated. However, the movie doesn‚Äôt work without Murphy hitting homer after homer with his vocal performance of Donkey, the film‚Äôs breakout character. Just close your eyes and imagine Murphy saying ‚ÄúAnd in the morning, I‚Äôm making waffles!‚Äù in Donkey‚Äôs voice, or ‚ÄúWow, let‚Äôs do that again!‚Äù after Donkey and Shrek watch the bizarre Duloc intro play. Murphy gave it his all here, as it really is one of his greatest achievements as an actor. To pull off a performance so sweet, so gut-bustlingly annoying, so instantly memorable as an animated sidekick in a risky DreamWorks movie back when CGI was still finding itself‚Ä¶ he deserved an Oscar. 3. Rudy Ray Moore, Dolemite Is My Name The great performance of Murphy‚Äôs recent career comes with his passion project Dolemite Is My Name where he finally got the chance to play legendary entertainer Rudy Ray Moore. Blending his dramatic chops with his commanding approach to comedy, Murphy is simply breathtaking when he really dives into the headrush of Moore‚Äôs presentation. He‚Äôs firing on all cylinders here, giving Moore an empathetic streak in the making of Dolemite while never letting up on his personal spark. 2. James ""Thunder"" Early, Dreamgirls Murphy‚Äôs outrageous showmanship was never more evident than with the film adaptation of Dreamgirls, bringing R&B/soul singer Jimmy ‚ÄúThunder‚Äù Early to life with the electricity of a power plant and the relentlessness of a fast-moving shark. It‚Äôs his greatest dramatic role, proving the unreal depths in which he could mine his characters to their core. Losing out on the Best Supporting Actor Oscar to Alan Arkin in Little Miss Sunshine remains one of the more frustrating Academy missteps, as great as Arkin was in that film. Early gave Murphy the chance to expand on every single facet of his generational talent, from show-stopping music numbers to devastating moments of crushing vulnerability. We‚Äôre left with one of the greatest supporting turns of the 2000s and what may be the highlight of Murphy‚Äôs career ‚Ä¶ if it weren‚Äôt for the Klumps. 1. Multiple characters, the Nutty Professor franchiseMurphy recently told The New York Times that his multi-character marathon The Nutty Professor as his best cumulative performance, saying that he cannot think of an actor who could‚Äôve pulled the film off. We‚Äôre inclined to agree. Playing a whopping eight different characters, including multiple members of the Klump family and the nefarious Buddy Love, Murphy absolutely goes bonkers with his ability to inhabit multiple personas in one movie. Unless you‚Äôve got a thing against flatulence jokes, this is one of the funniest movies of the 1990s and an otherworldly achievement for comedic performance. Sure, the film didn‚Äôt get the best reception when it came out, but Murphy‚Äôs grandest accomplishment is bringing so many characters to life with stunning detail without sacrificing his most special asset, his ability to get you rolling in your seat. He‚Äôs the funniest man to ever life, and regardless of how you feel about these movies, no project ever gave him a better platform to shine. The dinner table scene with all of the Klump family is, no joke, the funniest moment in film history.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
bgnBbQQeImeBWhr,Seeking Alpha,google,Tesla: Is Valuation A Blind Spot For Investors? (NASDAQ:TSLA),https://seekingalpha.com/article/4703009-tesla-is-valuation-a-blind-spot-for-investors,2024-07-08 16:05,2024-07-08 16:16,TSLA,,"baileystock This write-up is not meant to discount the huge amount of success Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has seen with CEO Elon Musk at the helm over the last 20 or so years. Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs growth has been astronomical. In the last 10 years alone, the company has increased revenues by more than 29x (a 41% CAGR) and EBITDA by almost 300x (77% CAGR)! And shareholders have been rewarded √¢¬Ä¬ì over the same period TSLA stock has appreciated by more than +1,500%, while the S&P 500 (SP500) returned just over +230%. TSLA Historical Fundamentals & Performance vs. SPY (L10Y) (Koyfin) It√¢¬Ä¬ôs difficult to argue with this level of success. And that√¢¬Ä¬ôs not what we√¢¬Ä¬ôre trying to do here.    I've always believed that nothing was worth an infinite price.  - Charlie Munger.  Our issue is more about the level of future success we think the market is currently pricing in. In light of Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs capital-intensive business model, intensifying competition in the market for electric vehicles, or EVs, and an evolving and inherently unpredictable regulatory environment, we find it challenging to justify Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs current valuation. Couple this with the fact that Tesla's historical guidance on its product pipeline and the rollout of new technologies hasn't always been accurate, making it difficult to predict when these initiatives might actually start driving growth in sales and earnings. As such, we're initiating coverage on TSLA with a Sell rating. If we haven√¢¬Ä¬ôt lost all the Tesla bulls yet, humor us as we attempt to justify our views on the stock. Capital Intensity Tesla is a capital-intensive business. Building new facilities, increasing battery production, expanding its charger network, and delivering more and more cars, are all key to Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs growth and require significant capital investment. To put Tesla's capital requirements into perspective, let's compare its capital intensity to a few other businesses:  BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDY): Chinese competitor in the BEV space. Nvidia (NVDA): A high-growth tech company benefiting from similar AI-related tailwinds. Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY): A mature automaker with the second-largest global EV market share.  TSLA's Capital Intensity (Koyfin) At the beginning of the year, Musk mentioned that he expects CapEx to exceed $10bn in 2024 and to range from $8-10bn for each of the next two fiscal years. This amounts to a 5.5-7x increase versus 5 years ago. While high-growth businesses command higher valuations, we think the market might be overlooking Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs capital intensity. Businesses with greater capital intensity tend to trade at lower multiples since they have to commit a greater percentage of capital to investments in fixed assets, limiting their financial flexibility. Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs growth costs a lot of money to fund. And while the company should benefit from economies of scale as it grows, we think it will become increasingly difficult to achieve the kind of growth they√¢¬Ä¬ôve experienced in the past. As competition in the EV market heats up, and demand for EVs cools off, where does that leave Tesla? Musk has been slashing prices, and margins are under pressure as a result. In the last year and a half, Tesla's operating margin has declined from 17.2% to 5.5%. Intensifying Competition As the EV market matures, Tesla faces an increasingly crowded and competitive landscape, challenging Tesla's market dominance and future growth prospects. The EV market is becoming saturated with established automakers like Ford (F), General Motors (GM), Volkswagen, and Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF), all of which are investing heavily in EV development and either currently offer or plan to offer EVs at comparable or more competitive price points relative to Tesla. But in the US, Tesla remains king. With more than 140k cars sold in 1Q24, Tesla far outsold the #2 selling EV maker in the US during the quarter, with Hyundai selling just under 23k EVs. However, Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD, NIO (NIO), XPeng (XPEV), and Li Auto (LI) are rapidly expanding their global reach, offering competitive models with advanced technology, long-range capabilities, and attractive price points.   BYD: As the leading EV manufacturer in China with more than 300k EVs sold in 1Q24, BYD boasts a diverse product portfolio, including the Seal sedan, which rivals Tesla's Model 3 in terms of performance and features, but at a slightly lower price point (in Australia where new tariffs aren't a factor, BYD's 2024 Seal Premium retails at $58,798 vs. $61,900 for the 2024 Tesla Model 3).  NIO: Known for its premium electric SUVs, the company recently unveiled its new lower-priced brand Onvo, which directly competes with Tesla's Model Y. In China, prices for NIO's new Onvo L60 SUV will start at 219,900 yuan, roughly 12% lower than Tesla's Model Y (which starts at 249,900 yuan). NIO's unique battery-swapping technology further differentiates the company's offering, though it isn't mainstream yet.  XPeng: With its emphasis on technology and autonomous driving capabilities, XPeng has gained traction with models like the P7 sedan and G3 SUV, as the company delivered 21,821 vehicles in 1Q24. The company's advanced driver-assistance systems and innovative features like in-car voice control and smart parking assist aim to rival Tesla on tech.  Li Auto: Focusing on extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), Li Auto's Li ONE model offers a solution for range anxiety concerns in regions with limited charging infrastructure. Li Auto boasts strong unit economics, a solid financial position, and significant growth potential in the expanding Chinese EV market, particularly in the increasingly popular EREV segment.  The success of these companies in China, the world's largest EV market, demonstrates their potential to disrupt the global EV landscape (we√¢¬Ä¬ôll touch on tariffs later). In 2023, China accounted for nearly 60% of global EV sales, with Chinese brands capturing 81% of domestic EV sales. But can anyone compete with Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs Robotaxi/Cybercab? And will its rollout result in another step function change in Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs growth trajectory? Product Pipeline & Timing Uncertainty In our view, Tesla's ambitious product pipeline, a driving force behind its growth narrative, is called into question by the company's less-than-stellar history of overpromising and underdelivering. While Musk's vision has been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of innovation, the gap between ambition and reality can be pretty wide. A few noteworthy examples:   Battery Range: In 2015, Tesla claimed it would achieve a 1,000 km (621 miles) battery range within a few years. Currently, the longest range achieved by a Tesla is about 560 miles. While battery technology continues to improve, the discrepancy between the initial projection and current reality highlights the challenges of achieving such breakthroughs. While Tesla continues to iterate on battery technology, competitors like Lucid, Chevrolet, and Mercedes have been catching up.  Full Self-Driving (""FSD""): Tesla's 2016 prediction of coast-to-coast fully autonomous driving by 2018 remains unfulfilled. Tesla's progress in FSD has been slower than anticipated, and rival Mercedes recently became the first automaker to bring Level 3 autonomous vehicles to the US with its EQS. But it seems like Tesla is making some progress on this front. In April, Baidu (BIDU) announced an agreement with Tesla to upgrade the EV's mapping software in the China - a key step toward rolling out FSD in the country. And while other of Tesla's competitors have been testing their own fully autonomous driving solutions, progress has been mixed. GM's Cruise has faced setbacks, while Waymo is beginning to test its driverless cars in new markets.  Robotaxis: First mentioned in 2019, with Tesla predicting a 2020 launch, the company's robotaxi concept is still in its infancy. While a prototype unveiling is planned for next month, concrete details about the vehicle's capabilities, regulatory approval process, and deployment timeline are scarce.  Musk's bold vision has undoubtedly propelled Tesla forward, but we've seen how long it can take to achieve some of his goals. As such, we think the company's valuation should reflect a longer, more realistic timeline to execute on these key growth initiatives. Regulatory Risks In addition to the increasing level of spending required to achieve Musk√¢¬Ä¬ôs lofty goals, intensifying competition in EVs, and the company's history of overpromising and underdelivering, Tesla also faces a number of regulatory risks. Countries are implementing stricter emission standards and offering incentives to promote EV adoption. While these policies generally benefit Tesla, changes in these regulations could disrupt Tesla's production plans and sales growth. For example, the phase-out of EV tax credits would likely negatively impact demand for EVs. Research by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that for every $1,000 decrease in EV tax credits, there is a 2.6% decrease in sales, illustrating the direct relationship between incentives and consumer behavior. And while US and EU tariffs on Chinese-made EVs might help Tesla remain competitive outside of China, China is the largest EV market in the world by far, so Tesla needs to be competitive there too. Global BEV Market Share (Tesla's 1Q24 Share Holder Deck) According to research from Counterpoint, China is expected to hold more than 50% market share of global BEV sales until 2027 and Chinese BEV sales are projected to exceed the combined sales of North America and Europe by 2030. Over the last 5 years, Tesla√¢¬Ä¬ôs revenue from China has grown at a clip of nearly 50%. But last year that growth slowed to 20%. BYD reported sales growth of more than 40% in 2023. TSLA China Revenue (FinChat.io)BYD Total Revenue Growth (FinChat.io) EVs also face evolving safety regulations. Tesla's advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technology are under intense scrutiny. The NHTSA has opened several investigations into Tesla crashes involving Autopilot. In 2021, the DOJ launched a criminal investigation into Tesla's claims about its self-driving capabilities. According to Reuters, the investigation is ongoing and focused on whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles√¢¬Ä¬ô self-driving capabilities. Additionally, Tesla's energy generation and storage businesses are subject to evolving environmental regulations regarding the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing processes, and waste disposal. Compliance with these regulations can be costly, and any violations can result in fines, penalties, or reputational damage. Valuation Tesla stock closed at a split-adjusted all-time high of about $410 on November 4th, 2021. Since then, the stock is down about -40%, currently trading around $250. TSLA 3-Year Drawdown (FinChat.io) Despite this drawdown, according to Wall Street consensus estimates, Tesla still trades at about 43x NTM EV/EBITDA or 8x NTM EV/S, which in all fairness is right around the 5-year average for the stock. TSLA Valuation (Koyfin) Let's see how Tesla's multiple stacks up with competitors. TSLA EV/Sales (NTM) vs. Peers (Koyfin) Somewhat unsurprisingly, TSLA trades at a significant premium to other domestic and international EV makers. However, it's important to look at valuation multiples alongside growth to help contextualize these figures. TSLA Rolling 3-Year Revenue CAGR vs. Peers (FinChat.io) As we mentioned earlier, Tesla's growth has been astronomical, leading to the company's optically high valuation. However, on a 3-year revenue CAGR basis, BYD's growth surpassed Tesla's in FY 2023, yet BYD trades at less than 1x EV/NTM Sales while Tesla trades at almost 8x. But on TSLA's last earnings call, Musk said: But I think Cathy Wood said it best, like really, we should be thought of as an AI or robotics company. If you value Tesla as just like an auto company, you just have to √¢¬Ä¬ì fundamentally, it's just the wrong framework and it will come to be. So let's look at TSLA's valuation relative to a few AI and robotics companies (including companies like Nvidia, which are direct beneficiaries of the growth tailwinds in AI). TSLA Valuation vs. AI and Robotics Companies (Koyfin) TSLA's valuation looks relatively less expensive compared to these types of businesses. And for a company that's achieved Tesla's level of historical growth, its current multiple might not seem excessive at first glance. However, the critical question is whether Tesla can maintain a similar growth trajectory going forward. How much needs to go right for Tesla's current valuation to make sense? And is there any real margin of safety for investors at these levels? To answer these questions, we need to make some assumptions about Tesla's future performance: 1) Exit Multiple: While Tesla currently trades at an EBITDA multiple in the 40s, we'll use a more conservative exit multiple of 25x for our 5-year forward estimate. This is higher than the 18x multiple projected by the few analysts with 2028 estimates, but still provides room for Tesla to outperform expectations. TSLA Analyst Estimates (Koyfin) 2) Growth Rate: Tesla has compounded EBITDA at a CAGR of 44% over the past 5 years. To be conservative, we'll assume a 35% EBITDA CAGR through FY 2028, which is still well above the consensus estimate of ~20%. TSLA EBITDA (Koyfin) 3) Capital Structure: We'll assume net debt remains flat from current levels and factor in ~7% annual dilution, in line with Tesla's historical average. TSLA % Change in Weighted Avg. Shares Outstanding (Koyfin) Using these optimistic assumptions, our model suggests that TSLA currently trades at a ~5% 5-year forward IRR. TSLA IRR Model (Koyfin; FV Capital Analysis) We believe these assumptions may prove overly optimistic given the challenges we've discussed throughout this analysis. But even if we're directionally correct, Tesla's stock doesn't appear to offer an attractive risk-adjusted return at current levels, in our view. Upside Risks Despite the challenges we see Tesla facing, there are several potential upside risks that could impact our thesis for the stock:  Successful execution of the robotaxi initiative: If Tesla can successfully develop and deploy its robotaxi fleet, it could be a major game-changer for the company. Robotaxis could generate transformation growth for Tesla. But when? That's the big question. Continued growth in the EV market: The EV market is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, and Tesla is well-positioned to benefit from this growth. The company has a strong brand, a loyal customer base, and a growing product portfolio. Regulatory changes: Government policies are becoming increasingly supportive of EVs. This could support sustained long-term demand for Tesla's products.  Shorter-term risks to our thesis include Tesla's Robotaxi Day in August, as well as its upcoming earnings release on July 23rd. Earnings could surprise to the upside, as the company recently reported better than expected deliveries for the second quarter. Key Takeaways Tesla's impressive track record of growth and innovation are nothing short of remarkable. But even so, we think the company's current valuation is unsustainable. In our view, Tesla faces a number of challenges: significant capital investment required to fund future growth, intensifying competition, product pipeline uncertainty, and a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. While continued growth is certainly possible, we think TSLA shares have priced in much of this potential. As such, we initiate coverage on Tesla, Inc. with a Sell rating.

Shares have risen more than 75% since 52-week lows hit in April.The extended rally comes as the car manufacturer beat on quarterly deliveries last week. Aside from production and delivery results, Tesla bulls have also highlighted the company‚Äôs fastest-growing segment ‚Äî its energy storage business.Smaller electric vehicle makers also reported better than expected deliveries last quarter.On Monday, Lucid (LCID) shares jumped almost 7% after the luxury EV startup topped production and delivery expectations for the second quarter. Chinese competitors Li Auto (LI), Nio (NIO), and XPeng (XPEV) also recently reported better-than-expected quarterly deliveries.Tesla slumped in the first half of 2024 amid tough competition abroad and some waning demand for EVs in the US. In an effort to reduce costs, the company embarked on a plan to cut more than 10% of its global staff earlier this year in what some analysts saw as a signal of tough times ahead.Tesla also slashed prices last year to spur sales and better compete with its Chinese peers.""There is still the risk of further price cuts ahead, and there [are] still further questions on fundamentals, we are still facing somewhat of an EV winter on demand,"" Barclays senior equity research analyst Dan Levy told Yahoo Finance last week.

Major U.S. equities indexes hit fresh highs to start a new trading week that will feature Congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the release of the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, and quarterly reports from banking giants to kick off earnings season.

The Dow closed the session slightly lower, down 0.1%. Shares of Corning (GLW) soared 12%, notching Monday's top performance among S&P 500 stocks, after the specialty glass maker boosted its guidance for the current quarter. The company attributed its improved outlook to high levels of demand for its optical connectivity products, which are used in generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares jumped 6.2% on Monday as several stocks related to AI gained. The provider of servers and data storage hardware has garnered intense attention from investors for its potential to capitalize on AI opportunities, with its stock price more than tripling since the start of the year.

Cloud-based commerce company Salesforce also plans to invest as the transaction closes.More from WWDSaks COO Departs for Another GigInvestigation Into Tourist's Killing at Fashion Island Continues Following Three ArrestsSaks' Tracy Margolies and Manolo Blahnik's Andrew Wright on the Power of PartnershipIt‚Äôs a deal that comes with plenty of questions.Will brands get squeezed as America‚Äôs two main luxury department stores come together?¬†Will U.S. regulators even allow the deal given their opposition to Tapestry Inc.‚Äôs $8.5 billion buyout of Capri Holdings? And just what is Amazon up to?Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment for this story, but the answers should start to become more clear as the deal goes before the Federal Trade Commission and then, if it is approved, as Saks Global gets on its feet.Consultant Greg Portell, senior partner and global markets lead at Kearney, is watching to see how Amazon manages the investment.‚ÄúAre they managing it as part of an investment portfolio like a VC fund or a PE fund would, or are they going to manage it as if this is a strategic partner where they‚Äôre going to codevelop opportunities?‚Äù Portell said.Amazon might also be mindful of the broader dynamic in retail generally.‚ÄúThere is an argument to be made that Amazon is propping up a sizable competitor in the department store space just to keep the space viable,‚Äù Portell said.Amazon has dabbled in some creative dealmaking in multibrand retail before, like in 2019 when it cut a deal with Kohl‚Äôs Corp. that gave it warrants to purchase 1.7 million shares of the retailer, which started accepting Amazon returns. (Those warrants are fully vested now, but have an exercise price of $69.68 while Kohl‚Äôs shares are trading at $22.38).By investing in Saks Global, Amazon is going after a more lucrative shopper, which Portell described as the company‚Äôs ‚Äúlast frontier.‚Äù‚ÄúThe luxury consumer is an incredibly important segment of the consumer base that Amazon has an underrepresentation in,‚Äù Portell said. ‚ÄúAffluent consumers have buying power, have less price sensitivity, have more advanced tech acceptance. They are an incredibly appealing consumer for any retailer, and it‚Äôs a difficult one to break into because the brand value is so important.Story continues‚ÄúAmazon grew up as basically a democratic retailer where everyone has access and they‚Äôre ubiquitous,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the antithesis of luxury, which is scarcity and aspiration.‚ÄùAnd so, Amazon seems keen on opening up a back door of sorts into luxury.‚ÄúAmazon has a real challenge in getting luxury/affluent brands to list products on their platform,‚Äù said one source, a prominent investor in fashion. ‚ÄúBy acquiring a stake in this deal, they are likely planning to put the squeeze on those brands over time, at a minimum by listing the brands through Saks/Neiman‚Äôs on the Amazon marketplace.‚ÄúAmazon knows that the ‚Äòtrue luxury‚Äô brands don‚Äôt want to pull out of Neiman‚Äôs and Bergdorf (in particular), so this is an interesting chess move for Amazon,‚Äù the investor said. ‚ÄúMy guess is that their investment, at least in the context of Amazon globally, isn‚Äôt that large.‚ÄùWith a market capitalization topping $2 trillion and cash on hand of more than $73 billion, Amazon does not need Saks or Neiman Marcus or, really, fashion.But Amazon is as big and successful as it is in large part because it has focused relentlessly on its customer.And clearly the company believes its customers want it to carry more luxury goods.Amazon is¬† patient, tenacious and not letting go.As founder Jeff Bezos told shareholders in a 2008 letter, ‚ÄúIf we can identify a customer need and if we can further develop conviction that that need is meaningful and durable, our approach permits us to work patiently for multiple years to deliver a solution.‚ÄùIn high-end fashion, a solution has been elusive.Amazon has been working for years to make its mark in the pinnacle luxury, particularly with its Luxury Stores platform.But despite gaining traction with more aspirational fashion brands like Coach and premium beauty brands like Clinique, Amazon has only broken through with a few top luxury brands, like Oscar de la Renta.Now, the company is set to own at least a small piece of luxury retailing.Just what Amazon plans to do with that stake remains to be seen.Best of WWDWhat the Highest-paid CEOs at U.S. Fashion and Retail Companies MakeConfidence Holds Up, But How Much Can Consumers Take?San Francisco Authorities Seize Nearly $2 Million in Suspected Stolen MerchandiseView comments",,True,Amazon has invested in a $2.65 billion deal to merge Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus.

WfK3yJ4tQMcMGRB,Seeking Alpha,bing,UnitedHealth Group: The Perfect Portfolio Balancer,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4703016-unitedhealth-group-the-perfect-portfolio-balancer,2024-07-08 17:18,2024-07-08 17:37,UNH,,"WolterkUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is set to report its second-quarter results next Tuesday, July 16, amid a tough year for managed care and the company. Investors will closely monitor management's ability to weather the hell-storm of the cyberattack, higher medical costs, declining Medicaid eligibility, competition, and regulatory scrutiny. For a company that maintains a significant premium over its peers, this could either be a demonstration of extreme resiliency, which will strengthen the market's view, or a potential break point. With that, let's discuss why I still view UnitedHealth as a key holding and an attractive investment, and dive into the key aspects to monitor in the report. Introduction I've been covering UNH on Seeking Alpha since February 2023, maintaining a bullish rating throughout the period. I have to admit, it has been a tough 16 months. The company's secular tailwinds remain solid, and I think it's safe to say UNH clearly demonstrated its ability to capitalize and execute. However, so many temporary headwinds have piled up, and the stock's performance clearly reflects that. Long-Term View On Secular Tailwinds And Industry Leadership Before we dive into the near-term catalysts, I want to start by briefly reviewing my long-term investment thesis in UnitedHealth. Let's start here:   Created and calculated by the author based on CMS projections and data.According to the CMS, domestic health expenditures are expected to grow at a 5.6% CAGR between 2022-2032, reaching nearly 20% of GDP by the end of the period. Breaking that into parts, Medicare and Medicaid expenditures are expected to grow by 7.4% and 5.2%, respectively, while physical & clinical services, private health insurance, and hospital spending, are all expected to grow around 5.6%. There are plenty of businesses that should capture value from this trend, but I don't think there's a company that comes remotely close to UNH with its expansive presence across the entire value chain. Data by YChartsMany companies are trying to mimic the UNH model, but they are all quickly learning this is a very tough business. Competitors like CVS (CVS) and Humana (HUM) tried to win customers at all costs and were caught with their pants down as soon as medical costs rose. Meanwhile, during this very tough period for the industry, UnitedHealth continues to execute according to its initial guidance, which many thought was too ambitious, and that's despite having to deal with a major cyberattack. The bottom line is, UnitedHealth is the clear leader of a resilient industry that should grow at a mid-to-high-single-digit pace. That's a great baseline for a market-beating investment. Healthcare As A Portfolio Balancer It is no secret that tech is the sector to be in right now. Led by strong results and generative AI enthusiasm, technology is leaving the rest of the stock market in the dust. Data by YChartsOver the past three years, the healthcare index (XLV) significantly lagged the S&P 500, which has a large exposure to technology. However, if we take a longer lens, healthcare is one of the best-performing sectors in the S&P 500. Data by YChartsThis shouldn't come as a surprise. We've already discussed the industry's secular tailwinds. Interestingly, healthcare had the strongest revenue growth in the S&P 500 since 2010.   Created and calculated by the author using data from S&P Global I expect UNH will continue to outpace the above-market growth of its industry. Therefore, it provides a great way to balance a portfolio with a non-tech name, that is still able to grow faster than the market average. Now, let's dive into the near-term situation. Key Factors To Monitor In Q2 Coming into the first-quarter report, investors were very worried about a mix of headwinds, which primarily include higher medical costs and the Change cyberattack. Numbers came in better than expected, and despite fears of a guidance downgrade, UNH maintained its targets for the year. This was effectively an upgrade, as the new guide included some cyberattack-related costs. The stock surged to as high as $520 and then lost momentum after comments made by management on Medicaid headwinds, and another very strong tech rally. In the second quarter, the number one thing to monitor will be the cyberattack. Management quantified its direct response costs at ~$1.1 billion, and revenue loss at ~$400 million. If they raise that, that would give a negative signal about their ability to take control of the situation, but I don't expect that to happen. Setting that aside, there will, of course, be the usual fundamental factors to monitor. Medical Costs UnitedHealth demonstrated it's a level above the competition when it comes to understanding the healthcare industry, foreseeing what's about to come, and having the ability to deal with fluctuations.   Created by the author using data from UnitedHealthcare Group reports.As such, it is one of the few companies that weren't caught off-guard by the rise in utilization trends. It didn't have to cut guidance, and it didn't approach the 90% levels of some of its competitors. In Q2, MCR is expected to remain stable, and we should hope to hear this will be the case for the rest of the year. Membership Growth One of the problems with the new entrants in the industry is that they were quite aggressive with their benefit offerings, whereas UNH maintained a balanced approach. However, to achieve this, UNH had to sacrifice some growth.   Created by the author using data from UnitedHealthcare Group reports.We can see that members are still growing, especially in the very important commercial cohort. However, Medicare and Medicaid lost some members. It'll be interesting to hear what management has to say about the fact that competitors are now talking about a margin focus, as UNH stands to benefit from their change in strategy. Optum Profitability & Growth The Optum arm aggregates what makes UNH special. It is also the growth driver for both revenues and profits. Of the three Optum segments, Optum Health is by far the most important, as this is where the company's long-term value-based strategy comes to bear.   Created by the author using data from UnitedHealthcare Group reports.I expect margins in the Optum Health department to remain above the 20% threshold, and revenue growth to remain in the mid-teens. Commentary about continued progress in value-based penetration will also be crucial. Valuation This will be pretty straightforward. Historically, UnitedHealth traded in the 18x-22x P/E range. During that period, revenues grew at a low-double-digit pace, while operating income and EPS grew in the mid-teens. Data by YChartsLooking ahead, UNH is still committed to mid-teens EPS growth, although more of it will come from buybacks, rather than net income. In addition, as the company reaches a larger scale, revenue growth should be in the high-single-digit range. On the contrary, it is more profitable today, and its leadership position in the industry, in my view, has never been clearer. All in all, I think that an 18x multiple is a reasonable expectation, even slightly leaning too pessimistic. Data by YChartsThat brings me to a price target of $550 a share by the end of 2024, based on consensus estimates for 2025. It's worth noting that UNH beat estimates for 15 consecutive years, and I have higher expectations for 2025, but let's leave it at that for now. Conclusion UnitedHealth is set to report its second-quarter results in a week, as investors once again seek reassurance that the company is weathering the storm of current headwinds. I expect no surprises regarding the cyberattack and another quarter of better-than-expected results. Therefore, I encourage investors to capitalize on the ongoing pessimism surrounding the company, as UNH's secular growth trajectory remains intact.  Buy reiterated.",,False,,,,,,,,,,,,
