Celsius' lead investigational asset is CEL383, a potential first-in-class anti-TREM1 antibody that has completed a Phase 1 clinical study for the treatment of IBD.TREM1 has been identified as a key disease driver gene in IBD, where it is expressed on inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils. In these cell types and others, TREM1 is upstream of multiple known inflammatory pathways and acts as an amplifier of inflammation.""Given the potential relevance of TREM1 as a key driver of inflammation and pathology in IBD and other conditions, we are eager to advance the development of CEL383 with a goal of helping more patients with IBD achieve remission,"" said Kori Wallace, M.D., Ph.D., vice president, global head of immunology clinical development, AbbVie.""AbbVie shares our excitement about the potential of TREM1 inhibition for patients with inflammatory disease,"" said Tariq Kassum, M.D., chief executive officer, Celsius. ""I'd like to thank the Celsius team for their relentless efforts in the discovery of CEL383. We look forward to the further development of this promising program, which we hope will offer a new approach to the treatment of IBD.""Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie has acquired all outstanding Celsius equity for $250 million in cash, subject to certain customary adjustments.About CEL383CEL383 is an investigational antibody directed towards TREM1. In preclinical assays, CEL383 has been shown to inhibit TREM1 signaling, reducing the levels of multiple inflammatory mediators of high clinical relevance in inflammatory conditions.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to conditionally approve odronextamab to treat adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The positive opinion will be passed on to the European Commission, which is expected to announce a final decision in the coming months. Follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are the two most common subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The former is a slow-growing subtype and incurable, while the latter is an aggressive subtype, with up to 50% of high-risk patients experiencing progression after first-line treatment. In Europe, an estimated 46,000 cases of the two subtypes are diagnosed each year.  More on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
